00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.359
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.640
Cut!

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.079
I'm so happy.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.560
Nuannuan.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.960
Don't you feel...

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:40.559
that only when you're surrounded by water,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.640
do you truly feel...

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:44.799
alive?

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:48.439
What about me?

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.079
Only with you here...

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.840
do I feel my world is complete.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:04.479
Don't worry.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.680
I'll stay with you forever.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:08.359
Pinky swear.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.480
Come on. (Support Admin Watch on

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.640
Who's there?

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.400
"Candy"

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.700
(Episode 3: Wifey, I Was Wrong)

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.319
So?

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.560
Is handling work tough?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.159
I think this job is pretty fun.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.960
What's going on?

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.439
What are you doing?

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.816
This house has been repossessed by President Shen.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.199
Shoo, shoo!

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.680
Don't get in the way.

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.399
What nonsense are you talking?

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:58.719
This is clearly Lin Can's home.

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:02.199
President Shen.

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.879
So you're the new assistant by Lin Can's side?

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:09.479
Who is she?

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.000
That's none of your business.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:13.439
Lin Can.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.680
Haven't seen you in days.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.759
You've lost weight.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.080
Stop moving things, halt!

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.240
Shen Hao.

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:22.960
Are you in such a hurry...

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.080
to kick me out?

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.520
How could I?

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.159
I can't wait...

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.280
for you to join our family sooner.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.080
President Shen,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.400
managing Xingyu is really a waste of your talent.

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.520
You should become an actor.

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:40.759
I know.

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:42.639
I know you blame me.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.400
For halting your work...

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.479
without a word,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.680
and seizing your villa.

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.000
I'm doing this to protect you.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.520
Your scandal is all over the news now.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.439
I had to make you...

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:53.520
vanish from the public eye for a while.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.720
What you think, what you do...

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:56.080
I don't care at all.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.240
If you show no mercy,

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.000
don't blame me for not saving face for Xingyu later.

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.159
Who's the one evading taxes?

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.520
You know very well.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.639
You probably don't want to lose...

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.559
everything you've worked for all these years.

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.599
Don't worry.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.800
As long as you're willing to bow to me,

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.600
I can fix all of this.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.519
My capability...

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:20.879
you know it.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600
Shen Hao,

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:23.959
after all these years,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.279
you're still so pathetic.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.680
You know what?

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:30.959
Deep down,

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:33.360
you've always been a clown to me.

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:40.959
Fine.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.240
Very well.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.160
Wen Nuannuan is back.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.160
You must be thrilled.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.040
I'll take you to a movie later.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.600
Okay.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.360
Xiao He.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.199
Who's this?

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.399
This is a good friend...

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:05.415
I met at my new school.

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.879
Wen Nuannuan.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.759
Nuannuan,

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.576
this is the friend I always told you about,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.079
Shen Hao, from before I transferred.

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:12.439
He's two grades above us.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.480
Not only does he excel in studies,

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:15.839
he's also very loyal.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.560
Hello, Senior Shen Hao.

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:19.959
Hello.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.360
Hello, Nuannuan.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.815
Don't listen to Xiao He's nonsense.

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:31.999
I'm not as great as she says.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.560
Alright, don't just stand here.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.199
Let's go watch a movie.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:34.399
Okay.

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:35.679
You stay here by yourself.

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.439
She abandoned you back then.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.199
Why are you still hung up on her?

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:49.399
Tell me,

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.759
if what happened back then gets exposed,

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.719
do you think you'll still be able to protect her?

00:06:02.532 --> 00:06:03.525
From now on,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.360
keep a close eye on this house.

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.279
If those two show up here again tomorrow,

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.199
watch your step.

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:16.639
You...

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.560
Tch. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:26.240
I'll give you one more day.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.000
You must move out tomorrow.

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:35.839
Are you okay?

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:40.279
Nuannuan.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.160
Looking forward to our cohabitation?

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:47.759
Mm.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.360
Well, this is great.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.560
Truly bankrupt now.

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:03.039
But raising one little dog...

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:04.399
is still more than manageable.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.160
Who's a little dog?

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.720
Go pack my luggage.

00:07:12.546 --> 00:07:13.986
We're moving to your place tomorrow.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:15.639
What about you?

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:17.800
I'm going to take a bath.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.160
Relax a bit.

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:27.639
Tell me,

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:29.959
if what happened back then gets exposed,

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:32.919
do you think you'll still be able to protect her?

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.160
Nuannuan's parents,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.040
isn't there...

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:48.319
some misunderstanding?

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:49.839
What misunderstanding?

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:51.920
I saw it with my own eyes!

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.920
Those two...

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.560
lip to lip!

00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:57.439
Let me tell you,

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.920
your daughter is the one who corrupted our Nuannuan!

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.480
Disgusting!

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:04.519
You think just because you're rich,
you're something special?

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:05.759
Today,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.639
you have to give me an answer!

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:09.719
Compensate our Nuannuan for her... her...

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.360
emotional damages!

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.000
Auntie!

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Otherwise...

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.480
this isn't over!

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.040
Play the piano.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.039
If you don't listen to me,

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:35.999
I'll transfer you to another school.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.759
You'll never see her again.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.960
Remember:

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.639
You belong to me.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.120
Remember:

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:50.120
You belong only to me.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.879
Miss Jiang, rest assured.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.280
Lin Can's work has been completely suspended,

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.535
and the villa has been reclaimed.

00:09:04.559 --> 00:09:05.559
I handled it personally.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
This way,

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:08.039
in all of Xingyu,

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:09.440
no one will overshadow you anymore.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.159
President Shen is so diligent...

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:15.655
because you're afraid I'll expose how you
embezzled company funds for futures trading

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:17.480
and lost everything, aren't you?

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.480
Of course not.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.720
From now on,

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:21.599
if there's anything you need me for,

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:22.799
just say the word.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.000
Transfer Si Han to my side.

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:29.639
Back then, it was Si Han...

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:32.839
who single-handedly made the unknown Lin Can a star.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.240
She's a rare talent.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:36.919
But...

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:38.679
she's fiercely loyal to Lin Can.

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:40.720
Feel free to use her.

00:09:43.905 --> 00:09:45.645
Precisely because she protects Lin Can,

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:47.559
I want to take her away.

00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:49.879
Watch her destroy...

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:51.519
the person she cares about most.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.840
That's the best revenge.

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:04.936
We're leaving just like this?

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.960
Not taking anything?

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:08.696
The most important thing is already with me.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.720
What is it?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Stop asking.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240
Let's go.

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:57.879
Why is your place like a dump?

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.960
I've just been too busy.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.519
The sofa...

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.240
not bad.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.440
Pretty comfy.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.080
You're sleeping on the couch tonight.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.720
This is *my* home.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.679
Assistant Rule Number Two:

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:11.080
Everything...

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.519
revolves around the star.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.759
Go heat some milk for me.

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:18.759
I won't.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.200
You won't?

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:35.799
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go!

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.240
I want it hot.

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:45.799
Got it.

00:12:02.039 --> 00:12:03.039
President Shen.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.519
Regarding the decision to suspend Lin Can's work,

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:05.960
I hope you'll reconsider.

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:08.840
The negative rumors about her are baseless.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.759
All these years, Lin Can...

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:12.000
has contributed so much to Xingyu.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.159
You've seen it all.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.480
Si Han.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.639
This is the board's decision.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.720
There's nothing I can do.

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:30.559
Besides,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.720
I'm only asking her to lay low temporarily.

00:12:33.879 --> 00:12:35.279
Once the public opinion calms down,

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:36.839
I'll have her make a comeback.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.240
But you know very well,

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.960
this is completely malicious slander.

00:12:41.559 --> 00:12:42.559
The tax issue was clearly...

00:12:42.559 --> 00:12:44.080
an accounting error at work.

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:45.279
Twisted by people with ulterior motives...

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:46.279
Enough!

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.600
Know your place.

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:50.399
Starting tomorrow,

00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:53.559
you'll be in charge of Jiang Wan's agency affairs.

00:12:58.519 --> 00:12:59.720
I'm Lin Can's manager.

00:13:01.039 --> 00:13:02.039
I was, (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:03.679
and I always will be.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.200
If you refuse,

00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:16.759
not only will all her resources be cut off,

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:20.011
but the losses incurred by the company due to her
personal issues will also be fully accounted for.

00:13:20.036 --> 00:13:21.175
(Terms of Studio Termination)

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.200
Weigh the pros and cons.

00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:23.679
You know what's at stake.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.120
Stay with the company,

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.480
and there will be a chance for her comeback.

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:39.600
Long time no see,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.320
Wen Nuannuan.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.120
Si Han.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.480
Welcome back.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.360
Let's be clear upfront:

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.040
I'll only handle your business affairs.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.440
Also,

00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:05.440
don't just barge into my office.

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:08.639
I told you,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.519
I'd bring you back to my side.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.360
What's wrong?

00:14:18.679 --> 00:14:19.679
Miss Jiang,

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.599
so eager... to have
me be your dog?

00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:26.720
It's been so long.

00:14:28.039 --> 00:14:29.279
Haven't you missed me?

00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:38.879
Si Han.

00:14:39.919 --> 00:14:41.759
Do you think I can still make it big?

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.279
Today's audition...

00:14:43.919 --> 00:14:45.679
the director said my acting was terrible.

00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:51.599
Who told you to play a killer while constantly batting your eyelashes?

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.520
But your action scenes were decent.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.200
When it comes to pulling the female lead's hair during fights,

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.360
no one can beat you.

00:15:00.159 --> 00:15:01.519
Stop it, it hurts!

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.399
Then say, “I'm sorry, Princess.”

00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:08.399
I'm sorry, Princess.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.559
Not sincere enough.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.200
Again.

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:15.279
Alright, alright, alright!

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:16.879
I'm sorry, my dear wife.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.320
Who told you to be such a famous star?

00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:23.320
Please don't hold it against a small fry like me.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.480
That's more like it.

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:30.399
Dear wife,

00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:33.599
could you get me a bottle of water from the fridge?

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.200
Sure.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.960
Happy birthday.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.080
Si Han.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.240
Thank you.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.039
I have things to do.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.120
I'm leaving first.

00:17:03.039 --> 00:17:03.759
Si Han.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
See?

00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:06.880
You still care about me.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.240
Goodbye,

00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:11.519
darling.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.000
I heard you're going to be Jiang Wan's manager.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.000
You got the news fast.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.279
Jiang Wan told me herself.

00:17:30.519 --> 00:17:31.519
I knew it.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.480
My situation is only temporary.

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:34.359
Don't worry.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.640
I'll handle your matters.

00:17:36.519 --> 00:17:38.200
Just take good care of yourself.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.839
Everything's fine on my end.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.280
It's just that the place I'm staying is too...

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.079
great!

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.400
Extremely comfortable.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.960
Shen Hao has started showing his true colors.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.280
I need to stay in the company to find evidence.

00:17:52.319 --> 00:17:53.319
Take care of yourself.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.119
No drinking,

00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:54.599
no speeding. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:17:54.599 --> 00:17:55.599
You're so naggy.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.480
My little assistant watches me tighter than the paparazzi.

00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:00.119
Just rest assured.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:01.680
Si Han.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.160
Thank you.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.240
How can someone...
grill corn until it's like charcoal?

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.319
Is this even edible?

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.640
Plenty of people want to eat it.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.160
Back then, people begging me to grill corn for them...

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.039
would line up from here...

00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:43.479
all the way to Xingyu's entrance.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.119
That popular?

00:18:47.519 --> 00:18:48.759
Who else did you grill for?

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:51.240
It couldn't be...

00:18:52.039 --> 00:18:53.119
Sister Si Han, could it?

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:56.880
Not telling.

00:19:02.952 --> 00:19:04.511
Look at your messy face.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.200
If you don't tell me,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.760
I'll take a picture of your messy face

00:19:07.839 --> 00:19:08.920
and post it online.

00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:12.559
Are you going to tell me?

00:19:13.079 --> 00:19:14.279
It was Sister Si Han, right?

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.960
I warn you,

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.160
don't get so close to me.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.480
Or else...

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:22.119
Or else what?

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.720
Guess who?

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:48.799
Not working and causing trouble?

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.880
Careful, or I'll grill you too.

00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:52.599
I don't believe you.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.160
Here, drink some water.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.920
Look at your face.

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:05.159
Like a little smudge-face.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.000
Alright, alright.
I'll stop.

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:11.480
Look,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.200
this is a new paper crane I folded.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:13.960
How is it?

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.480
The wings aren't crooked, right?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
So ugly.

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:21.559
What's ugly?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Your wound...

00:20:25.279 --> 00:20:26.279
does it still hurt?

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.640
No.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.480
You hate me.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.960
That's not it.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.920
Then you li...

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.240
I don't know.

00:20:49.079 --> 00:20:50.400
Let's just stay like this.

00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:52.279
Stay good friends forever.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Okay?

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.880
You—you're drunk.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.599
It's good to see you and Lin Can back together.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.160
What exactly...

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.080
does this Shen Hao want?

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.440
This time,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.119
can Xiao He and I be brave enough to be together?

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.319
What is Jiang Wan trying to do?

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.960
Now she's playing the disappearing act?

00:22:21.519 --> 00:22:22.279
I'm sorry.

00:22:22.279 --> 00:22:23.519
The number you have dialed...

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.960
is currently unavailable.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.160
Miss,

00:22:45.599 --> 00:22:46.400
I'm sorry,

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:47.640
but we're closing.

00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:56.719
Why does this wine taste more bitter the more I drink?

00:22:56.759 --> 00:22:58.240
More bitter than my life.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:59.960
Another glass.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.880
The kind that...

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.160
after drinking,

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.240
lets you see...

00:23:04.519 --> 00:23:05.680
whoever you want to see.

00:23:05.799 --> 00:23:07.519
But we need to close and clear the venue.

00:23:07.759 --> 00:23:08.240
Miss,

00:23:08.279 --> 00:23:09.359
you should head home early.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.960
Shut up!

00:23:11.319 --> 00:23:12.519
Even you reject me?

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:15.799
Do you know who I am?

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.920
I'm a star!

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.720
Beautiful,

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.480
great acting skills,

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.519
top-tier!

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:26.000
Yes, yes, yes.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.680
So what?

00:23:29.759 --> 00:23:30.759
Some people...

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.119
just have no taste.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.359
They only like trash.

00:23:37.319 --> 00:23:40.720
“I believe you're just afraid of hurting me,

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.079
not lying to me...”

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.759
“Then what should I learn...”

00:23:47.784 --> 00:23:48.735
(Si Han calling)

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:54.759
Miss,

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.240
someone named Si Han...

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.480
has been calling you.

00:23:57.599 --> 00:23:58.599
Is she your friend?

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.440
Should I ask her to pick you up?

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.200
Si Han...

00:24:04.839 --> 00:24:07.039
She couldn't care less about me.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.759
Jiang Wan.

00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:16.119
What's all this about?

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.640
If you're unhappy with me,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.640
you can ask President Shen...

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.640
to replace me.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.255
Pulling a disappearing act in the middle of the night? How childish.

00:24:22.279 --> 00:24:23.200
Hello?

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.640
Is this Ms. Si Han?

00:24:25.079 --> 00:24:25.640
Who is this?

00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:26.839
Where's Jiang Wan?

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.920
Ms. Jiang is currently at Classroom.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.599
But...

00:24:30.839 --> 00:24:31.839
she's already drunk.

00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:33.079
Could you take her home?

00:24:34.079 --> 00:24:35.079
Okay, I understand.

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:37.720
Please look after her for a bit.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.720
I'll be there soon.

00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:41.319
Mm, thank you.

00:24:59.559 --> 00:24:59.920
Goodbye.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.200
Darling.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.599
Si Han.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.480
It's you.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.480
Long time no see.

00:25:31.845 --> 00:25:32.845
Si Han...

00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:39.160
Bro, this wine of yours...

00:25:39.359 --> 00:25:40.359
really works.

00:25:43.079 --> 00:25:43.680
No...

00:25:43.799 --> 00:25:45.079
I need to keep sleeping.

00:25:45.799 --> 00:25:47.039
It's better in dreams.

00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:51.160
Before, (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.960
we always saw you picking up that lady with the motorcycle.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.359
Didn't expect this time it's...

00:25:55.559 --> 00:25:56.559
the KTV lady.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.480
Sorry for the trouble

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.920
so late at night.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.440
Neither of them is easy to deal with.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.720
Who?

00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:05.039
Who, me?

00:26:05.132 --> 00:26:07.052
You must be someone very important to Ms. Jiang.

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:08.599
Me?

00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:10.599
We're just colleagues.

00:26:12.079 --> 00:26:13.599
But tonight when she got drunk,

00:26:13.599 --> 00:26:14.815
you were the only one who cared.

00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:15.839
And also...

00:26:16.279 --> 00:26:18.319
you're the emergency contact in her phone.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.400
You're saying...

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.400
I'm her emergency contact?

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.440
Paid yet?

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:29.759
Charged already.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Let's go.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.240
Get up. Come on.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.400
Easy.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.759
Alright, I warn you, stop pretending.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.599
Alright, alright, alright.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.279
How did you know I was faking it?

00:26:48.599 --> 00:26:49.599
Speaking of which,

00:26:50.039 --> 00:26:52.320
you came as soon as I called, in the middle of the night.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.920
Actually...

00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:56.079
you still care about me, right?

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.240
Don't you know?

00:26:57.759 --> 00:26:59.216
Instead of wasting time messing with me,

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.720
you should practice your acting more.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.200
Since you're not drunk,

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.319
take a taxi home yourself.

00:27:06.319 --> 00:27:07.319
Miss Jiang.

00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:27.759
Get on.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.640
A big star like me...

00:27:35.799 --> 00:27:37.440
riding your little scooter?

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.519
Take it or leave it.

00:27:38.647 --> 00:27:40.007
I lost my car keys during the day.

00:27:40.039 --> 00:27:41.399
I need to report it to the police.

00:27:42.839 --> 00:27:43.839
About that...

00:27:44.519 --> 00:27:46.720
I think I accidentally took them.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.400
One more question.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.480
Shoot.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.680
This helmet...

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.599
did Lin Can also wear it?

00:28:05.839 --> 00:28:06.839
Get off!

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.960
No!

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.440
Jiang Wan.

00:28:21.559 --> 00:28:22.920
Let's go watch a movie tonight.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.680
Who's that girl?

00:28:31.839 --> 00:28:32.960
That's Senior Si Han.

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:35.000
She's a famous top student at our school.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.880
So what if she's a top student?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.200
Her personality isn't great.

00:28:38.519 --> 00:28:39.720
She doesn't have any friends.

00:28:39.759 --> 00:28:40.240
Let's go.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:40.759
Let's go.

00:28:40.759 --> 00:28:41.000
Let's go.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.400
Go.

00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:49.559
Senior Si Han.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.200
Yes?

00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:53.079
What?

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.400
Shouldn't you ask...

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.839
who I am, what's my name?

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.627
Who are you?

00:28:58.819 --> 00:29:00.012
Hello, my name is Jiang Wan.

00:29:00.037 --> 00:29:01.317
I'm a sophomore in Finance.

00:29:01.746 --> 00:29:02.746
Are you free tonight?

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:03.840
I'm not.

00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:05.559
How about tomorrow?

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.880
Not then either.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.000
The day after?

00:29:08.119 --> 00:29:09.639
You must be free the day after, right?

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.100
