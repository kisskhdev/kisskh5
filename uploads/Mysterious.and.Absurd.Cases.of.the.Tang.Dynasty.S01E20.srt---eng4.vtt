00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.800
What are you doing?

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.720
Don't blame me.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.840
If your sworn brother hadn't led Dali Temple...

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.120
...and driven me to a dead end...

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.920
...I wouldn't treat you like this.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.840
I thought you only looked fierce...

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.920
...but were kind at heart.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.640
Who knew you would actually commit...

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.240
...such an act that outrages gods and men.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.680
I had no choice.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.600
You told me...

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.880
...your dad was executed by the Imperial Court.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.680
You owe your life to your sworn brother.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.040
If he were not long for this world...

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.400
...would you save him?

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.480
Would you save him at any cost?

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.520
I...

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.480
I would.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.200
I owe my life to my Master.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.360
I don't care about the outrage of gods and men.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.680
I only seek my own peace of mind.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.640
This... is the knife wound I got...

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.800
...when I fled last night.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.360
When and where were you injured last night?

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.520
Hai Hour, not far from Wanhua Fang.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.880
Then why...

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.640
...did you tear off the deceased's face?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.920
It was to prevent the authorities...

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.600
...from identifying the deceased.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.000
So there would be nowhere to investigate.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.320
Very well. Then please...

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.400
...draw the image you carved on the deceased.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.120
Since you can carve on flesh...

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.480
...it must be effortless on paper.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400
If you can truly draw it...

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.080
...Dali Temple will convict you...

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.160
...and spare the one you are determined to shield.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.040
Tong'er

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.200
Tong'er

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.120
This...

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.400
They found you

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.640
You...

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.840
Master

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.600
Master

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.720
Why are you doing this?

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.920
Tong'er

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.040
My days are numbered anyway

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.480
Let them catch me if they will

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.680
Tell me

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.480
Where did you go tonight?

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.320
What did you do to them?

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.560
You must tell me everything in detail

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.120
I went to Wanhua Fang tonight

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.760
At the Hour of Hai

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.040
I killed them

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.280
I took their livers

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.000
I slashed their faces

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.200
What else?

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.320
That's all

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.080
This child... he deceived me in the end

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.080
Craftsman

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.040
Do you know of a dark art in the underworld

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.880
Called Wooden Puppet Life-Borrowing?

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.280
As expected of someone from Dali Temple

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.840
This room is full of the smell of medicinal plaster

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.440
I presume the terminally ill person he wants to save

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.640
Is you, right?

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.200
That's right

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.240
It is me

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.880
Do you really believe in that life-borrowing dark art?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.960
At first

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.600
Tong'er wanted to kill people to save my life

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.200
I tried to stop him

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.320
But people...

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.800
The closer they get to death

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.600
The more easily they succumb to fear

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.280
The more fear is in the heart

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.120
The... the harder it is to accept

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.520
Why I am such a short-lived person

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.760
Why Heaven is so unfair to me

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.200
The more fearful one is

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.520
The harder it is to let go

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.840
The more reluctant the heart becomes

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.480
Later, I stopped trying to hold him back

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.160
I said... let him be

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.720
It's all my fault

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.400
It's all because of my greed

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.400
I wanted to try again

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.480
Extremely foolish

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.360
Where is he now?

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.040
The woman who gave birth to me

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.160
Was a prostitute

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.680
Since childhood, I was despised by everyone

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.400
They cursed me

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.040
Beat me

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.720
Pointed at my nose and called me a prostitute's son

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.600
As if

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.400
I was born to be

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.120
Like a puppet for people to smash

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.720
In my anger, I destroyed my own face

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.480
I wanted them to fear me

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.480
But who knew

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.160
Not only were they not afraid of me

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.080
I became a monster

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.800
An evil thing

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.400
Xi Rou

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.440
Besides Master

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.280
Only you are willing to look at me directly

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.200
You're not hurt, are you?

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.960
Get away, you ugly freak!

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.200
You scared my child!

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.000
Ma'am, please.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.240
You shouldn't say that.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.360
This young man...

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.640
...he only meant well.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:32.760
Meant well?

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.600
What good could he mean?

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.880
Look at that ugly face!

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.480
He'll scare the life out of my child.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.880
Young man.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.280
What is your name?

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.560
My name is Xi Rou.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.520
My home is not far ahead.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.720
Come have some tea when you're free.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.840
From the first moment I saw you...

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:58.800
...I wanted...

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.920
...to give all the remaining goodness in my heart...

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.680
...to you.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.960
But fate is cruel.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.320
Once I save Master's life...

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.240
...I will die too.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.240
I will use this worthless life of mine...

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.840
...to repay you.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.360
Stop this!

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.720
Turn back, Brother Liu Tong.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.880
Don't be so stubborn.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.280
Don't make any more mistakes.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.560
From the moment heaven gave me this worthless life...

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.080
...all of this was destined.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.240
I won't let you feel any pain.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.240
My dirty hands...

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.440
...are not worthy.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:31.960
Stop!

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:33.800
Tong'er!

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:34.600
Xi Rou!

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.640
Liu Tong, let her go!

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.120
Master.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.160
Tong'er can extend your life right now.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.120
Tong'er, Life-Borrowing is an evil art of the underworld.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.720
It is a delusion.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.720
I didn't stop you before...

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.320
...and that was my mistake.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.080
Listen to me now.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.280
Let go.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.800
Let go!

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.000
It is not a delusion!

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.080
Master...

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.480
I can save you.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.280
I know I can save you.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.200
The Five Viscera are only missing one now.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:09.960
I'll use my own!

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.080
I can definitely save you!

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:12.520
Stop!

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:12.760
Tong'er!

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.120
Master!

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.440
Tong'er...

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.880
Look at me now.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.960
Is this worth continuing your mistakes for?

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.520
I was wrong.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.640
I was afraid of death and clung to life.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.320
I forced you down a path of no return.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.760
My selfishness...

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.360
...has ruined my only...

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.200
...my only apprentice.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:52.960
Master...

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.560
Child...

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.240
Let it go.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.840
You are still young.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.760
Don't burden yourself with so much sin.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.800
Master...

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.720
Please...

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.000
I believe that in your heart...

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.680
...there is still goodness left.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.440
Otherwise, you wouldn't have kept that painting of the mother and child.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.240
I understand...

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.560
...what is in your heart.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.960
Don't mention that Witch to me ever again!

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.560
In this life...

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.760
...I only have Master.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:57.720
Liu Tong!

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.200
Guiyi

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.640
Order Dali Temple

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.040
to find Liu Tong's birth mother

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.560
and bring him home.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.600
Come have some candy.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.240
I want some! I want some!

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.600
Me too! Me too!

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:31.640
Me too! Me too!

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.520
Give me one!

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.600
Me too! Me too!

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.040
Don't push. There's enough for everyone.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.120
One at a time.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.080
Me too! Me too!

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.840
I didn't expect my Vice Minister,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.600
usually so composed and steady,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.440
to have such a hideaway to relax.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.200
Share them among yourselves.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.640
These children have no parents.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.200
If no one looks after them,

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.080
how many would end up like Liu Tong?

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.280
You really are different from those in court

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.200
who only care about power and profit.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.840
I'm starting to admire you a little.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.560
Since you put it that way,

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.640
help me take care of them from now on.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.080
My Lord, Master.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.600
Liu Tong's mother has been found.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.960
Because Liu Tong went missing back then,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.080
his mother went mad searching for him.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.320
Hey, where is Xi Rou?

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.880
Guiyi, bury Liu Tong.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.760
As a law enforcer,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.840
yet able to balance law and compassion.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.920
Your Lord is quite decent.
