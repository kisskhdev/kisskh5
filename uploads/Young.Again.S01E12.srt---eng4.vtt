00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:54.260
Professor Fan

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:55.859
Since you got sick,

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:56.700
you've lost weight.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.060
You're skin and bones.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.260
You're so thin you're unrecognizable.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.780
Don't you think so, Yingzi?

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.219
Not really.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.500
I actually think Professor Fan has gained weight.

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:05.819
Probably from the illness.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.219
Edema. Puffiness.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.419
I don't think any of you are right.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.419
Professor Fan,

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.500
his weight hasn't changed much.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.099
It's mainly his vitality.

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.860
One look and you can tell he's not doing well.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.020
He looks exhausted.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.500
You look completely sickly.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.259
Zhu Zhu!

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.740
What are you saying?

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.500
Grandpa Fan,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.340
he's using the wrong words.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.379
I think,

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.580
you shouldn't call this a sickly state.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.580
It should be called a sickly appearance.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.699
Then you might as well call it a smoker's face.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.819
But Professor Fan doesn't smoke.

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.419
Students,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.900
actually, my illness...

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.139
is already cured.

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:40.840
So fast?

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.219
Yes.

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.560
Then you still need to rest and recover.

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:44.939
Stop writing all the time.

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.780
Exactly. Turn off the computer for Mr. Fan.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.259
I haven't saved it yet!

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:50.219
Students,

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:51.539
it's getting late.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:52.639
We should go back to the dorm.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.419
Let's not disturb Professor Fan's rest.

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:55.900
Aren't you leaving yet?

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.580
No...

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.080
I mean, thank you guys.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.840
Hurry up and go.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.919
No,

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:00.780
take care.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.379
I won't see you out.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.740
But as soon as we leave,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.099
Professor Fan will start writing again.

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.939
What should we do?

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:07.060
How about this?

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.340
I'll stay and take care of him for a couple of days.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.280
And supervise him while I'm at it.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.159
Don't.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.860
What kind of rotten idea is that?

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.699
Where would you sleep if you stayed?

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.460
Yangliu Xincheng Retirement Community has rules.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.219
No overnight guests allowed. Right.

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:19.560
So your idea won't work at all.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.000
It won't work.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.560
It won't work.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.900
Let's go.

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:21.860
Let's just...

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.939
take Professor Fan's computer...

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.919
away, wouldn't that work?

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:24.340
Don't!

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.960
No!

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:26.379
Never heard of such a thing.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.580
Why would you take Grandpa Fan's computer?

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.259
Exactly. Just unplug the power cord.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.219
Don't! You... No!

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:32.139
Sorry, Mr. Fan.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.419
To let you rest and recover in peace,

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.699
we'll keep this power cord for a week.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.699
Hey, Zhu Zhu,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.939
you're a grown-up,

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:40.259
why are you acting so childish?

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.939
Yeah.

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:41.979
Is this how you handle things?

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:42.860
You can't do that.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.539
Is just pulling the cord enough?

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:45.500
Then what should we do?

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.939
You have to take the battery too.

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:47.580
Don't!

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.780
You're right.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.500
Professor Fan,

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.300
you rest for now.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.020
We'll come see you another day.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.060
Bye, Grandpa Fan.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.719
Bye, Mr. Fan.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.139
Bye-bye now!

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:56.699
Come back!

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:58.659
Give me my stuff!

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:02.460
Come back!

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.659
What's going on with you guys?

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:13.020
Little Li.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.379
How is your skit coming along?

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:17.399
It's a disaster.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.819
Just miserable.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.500
As expected.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.180
We even made it to the semi-finals.

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:23.899
The busier it gets...

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.019
...the more trouble it is.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.439
Your skit performed pretty well too.

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.680
As soon as you went on stage, you triggered...

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.160
...prolonged and unceasing...

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.879
Listen to this.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:33.680
...crying.

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:37.019
And have already been gloriously...

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.439
...eliminated.

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:41.279
You...

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:43.879
You really have a sharp tongue, kid.

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.519
Getting eliminated...

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.839
...wasn't a big deal.

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:49.160
But the way you put it...

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.519
...makes me want to cry.

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:53.920
Your skit was indeed very touching.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.040
But this competition is for comedy skits.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.480
You guys turned it into a tragedy.

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.079
Do you think that could get a high score?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.139
Let's go.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.240
We won't give certain people...

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.040
...a chance to humblebrag. Let's go.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.120
Have you two finished eating?

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:15.759
Professor Fan

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:17.240
It's been a whole day.

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:18.180
Hard work.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.079
What do you want to eat?

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:19.759
I'll go get it for you.

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:20.600
Eat what?

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.079
I'm full from anger.

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:24.040
Who is it this time?

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:25.399
Who else but you?

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:26.120
With you.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.160
I didn't mess with you today.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.120
I didn't write a single word again today.

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:31.720
Just because you didn't write a word,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.560
why are you taking it out on me?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.720
If not for that lousy idea you gave me,

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.720
telling me to fake being sick,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.519
would it have ended up like this?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.120
Today was just great.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.399
Three waves of visitors came by.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.199
Bringing flowers and fruit.

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:47.199
It seems that for this problem,

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.879
I should take the main responsibility.

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:49.240
Right.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.279
Whoever tied the bell must untie it.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.160
I'll help you solve it.

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:55.199
You solve it? How?

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:56.600
Take the flowers that were sent,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.240
and give a bunch to every room.

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.240
No need to worry about the leftover fruit.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.680
I will help you

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.040
finish it off.

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:05.199
In your dreams.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.720
Do I need you to solve that?

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.720
I spent the whole day just greeting guests.

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:11.800
I didn't write a single word.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.439
This problem hasn't been solved.

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:15.639
And those college student volunteers,

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.959
they almost took my power cord and battery.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.920
I had to chase them all over.

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.040
Look how much time I wasted today.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.699
Don't be so anxious.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.500
You have to look at both sides of the issue.

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:28.459
Use dialectics.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.860
On the surface,

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:32.540
time was indeed wasted.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.660
But in reality?

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.540
It was wasted.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.860
Isn't that nonsense?

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:39.060
Although time was wasted,

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:40.699
what about the progress?

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:42.660
Of course, that was delayed too.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.860
That's still nonsense.

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:44.660
Look at you.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.540
Getting anxious again.

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.019
Aren't I helping you figure this out?

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:49.420
Why did I tell you to fake being sick?

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.019
Wasn't it because you get too many calls?

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.220
Yes, that's true.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.459
Then I have to ask.

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:56.980
Why do people

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.180
call you all the time?

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.100
They want me to give lectures,

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:02.300
attend seminars,

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:03.740
or commission book drafts.

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:05.540
Oh, and they want me on TV

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:06.339
as a guest.

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:08.579
Your main job right now

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:10.500
is to finish your manuscript.

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:12.259
How do you have the time

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:14.019
for so many social activities?

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:16.939
Refusing them outright

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:19.160
is definitely out of the question.

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:20.759
Throwing away your phone,

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.779
you definitely wouldn't like that.

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:23.459
Sigh.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.579
I told you to fake being sick,

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:26.899
but then all those visitors came.

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:29.139
I say we just...

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:32.500
You go hide out of town.

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:35.939
Now you get it, right?

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:38.420
I don't mean for you to actually go out of town.

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:39.819
I get it.

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:41.459
You mean physically, I...

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:42.860
stay in Beijing to write.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.740
If there's a phone call,

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.060
I just say I'm out of town.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.860
You want me to lie?

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.319
Right?

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:46.860
Right.

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:49.300
Don't make it sound so ugly.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.379
This isn't called lying.

00:07:53.019 --> 00:07:54.699
It's called the art of language.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.660
It's a white lie.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.180
It's different from regular lying.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.100
You know?

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.139
Right.

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:03.379
This is good for your creative work.

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:03.920
Isn't it?

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.560
Yes.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.060
If the person calling has something urgent,

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.779
I'll just say I happen to be coming back tomorrow.

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:10.660
If it's nothing urgent,

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.139
I'll say I can't come back tomorrow.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.540
I have to say,

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.579
you, Professor Fan, regarding talking nonsense...

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:16.300
No.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.019
Lying.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.579
White lies.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.699
The art of language.

00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:23.819
You catch on pretty fast.

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:25.779
Shows you have a real talent for this.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.540
Isn't that still just talking nonsense?

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.579
It's not talking nonsense.

00:08:29.579 --> 00:08:30.379
It's a lie...

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.659
It's the art of language.

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:34.179
Same thing.

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:38.139
Why are you intellectuals so pedantic?

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.740
If someone invites you to a symposium,

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.980
invites you to give a speech,

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.299
and you don't go, it hurts their feelings.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.779
But if you do go,

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:47.539
it delays your work.

00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:48.460
So what do you do?

00:08:49.059 --> 00:08:50.899
That... that really is a tough one.

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:53.340
Exactly, so listening to me is the right move.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.620
This...

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.539
Pretty busy.

00:08:57.539 --> 00:08:58.299
Hello?

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.340
Editor Zhao.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.059
Hello.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.379
Sorry about that.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.940
I've been really busy lately.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.220
Say you're out of town!

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.940
Say you're out of town!

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:08.779
No, no.

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:10.419
It's me who is out of town.

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:11.980
Where am I out of town?

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:13.220
Where am I out of town?

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.179
Just say anywhere!

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.940
I'm in Shanxi.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.940
Where in Shanxi?

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.100
Chengde, Shanxi.

00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:20.340
That's in Hebei!

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.899
I'm in Shanxi Hebei.

00:09:22.379 --> 00:09:24.059
No, I'm in Hebei Shanxi.

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:25.539
I...

00:09:25.539 --> 00:09:27.899
I'm in that... Chengde, Hebei.

00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:30.259
Getting old, the brain doesn't work so well.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.820
Editor Zhao, what did you need me for?

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:34.379
Oh.

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:37.299
My "New Interpretation of Classical Poetry Metrics"?

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.220
It's been published?

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.259
Thank you.

00:09:39.259 --> 00:09:40.179
Thank you so much.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.299
Then hurry up and send it over to me.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.740
I have time.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.659
You're in Chengde, how do you have time?

00:09:46.539 --> 00:09:48.019
Right, I'm in Chengde.

00:09:48.019 --> 00:09:48.460
Right?

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.840
Alright then.

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:52.659
Okay.

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:53.860
We'll talk later then.

00:09:54.379 --> 00:09:55.179
Goodbye.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.580
So dumb, really dumb.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.500
It's all your fault.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.860
You insisted I say I was out of town.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:01.139
What was it this time?

00:10:01.259 --> 00:10:02.700
They wanted to bring me my royalties.

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:04.059
So what?

00:10:04.059 --> 00:10:05.259
Just say you're coming back tomorrow.

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:06.460
He'll bring the money over tomorrow.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.419
Isn't that the best of both worlds?

00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:08.659
What "best of both worlds"?

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.500
Their accountant is going on a business trip tomorrow.

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:13.179
You tell me...

00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:19.360
Hello.

00:10:25.299 --> 00:10:26.379
It's miserable.

00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:32.000
Just miserable.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.700
We still have to go to the district for the finals.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:36.659
So go participate.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.659
Who asked you?

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.100
You two...

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.059
Asked or not...

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.419
I made it to the finals too.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.059
Speaking of which, it's really strange.

00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:52.559
That you can actually act.

00:10:54.539 --> 00:10:55.539
That's where you're clueless.

00:10:55.539 --> 00:10:57.139
I'm a professional.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.659
An arts backbone.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.779
Once I make a move,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.899
I'm better than average.

00:11:02.299 --> 00:11:03.820
Who among average people can't act?

00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:05.019
Unless they're a fool.

00:11:06.259 --> 00:11:08.039
That's why I find it strange.

00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:10.259
That you can actually act.

00:11:10.259 --> 00:11:11.299
What do you mean "actually"?

00:11:12.299 --> 00:11:13.100
What does that mean?

00:11:13.659 --> 00:11:14.940
So you're saying I'm a fool?

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.059
You said that yourself.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.820
This old pedant, hey.

00:11:20.019 --> 00:11:22.100
Unleashing your sharp tongue again.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.740
Let me tell you.

00:11:24.259 --> 00:11:26.580
I play the lead based on talent.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.500
Based on my artistic sense.

00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:29.980
Based on Director Xiong from the theater,

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.139
Chasing me to praise my acting.

00:11:32.139 --> 00:11:33.659
And kept asking why, in my youth,

00:11:33.659 --> 00:11:35.019
I didn't go professional.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.860
Director Xiong was chasing you?

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.539
He was afraid you'd stiff him.

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.620
And not pay his fee.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:42.919
Exactly.

00:11:42.919 --> 00:11:43.899
That's not true.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.460
Director Xiong came to our community,

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.860
As a public service.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.980
He doesn't charge.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.259
You're just crying sour grapes.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.340
Our Changqing House is in the finals.

00:11:52.539 --> 00:11:54.480
Your Yannian House was eliminated.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.740
What's so great about the finals?

00:11:58.059 --> 00:12:00.460
Does being in the finals mean you'll win?

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.460
You never know.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.379
Say, if you happen to get

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:07.059
A judge with bad eyesight,

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:08.820
You might actually win.

00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:11.059
Bad eyesight... it's possible.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.539
We entered to win.

00:12:14.539 --> 00:12:15.820
Making the finals this time,

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.440
We must take the crown.

00:12:22.419 --> 00:12:23.539
Am I right?

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.740
Calls have dropped off, right?

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:27.899
As long as you say you're out of town.

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:29.399
The calls have decreased.

00:12:29.659 --> 00:12:30.740
But what about my royalties?

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.940
Royalties, royalties again.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.740
We'll talk later.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.340
You're not in a rush to spend it.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.500
I planned to take these royalties,

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.440
And donate them to my alma mater.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.899
Is your alma mater in a rush?

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.220
Then I'll advance it for you.

00:12:43.539 --> 00:12:44.500
Tell me how much you need.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.340
Not much, just around fifty thousand.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.700
How much will you advance me?

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:48.740
I can...

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.100
Make your alma mater wait.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.620
Just focus on finishing the manuscript.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.659
Don't get distracted.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.580
Hello? Who is this?

00:13:03.379 --> 00:13:04.299
Oh, Lao Qian.

00:13:04.539 --> 00:13:05.779
Say you're out of town.

00:13:06.539 --> 00:13:07.500
Say you're out...

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.059
No...

00:13:08.059 --> 00:13:09.940
No, I mean, I'm out of town.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.100
In Chengde, Hebei.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.500
What?

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:15.139
You're in Chengde too?

00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:17.059
This is all your "great" idea.

00:13:17.059 --> 00:13:18.500
He's in Chengde too. What do I do?

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.379
Don't say you're in the city center.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.460
Say you're in a county within Chengde.

00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:26.480
I'm not in Chengde city right now.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.980
I'm in a certain...

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.539
Which county?

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.440
Longhua County.

00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:35.759
Where the hero Dong Cunrui sacrificed himself.

00:13:37.179 --> 00:13:38.580
I'm in Longhua County.

00:13:39.139 --> 00:13:41.299
The place where the hero Dong Cunrui died.

00:13:41.659 --> 00:13:43.500
No... Yes, it is that place.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.500
What?

00:13:44.779 --> 00:13:45.940
You're in Longhua County too?

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:48.299
Darn it.

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:50.740
No, I mean, what a coincidence.

00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:52.580
How is this possible?

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.500
You've really screwed me over.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.340
No...

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.940
I mean, my socks need mending.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.059
Where am I staying?

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.460
I'm staying at the County Guesthouse.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:02.620
What?

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.059
You're at the County Guesthouse too?

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:05.740
Then...

00:14:06.059 --> 00:14:08.059
I'm in room 407.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.460
You're in 307?

00:14:10.659 --> 00:14:12.019
You absolutely must not come up.

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:12.779
I'm not in.

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:15.100
No, I mean, right now...

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.200
I'm not in the room.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.179
I'm out at a meeting.

00:14:18.179 --> 00:14:19.019
It'll go on until very late.

00:14:19.019 --> 00:14:20.259
I won't be back until midnight.

00:14:22.059 --> 00:14:23.580
You want to treat me to a late-night snack?

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.299
No need.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.019
Really, no need.

00:14:25.019 --> 00:14:27.019
I'm not being polite, no.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.940
Let's leave it at that for now, okay?

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:30.700
I'm in the meeting right now.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.860
I have to speak soon.

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:33.100
I'm hanging up now.

00:14:36.659 --> 00:14:37.820
Why are you glaring at me?

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.259
I didn't expect such a coincidence either.

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:41.740
So tell me, what should I do now?

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.379
He insists on treating me to a late-night snack.

00:14:43.899 --> 00:14:44.700
What do I do?

00:14:45.379 --> 00:14:46.259
What do I do?

00:14:48.659 --> 00:14:50.100
Go to Longhua now.

00:14:50.659 --> 00:14:52.659
Anyway, Longhua isn't too far from Beijing.

00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:54.659
If you leave now, you can still make it.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.820
You want me to travel all that way?

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.500
Just to eat a late-night snack?

00:14:58.419 --> 00:14:58.899
I...

00:14:58.899 --> 00:14:59.700
What about my manuscript?

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.679
What about it?

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:01.899
You tell me what to do.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.080
Now you're asking me what to do?

00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:08.779
No choice, I guess I have to go.

00:15:09.419 --> 00:15:10.460
So annoying. Let me tell you...

00:15:10.539 --> 00:15:11.820
You can't blame this on me.

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:12.860
Chengde...

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.500
You were the one who said it first.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.139
If you hadn't said Chengde,

00:15:16.179 --> 00:15:18.500
we wouldn't be dealing with Longhua now, right?

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:22.940
Forgot my computer.

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:24.460
Right.

00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:31.019
Don't forget your ID card.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.379
True.

00:15:36.179 --> 00:15:37.059
Don't forget to bring...

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.820
What else?

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:41.779
Don't forget to bring...

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.779
Bring back some local specialties.

00:15:44.779 --> 00:15:45.460
Bah!

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.240
I just don't understand

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.919
why you insist on staying in room 407.

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:03.080
This room...

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.200
This place...

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.720
It's shady and leaks rain.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.399
The AC is broken.

00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:09.159
The toilet is clogged too.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.279
The TV has issues too.

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:14.240
And the internet cuts in and out.

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:16.799
Someone can't come fix it until tomorrow.

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:21.639
You staying in this room...

00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:23.159
isn't it inconvenient?

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.519
Well...

00:16:26.559 --> 00:16:27.679
that's because...

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.879
I stayed in this room three years ago.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.240
I'm attached to it.

00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:32.480
That can't be right.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.399
Our guesthouse...

00:16:33.399 --> 00:16:35.320
only officially opened last year.

00:16:36.919 --> 00:16:38.240
Then I must have remembered wrong.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.840
Seems my language arts still need polishing.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.360
You go ahead and get busy.

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:43.480
I'm going to rest a bit.

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:44.600
Thanks a lot.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:58.360
Lao Qian.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.600
I've arrived in Longhua.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.440
I mean...

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.640
I'm back at the Longhua County guesthouse.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.240
Why don't you come up?

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.160
To my room.

00:17:12.039 --> 00:17:12.759
Didn't you say...

00:17:12.759 --> 00:17:15.119
you'd treat me to a late-night snack tonight?

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:18.359
What?

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.240
You're in Beijing?

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:21.920
No...

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.039
Didn't you say...

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.039
Is that any way to joke around?

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.680
No...

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.359
No, how can I not be anxious?

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:33.359
I came all the way from Beijing...

00:17:34.599 --> 00:17:36.920
Forget it. We'll talk later.

00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:44.000
Shenzhou went to space.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.079
The national football team clocked out.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.119
Memorizing lines is easy...

00:17:48.119 --> 00:17:49.200
why can't I get this down?

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.200
The national football team...

00:17:51.119 --> 00:17:52.160
The national football team what?

00:17:54.359 --> 00:17:56.039
I don't believe I can't memorize this.

00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:57.160
The national football team...

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.480
Hello?

00:18:06.599 --> 00:18:07.559
Little Fan.

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:09.400
How are things over there?

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.720
No...

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.680
How about this, I...

00:18:18.359 --> 00:18:20.079
Hey, can you listen to me for a second?

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.119
How was I supposed to know they were joking?

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:27.119
Wasn't I doing it for your own good?

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.039
Just stay there and write in peace.

00:18:30.599 --> 00:18:31.359
You might as well stay in Longhua...

00:18:31.359 --> 00:18:33.200
and finish that book before coming back.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.680
Blame me?

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.079
Can you really blame me?

00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:39.440
Honestly.

00:18:40.279 --> 00:18:41.359
Just stay there.

00:18:41.359 --> 00:18:43.559
Thinking of coming back... honestly.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.119
I won't look, I just won't look.

00:18:49.279 --> 00:18:50.079
The national football team...

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.079
How can the national football team go to space?

00:19:22.339 --> 00:19:23.059
You're back.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:27.980
Out for a stroll?

00:19:33.579 --> 00:19:34.740
Second prize.

00:19:36.539 --> 00:19:38.180
Wasn't President Li determined to win?

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.059
Wasn't it first prize or nothing?

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.140
As leaders, we...

00:19:42.859 --> 00:19:43.619
how can we...

00:19:43.619 --> 00:19:46.220
compete with the masses for titles and awards?

00:19:47.339 --> 00:19:48.660
Second prize is fine.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.500
First prize...

00:19:51.259 --> 00:19:53.460
let Songhe Residence have it.

00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:55.740
President Li, your mindset...

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.099
is really quite elevated.

00:19:57.259 --> 00:19:58.299
I think...

00:19:58.579 --> 00:19:59.259
in this competition...

00:19:59.259 --> 00:20:00.980
if you hadn't played the male lead...

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:01.700
maybe...

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.900
our Changqing Residence could have won first prize.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.819
It's possible.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.220
What do you mean by that?

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.420
Exactly what I said.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.400
Always spouting nonsense.

00:20:10.779 --> 00:20:11.579
Come in.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:15.980
Editor Song.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:17.980
Hello.

00:20:18.019 --> 00:20:19.259
Why did you bring gifts?

00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:22.180
You could have just sent a junior editor.

00:20:22.259 --> 00:20:24.220
Why come in person?

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.599
Come, sit.

00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:29.059
Okay.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.259
Okay, thanks.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.099
You received the manuscript, right?

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.019
We received it.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.779
I'm sorry, Mr. Fan.

00:20:37.059 --> 00:20:38.940
I heard that to rush this draft...

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.099
you worked yourself sick.

00:20:41.619 --> 00:20:42.740
Just a minor ailment.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.539
Our agency leadership instructed me...

00:20:45.779 --> 00:20:47.180
to come visit you specifically...

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.619
and express our apologies.

00:20:51.099 --> 00:20:52.259
You're too kind.

00:20:53.059 --> 00:20:54.299
I'm the one who should apologize.

00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:56.140
I rushed as fast as I could...

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.259
but was still three days late.

00:20:57.259 --> 00:20:58.440
I must have delayed your work.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.779
Not at all.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.380
That you could finish the manuscript in ten days...

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.940
the young editors in our agency...

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.019
all say you have god-like speed.

00:21:08.339 --> 00:21:09.220
Nowadays...

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.859
only a highly respected...

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.220
old-school scholar like you...

00:21:13.299 --> 00:21:15.440
could possibly submit the draft half a month early.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.220
What?

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:21.380
Early?

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.180
Didn't you ask me...

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.940
within one week...

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.380
to finish the manuscript?

00:21:27.299 --> 00:21:28.099
No.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.180
What we said was...

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.539
just finish it within a month.

00:21:31.779 --> 00:21:32.619
A month?

00:21:33.059 --> 00:21:36.140
You just need to finish your manuscript within a week.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.460
There's absolutely no rush.

00:21:41.839 --> 00:21:42.559
Lao Li!

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:45.740
Li Jianguo!

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.740
Get back here!
