WEBVTT

00:00:52.407 --> 00:00:53.741
Does he know that

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:56.244
you're marrying a man in his 70s?

00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:05.879
Your face is getting
more and more interesting.

00:01:07.255 --> 00:01:09.966
It will be even more interesting
if he finds out.

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:13.303
Hey.

00:01:21.728 --> 00:01:22.687
You tell me.

00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:25.398
Who do you think I am?

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:40.914
You said you were an uninvited guest.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.082
Then,

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:45.752
do your job properly.

00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:49.547
He is… (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:51.883 --> 00:01:53.301
the man I hold dear.

00:01:58.264 --> 00:02:00.433
There will be a wedding soon.

00:02:06.564 --> 00:02:10.068
Right. And he's an aide
at the constabulary.

00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:15.740
And his name is…

00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:16.908
Yeol.

00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:19.244
That's my name.

00:02:22.622 --> 00:02:24.374
If what you said is true,

00:02:24.457 --> 00:02:26.542
I do not feel like introducing myself.

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:30.296
Then let us leave it at that.

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.302
What brings you here at this hour?

00:02:37.053 --> 00:02:39.430
To keep my family under control.

00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:48.773
Look, Hong Eun-jo!

00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:51.401
You're here with the Young Master?

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.319
Young Master!

00:02:54.612 --> 00:02:56.781
How much did you drink?

00:02:58.116 --> 00:03:00.284
Why is there blood on your face?
Did you get hurt?

00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:02.370
Let me help you up first.

00:03:04.414 --> 00:03:06.290
Where's Jae-i? Has he already left?

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:10.003
My brother-in-law!

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:13.256
Enough. Enough with that.

00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:15.049
Stand up now.

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:18.845
When will Eun-jo be here?

00:03:19.262 --> 00:03:21.431
She said she'd come
once her duties are done.

00:03:21.514 --> 00:03:24.684
Maybe she's treating someone again.

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:25.727
She must be.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.230
We can't celebrate this day
without Eun-jo!

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:31.190
Including me,

00:03:31.274 --> 00:03:34.610
everyone here got her help.

00:03:34.694 --> 00:03:36.612
-Right.
-That's right!

00:03:39.532 --> 00:03:40.658
Who is this Eun-jo?

00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:41.784
Right.

00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:44.620
She's also known as Physician Hong.

00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:46.247
The Hyeminseo's--

00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:47.874
Hyeminseo, I see.

00:03:49.834 --> 00:03:52.128
His Highness must be there too.

00:03:57.967 --> 00:03:58.926
Look here.

00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:01.971
"Control" is

00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:04.849
what a man who upholds
law and order does, like me.

00:04:05.183 --> 00:04:08.102
It is not something
you impose on your fiancée.

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:11.606
Oh, dear.

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.441
It was not her,

00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:16.194
but the way you looked at her

00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:17.445
that I controlled,

00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:18.363
to be precise.

00:04:18.446 --> 00:04:20.114
Then you got it right.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.951
But unfortunately,
she just drew a line between us.

00:04:24.369 --> 00:04:25.453
That means

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:28.748
she has done nothing to need control,

00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:30.833
nor will she ever.

00:04:31.334 --> 00:04:32.585
Just keep that in mind.

00:04:32.668 --> 00:04:34.587
Especially if you're her fiancé,

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.755
you should know.

00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:40.301
When will you throw your punch?

00:04:40.593 --> 00:04:41.844
I have a feeling it'll be soon.

00:04:41.928 --> 00:04:43.346
At least warn me so I can dodge it.

00:04:44.222 --> 00:04:45.390
I grew up early.

00:04:46.224 --> 00:04:48.017
I outgrew fistfights long ago.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.773
Besides, given my position,

00:04:53.856 --> 00:04:55.650
I'm more used to a sword.

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:57.693
Or poison, when it's convenient.

00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:00.071
Scary.

00:05:00.613 --> 00:05:01.656
Should I be scared?

00:05:01.739 --> 00:05:02.657
If you have to be.

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.411
Why is everyone making such a fuss
over this lowly girl?

00:05:06.744 --> 00:05:08.788
I don't like the way you talk.

00:05:08.871 --> 00:05:10.581
That's just the facts.

00:05:10.873 --> 00:05:13.584
She's nothing more than a lowly concubine,
sold into our family--

00:05:13.668 --> 00:05:15.461
That's it.

00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:17.713
I think I've shown enough courtesy
for Eun-jo's sake.

00:05:19.048 --> 00:05:20.508
What are you doing?

00:05:21.092 --> 00:05:22.468
What are you doing?

00:05:22.552 --> 00:05:24.512
-Move.
-Why are you doing this?

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:27.265
This is interesting.

00:05:27.807 --> 00:05:29.183
Please leave.

00:05:33.354 --> 00:05:34.230
Thank you

00:05:34.897 --> 00:05:36.607
for all your help so far.

00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:38.025
I hope

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:39.694
this is the last time we meet.

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:42.738
-Eun-jo!
-Eun-jo!

00:05:42.822 --> 00:05:44.532
Hong Eun-jo!

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.410
-Eun-jo!
-Where are you?

00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:49.620
-Eun-jo!
-My dear Eun-jo…

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.833
What do you think this triangle is about?

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.751
It feels like

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.046
we should give them some space, right?

00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:03.134
All right, everyone. Take ten steps back.

00:06:03.217 --> 00:06:04.594
-One.
-One.

00:06:04.677 --> 00:06:06.137
-Two.
-Two.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.555
-Three.
-I made it too!

00:06:07.638 --> 00:06:09.223
I knew you'd be here.

00:06:10.183 --> 00:06:11.225
What? Let go of me.

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:12.143
Wait.

00:06:15.521 --> 00:06:18.232
The aide will be joining you as well.

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:25.031
I will.

00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:45.092
You ask him.

00:06:45.176 --> 00:06:47.094
You're His Highness' right-hand man.

00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:49.472
And you're His Highness' confidant.

00:06:53.142 --> 00:06:54.143
Your Highness…

00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:57.897
what happened with Physician Hong?

00:07:03.361 --> 00:07:04.278
Your High--

00:07:11.244 --> 00:07:13.913
Let me apologize
for what happened earlier.

00:07:14.497 --> 00:07:16.374
It seems I ended up helping you

00:07:16.457 --> 00:07:18.042
rather than disrupting you.

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:19.669
Actually, you managed to do both.

00:07:19.752 --> 00:07:21.712
Shouldn't you look happier then?

00:07:22.463 --> 00:07:26.926
You managed to keep the last shred
of your pride from your admirer.

00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:32.348
"And then

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.518
they lived happily ever after."

00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:38.521
I may be a lowly girl,

00:07:39.438 --> 00:07:41.732
but I want to be remembered that way.

00:07:44.777 --> 00:07:46.529
There was no other intention.

00:07:46.946 --> 00:07:48.155
That really was it.

00:07:48.614 --> 00:07:50.283
You can go and tell him now,

00:07:50.366 --> 00:07:52.285
if you must ruin that too.

00:07:56.914 --> 00:07:59.125
It will not be pleasant
when you pay for this.

00:08:00.084 --> 00:08:01.127
Sure.

00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:28.571
It really looked like

00:08:28.654 --> 00:08:31.616
the two men were competing
over Eun-jo, right?

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:32.658
Yes.

00:08:32.742 --> 00:08:34.368
Who was the other man?

00:08:34.744 --> 00:08:35.828
That is

00:08:36.454 --> 00:08:37.496
a mystery.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.456
You're here.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:40.541
He seemed like he's from a noble family.

00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.627
Physician Hong say anything about him?

00:08:43.127 --> 00:08:44.754
She's not saying anything.

00:08:45.212 --> 00:08:47.298
She seemed a little down this morning.

00:08:48.466 --> 00:08:50.217
How's the aide doing?

00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:51.594
He's absent today.

00:08:52.345 --> 00:08:54.263
Have you heard

00:08:54.347 --> 00:08:56.932
any more news about Gil-dong?

00:08:57.266 --> 00:08:58.726
What about him this time?

00:08:59.644 --> 00:09:02.688
Is this because of the rumor?

00:09:03.606 --> 00:09:04.440
The rumor?

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:07.610
Make it quick.

00:09:12.531 --> 00:09:13.699
Did you look into it?

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:15.826
Chief Secretary Im's eldest son

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.454
brings this into the palace from Ming.

00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:21.957
They're seeds.

00:09:22.458 --> 00:09:24.251
What are these used for?

00:09:34.929 --> 00:09:36.847
I'm so tired these days.

00:09:37.264 --> 00:09:39.934
It must be
because it's become warmer outside.

00:09:41.143 --> 00:09:41.977
Right.

00:09:42.353 --> 00:09:45.439
Where did Grand Prince Dowol
get that ledger?

00:09:46.065 --> 00:09:47.483
He just came across it.

00:09:49.068 --> 00:09:50.903
You don't believe that, do you?

00:09:51.987 --> 00:09:54.198
Well, as long as my stepmother is alive.

00:09:56.492 --> 00:09:59.954
You two brothers
must have some interesting history.

00:10:00.037 --> 00:10:01.288
I'm tired.

00:10:02.873 --> 00:10:04.041
Chief Secretary Im.

00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:07.420
The matter is decided. Need I say more?

00:10:08.754 --> 00:10:09.839
No, Your Majesty.

00:10:10.423 --> 00:10:12.967
It was my needless concern.

00:10:18.806 --> 00:10:21.517
The Chief Censor's post lies vacant.

00:10:22.268 --> 00:10:24.145
Who shall fill the post?

00:10:26.439 --> 00:10:27.898
Is Hong Min-jik

00:10:28.774 --> 00:10:30.401
your friend, Secretary Im?

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.907
His Majesty wants Hong Min-jik now?

00:10:37.324 --> 00:10:39.285
I cannot fathom
what His Majesty is thinking.

00:10:39.827 --> 00:10:42.204
His Majesty wants it all.

00:10:42.288 --> 00:10:45.624
He wants both a tyrant's power
and a sage king's virtues.

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:48.586
The remonstrance
Lord Hong claims as frank counsel

00:10:48.669 --> 00:10:50.713
will be a threat to you, Father.

00:10:53.299 --> 00:10:54.925
If you cannot do it,

00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:56.802
I will step forward and make a decision.

00:10:56.886 --> 00:10:59.388
Lord Hong was bedridden
after his collapse in the Gyeongo Year,

00:10:59.472 --> 00:11:01.390
until he woke up a year ago.

00:11:01.849 --> 00:11:03.934
Even if he dies now,
no one would suspect--

00:11:05.478 --> 00:11:07.480
Watch your words.

00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:10.483
He is your father's old friend.

00:11:12.526 --> 00:11:13.819
Please tell His Majesty

00:11:13.903 --> 00:11:17.364
that I have yet to recover enough
to move about freely.

00:11:17.907 --> 00:11:19.241
Is it a rejection?

00:11:19.867 --> 00:11:22.077
Serving again as Chief Censor

00:11:22.495 --> 00:11:26.916
means my family could be placed in danger,
as in the Gyeongo Year.

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.252
Eun-jo has been through enough already.

00:11:30.753 --> 00:11:33.172
I cannot make her go through that again.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.176
What makes you believe that would happen?

00:11:37.259 --> 00:11:38.385
I just…

00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:41.347
cannot bend my principles.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.148
Then how about teaching at an academy?

00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:53.359
I can vouch for you in writing.

00:11:53.442 --> 00:11:55.402
The stipend should be enough

00:11:56.195 --> 00:11:57.780
to provide for your family.

00:11:59.698 --> 00:12:01.075
I'm always the one receiving help.

00:12:02.117 --> 00:12:03.285
Sa-hyeong.

00:12:03.994 --> 00:12:05.246
Thank you.

00:12:11.502 --> 00:12:13.212
I'm the one who should thank you.

00:12:16.048 --> 00:12:19.051
You saved me from the disgrace

00:12:19.468 --> 00:12:21.303
of taking my own friend's life.

00:12:32.523 --> 00:12:34.108
Shall I order them taken away?

00:12:35.276 --> 00:12:37.820
I hear you've been sleeping poorly.

00:12:40.155 --> 00:12:41.907
My only child

00:12:41.991 --> 00:12:44.952
has robbed me of sleep these nights.

00:12:46.954 --> 00:12:48.330
You do not look so well yourself,

00:12:48.914 --> 00:12:50.332
Your Majesty.

00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:54.211
My only husband also…

00:12:56.088 --> 00:12:58.090
I will say no more.

00:13:00.384 --> 00:13:03.554
It is a relief to have you here
in the cold palace.

00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:08.767
You must also have heard

00:13:09.602 --> 00:13:12.646
that the Grand Prince
has visited the King's chambers recently.

00:13:13.063 --> 00:13:14.106
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:13:15.441 --> 00:13:18.110
I do not know what prompted him

00:13:20.237 --> 00:13:22.364
to meet His Majesty in private,

00:13:22.448 --> 00:13:24.158
but it seems
the two brothers joined forces

00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:26.785
to bring a corrupt official to justice.

00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:28.912
You may think of it that way.

00:13:29.538 --> 00:13:32.041
You know how capricious His Majesty is.

00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:34.209
Did you forget about the Gyeongo Year?

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.754
How could I ever forget

00:13:38.714 --> 00:13:40.591
such an dreadful incident?

00:13:43.969 --> 00:13:45.471
I should not have brought it up.

00:13:46.305 --> 00:13:48.474
Let us not bring court affairs into this.

00:13:50.476 --> 00:13:51.518
Right.

00:13:51.602 --> 00:13:54.647
I am seeking a suitable match
for the Grand Prince.

00:13:55.773 --> 00:13:56.940
Is that so?

00:14:00.277 --> 00:14:01.320
Your Majesty.

00:14:06.492 --> 00:14:08.077
Is the Grand Prince inside?

00:14:08.452 --> 00:14:10.329
Today, I will finally settle his marriage…

00:14:12.164 --> 00:14:13.540
The royal physician is here.

00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:15.793
Is Yeol ill?

00:14:15.876 --> 00:14:17.753
There are no particular signs of illness,

00:14:17.836 --> 00:14:19.129
but over the past few days,

00:14:19.922 --> 00:14:21.840
he has not quite been himself.

00:14:26.845 --> 00:14:28.472
DUMPED

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:39.525
Look here.

00:14:39.608 --> 00:14:41.360
The music sounds too sad.

00:14:41.443 --> 00:14:42.528
Liven it up a little.

00:14:46.323 --> 00:14:48.158
My stomach hurts. Isn't this funny to you?

00:14:48.534 --> 00:14:49.952
Why should I laugh?

00:14:50.995 --> 00:14:51.829
Because I laugh.

00:14:51.912 --> 00:14:53.580
Can't you just support my laughter?

00:14:54.164 --> 00:14:55.207
Should I steal her?

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.667
I can disguise myself, seduce her

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.585
and take my revenge.

00:14:59.461 --> 00:15:00.337
What do you think?

00:15:00.796 --> 00:15:01.839
Your Highness.

00:15:02.923 --> 00:15:04.633
I'm the Grand Prince.

00:15:04.717 --> 00:15:06.343
I can steal whatever I want.

00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:09.680
I will show them what it's like

00:15:09.763 --> 00:15:11.432
to have absolute power.

00:15:14.143 --> 00:15:15.936
I don't think she'll be swayed

00:15:16.437 --> 00:15:17.938
by my wealth,

00:15:18.022 --> 00:15:18.939
my power,

00:15:19.023 --> 00:15:20.024
my status,

00:15:20.107 --> 00:15:20.983
my style

00:15:21.066 --> 00:15:22.026
and my appearance.

00:15:23.193 --> 00:15:25.654
For most people,
any one is enough to sway them.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.616
That's just how she is.

00:15:30.117 --> 00:15:32.119
She would not be swayed by any of them.

00:15:33.412 --> 00:15:36.874
The royal physician sent this letter
listing the Grand Prince's symptoms.

00:15:36.957 --> 00:15:38.167
The Queen Dowager ordered that

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.753
it be shared with physicians
across the country

00:15:40.836 --> 00:15:42.212
to determine his diagnosis.

00:15:43.505 --> 00:15:45.883
-Could it be hwabyeong?
-It can't be lunacy, right?

00:15:52.264 --> 00:15:53.932
What do you think?

00:15:55.934 --> 00:15:57.770
Are you asking me, sir?

00:15:57.853 --> 00:16:00.439
We must gather every mind we can.

00:16:00.522 --> 00:16:03.150
Please say what you think.

00:16:05.277 --> 00:16:08.864
Joy, anger, anxiety,
obsession, sorrow, fear, fright.

00:16:10.449 --> 00:16:13.160
His seven emotions are unsettled,

00:16:13.243 --> 00:16:16.163
so I suspect it may be melancholia.

00:16:17.414 --> 00:16:20.334
The symptoms seem similar
to those of a broken heart, don't they?

00:16:21.585 --> 00:16:22.503
A broken heart?

00:16:23.754 --> 00:16:24.963
I'm not sure.

00:16:33.138 --> 00:16:35.557
I hope this is the last time we meet.

00:16:36.934 --> 00:16:38.060
It will be.

00:16:39.812 --> 00:16:40.771
Broken heart?

00:16:43.232 --> 00:16:45.192
Is it really that hard?

00:16:46.151 --> 00:16:47.152
What did you say?

00:16:48.737 --> 00:16:49.780
Nothing.

00:16:49.863 --> 00:16:52.324
Who would dare reject the Grand Prince?

00:17:03.168 --> 00:17:04.753
I personally think

00:17:05.129 --> 00:17:07.214
Physician Hong's rejection
was a wise decision.

00:17:07.297 --> 00:17:09.049
Giving her heart lightly, only to part,

00:17:09.133 --> 00:17:11.260
does her no good.

00:17:14.012 --> 00:17:15.597
Who said it was light?

00:17:16.056 --> 00:17:17.516
You want to take her as a concubine?

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:20.477
You haven't even wed yet.
Her Majesty would be furious to know--

00:17:20.561 --> 00:17:22.771
You're getting far ahead of yourself.

00:17:23.522 --> 00:17:25.357
I never even got the chance
to start anything.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.275
Exactly.

00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:28.902
Nothing's been started,
so there's nothing to move on from.

00:17:30.779 --> 00:17:31.822
It keeps lingering.

00:17:33.699 --> 00:17:34.616
That face.

00:17:36.702 --> 00:17:38.579
Your face is getting
more and more interesting.

00:17:40.497 --> 00:17:42.332
Honestly, I don't like that physician.

00:17:42.416 --> 00:17:45.043
If she had a fiancé,
why did she do that to you that night…

00:17:48.881 --> 00:17:49.923
There he goes again.

00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:53.677
What's that?

00:17:55.846 --> 00:17:57.764
"Break"?

00:17:58.307 --> 00:17:59.433
You want them to break up?

00:17:59.516 --> 00:18:00.684
HYEMINSEO

00:18:12.112 --> 00:18:13.197
My lord.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.531
Heading home from duty?

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.743
Shall we walk together?

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.205
Have you been waiting for me?

00:18:21.288 --> 00:18:22.706
Would that be so wrong?

00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.168
I would love that.

00:18:34.009 --> 00:18:35.636
What are you thinking about?

00:18:37.971 --> 00:18:39.973
This all feels new to me.

00:18:40.682 --> 00:18:43.685
Just a year ago,
when you were on your sickbed,

00:18:43.769 --> 00:18:47.105
I couldn't even imagine
walking with you like this.

00:18:48.732 --> 00:18:51.985
Sa-hyeong offered me a post.

00:18:53.528 --> 00:18:56.323
He said there's an academy in Namwon
in need of a teacher.

00:18:57.157 --> 00:18:58.742
And I accepted the offer.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.746
But that's really far away.

00:19:03.205 --> 00:19:06.208
Your body has yet to fully recover.

00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:08.543
I won't push myself too hard.

00:19:09.086 --> 00:19:11.964
My mind would be more at ease there

00:19:12.047 --> 00:19:13.757
than it would be wasting time here.

00:19:14.967 --> 00:19:16.468
Then, when will you--

00:19:16.551 --> 00:19:18.220
I must leave in a few days,

00:19:18.303 --> 00:19:21.515
to arrive in time for teaching.

00:19:22.557 --> 00:19:25.936
Does that mean
you will leave before my wedding?

00:19:27.646 --> 00:19:29.064
I'm afraid so.

00:19:29.648 --> 00:19:32.442
He came all this way
because he felt bad about it.

00:19:33.402 --> 00:19:36.863
It might be a good thing
that he leaves before the wedding.

00:19:36.947 --> 00:19:39.658
I wanted to see your face

00:19:39.741 --> 00:19:41.243
adorned for the wedding.

00:19:43.662 --> 00:19:45.414
I will stay strong…

00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:50.294
and carry myself well through the wedding.

00:19:58.552 --> 00:20:01.888
I should get the medicine ready
for your trip.

00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:03.765
There's no need to hurry.

00:20:04.224 --> 00:20:07.936
If I want to find good ones,
I need to start looking now.

00:20:18.488 --> 00:20:20.032
I may be a lowly girl,

00:20:20.115 --> 00:20:21.867
but I want to be remembered that way.

00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:24.369
Thinking about calling it off again?

00:20:26.955 --> 00:20:29.166
Don't say it's for love
because that's nonsense.

00:20:29.875 --> 00:20:32.294
What's the real reason
you want to call off the wedding?

00:20:38.091 --> 00:20:39.384
Where are you going?

00:20:40.719 --> 00:20:41.845
To break it off.

00:20:46.266 --> 00:20:48.518
The Grand Prince
is associating with some physician?

00:20:49.436 --> 00:20:51.772
Other than that,
I found nothing suspicious.

00:20:51.855 --> 00:20:55.359
But I saw the second Young Master
meeting the Grand Prince at the Hyeminseo.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:06.078
Finally, we meet, Father.

00:21:06.703 --> 00:21:09.831
Each time I came, I couldn't meet you.

00:21:14.461 --> 00:21:16.380
Did you meet someone before coming here?

00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:20.008
That's an intimate question.

00:21:20.425 --> 00:21:22.761
I don't deserve such attention, do I?

00:21:24.388 --> 00:21:25.389
Right.

00:21:26.598 --> 00:21:28.517
You know your place,

00:21:28.934 --> 00:21:30.394
and that's your only virtue.

00:21:34.815 --> 00:21:35.899
Father…

00:21:36.316 --> 00:21:39.569
I happened to overhear
your conversation with Mother.

00:21:40.278 --> 00:21:43.407
Am I a lowly concubine's child,
not Mother's?

00:21:44.074 --> 00:21:45.409
How foolish of you.

00:21:46.034 --> 00:21:47.577
If you had pretended not to hear,

00:21:47.661 --> 00:21:50.205
you would have had
no one to fool but yourself.

00:21:50.288 --> 00:21:52.999
Why was I raised
as the son of your principal wife?

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.460
Is it because you only have one son?

00:21:57.087 --> 00:21:58.755
Do not be so disheartened.

00:21:59.297 --> 00:22:02.884
It cost me dearly
to silence your courtesan mother.

00:22:04.594 --> 00:22:07.097
So you're not completely worthless.

00:22:08.265 --> 00:22:10.851
You sold an animal for a hefty price?

00:22:11.768 --> 00:22:13.437
Is that what you're saying?

00:22:20.944 --> 00:22:23.697
I placed first in the exam.
Just what you wished for the family.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.533
And I will win the post
you long desired as well.

00:22:26.616 --> 00:22:28.660
So allow me too to take some credit.

00:22:29.911 --> 00:22:32.664
Call off the marriage arrangement
with the Queen Consort's family.

00:22:32.747 --> 00:22:34.457
I will not be your breeding horse.

00:22:34.875 --> 00:22:36.585
That is exactly what you are for.

00:22:38.211 --> 00:22:41.464
I do not wish for anyone flawed
to be born into this world.

00:22:41.882 --> 00:22:43.049
Unlike someone else.

00:22:49.806 --> 00:22:50.807
And?

00:22:51.808 --> 00:22:54.060
Is that why you interfered with my plan?

00:22:56.021 --> 00:22:57.772
Judging by how furious you are,

00:23:00.066 --> 00:23:02.110
I must have succeeded.

00:23:06.323 --> 00:23:07.324
Are you hurt?

00:23:07.991 --> 00:23:08.909
That little…

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:14.998
What's going on?

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.964
Did you speak to Jae-i about the ledger?

00:23:23.715 --> 00:23:24.883
No.

00:23:24.966 --> 00:23:27.260
You said the time was not yet right.

00:23:36.144 --> 00:23:38.897
Those herbs are for my lord,
so please give me the finest ones.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.357
Of course.

00:23:44.277 --> 00:23:45.445
She's smiling again.

00:23:47.155 --> 00:23:48.406
What is so…

00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:51.451
Can I have
some Mongolian milkvetch roots too?

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:56.623
What do you think you are doing?

00:24:00.043 --> 00:24:01.878
I warned you it wouldn't be pleasant.

00:24:03.421 --> 00:24:05.465
Let go of me!

00:24:10.553 --> 00:24:12.430
Is this about what happened the other day?

00:24:14.975 --> 00:24:15.850
I can't stand you.

00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:18.228
What is it this time?

00:24:18.311 --> 00:24:20.438
Seeing you play a nobleman's sister,

00:24:20.522 --> 00:24:22.983
pose as a filial daughter
caring for her father

00:24:23.066 --> 00:24:24.609
and dream of a "happily ever after,"

00:24:24.693 --> 00:24:27.237
all without knowing your place.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.613
I cannot stand any of it!

00:24:29.406 --> 00:24:31.283
I want you to live in misery,

00:24:31.866 --> 00:24:33.785
not walk around smiling.

00:24:34.661 --> 00:24:36.913
I want you to cry, scream
and blame the world.

00:24:37.455 --> 00:24:40.834
Because in reality,
no one is coming to your rescue.

00:24:46.172 --> 00:24:47.674
What are you trying to say?

00:24:48.258 --> 00:24:50.510
You want me to call off the wedding?

00:24:52.178 --> 00:24:53.221
The wedding…

00:24:53.805 --> 00:24:54.681
No.

00:24:56.057 --> 00:24:58.059
It's a deal.

00:24:58.143 --> 00:24:59.394
That deal is

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:03.565
a fight for survival,

00:25:03.648 --> 00:25:06.651
like you said, for a lowly girl like me.

00:25:08.028 --> 00:25:09.321
So it can't be called off.

00:25:11.239 --> 00:25:13.158
I appreciate your charity, though.

00:25:34.512 --> 00:25:35.722
How clumsy you are.

00:25:41.227 --> 00:25:42.187
What?

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.730
What's with that look?

00:25:52.614 --> 00:25:53.865
What is it?

00:25:54.908 --> 00:25:56.117
Did something happen?

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.417
I'm just surprised to see you so suddenly.

00:26:04.876 --> 00:26:05.877
What are you doing here…

00:26:07.379 --> 00:26:08.671
Are you

00:26:08.755 --> 00:26:10.632
here to see me?

00:26:11.383 --> 00:26:12.717
You wish.

00:26:13.718 --> 00:26:15.428
No, I can't say that.

00:26:15.512 --> 00:26:16.596
Because you're right.

00:26:17.055 --> 00:26:19.265
I went to the Hyeminseo,
and they said you were here.

00:26:19.682 --> 00:26:21.101
So I came to find you.

00:26:39.077 --> 00:26:40.161
Why did you want to see me?

00:26:40.245 --> 00:26:41.329
When's the wedding?

00:26:41.413 --> 00:26:42.956
Next year? The year after?

00:26:43.498 --> 00:26:45.542
It's best we don't keep
running into each other.

00:26:45.625 --> 00:26:47.127
I should not give him false hope.

00:26:47.836 --> 00:26:48.920
In ten days.

00:26:49.421 --> 00:26:50.463
Ten days.

00:26:51.548 --> 00:26:53.007
So there won't be enough time

00:26:53.091 --> 00:26:55.802
to flirt, joke around
or really get to know each other.

00:26:56.219 --> 00:26:57.137
Pardon?

00:26:57.762 --> 00:26:58.596
What do you like?

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.891
What's your taste in food, landscape,
jewelry, art and music?

00:27:01.975 --> 00:27:03.476
Which one do you want to start with?

00:27:04.727 --> 00:27:06.771
Where's the nearest tailor shop?

00:27:06.855 --> 00:27:08.022
We need to go there.

00:27:08.106 --> 00:27:09.899
Wait. Stop.

00:27:11.776 --> 00:27:13.778
You're joking, right?

00:27:14.237 --> 00:27:17.282
Do you think I'm shamelessly
clinging to you just to joke around?

00:27:18.116 --> 00:27:21.161
Am I the only one
who feels like this is all too sudden?

00:27:21.244 --> 00:27:22.287
I feel the same.

00:27:22.787 --> 00:27:23.997
This is

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.915
utterly insane.

00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:29.085
So I wasn't wrong

00:27:29.169 --> 00:27:31.087
on the first day we met.

00:27:31.171 --> 00:27:33.506
I guess we can say
I was a dullard after all.

00:27:34.048 --> 00:27:35.550
In case you forgot,

00:27:35.633 --> 00:27:36.718
I am

00:27:37.719 --> 00:27:39.095
loyal to my fiancé.

00:27:39.179 --> 00:27:40.513
But that scoundrel…

00:27:44.142 --> 00:27:46.853
Why is everyone making such a fuss
over this lowly girl?

00:27:49.022 --> 00:27:50.190
He's garbage.

00:27:51.483 --> 00:27:52.442
So full of himself.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.945
Are you the same person from yesterday?

00:27:56.696 --> 00:27:57.780
Or

00:27:57.864 --> 00:28:00.450
have you always been this stubborn?

00:28:01.242 --> 00:28:03.912
If I had really meant to be stubborn,
it would've been far worse.

00:28:03.995 --> 00:28:06.247
I didn't ask about your fiancé's family

00:28:06.331 --> 00:28:08.082
because I want to keep
the power I can wield

00:28:08.166 --> 00:28:10.168
as a last resort.

00:28:10.251 --> 00:28:11.836
I want to play fair,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.671
so I'm being as patient as possible

00:28:13.755 --> 00:28:16.090
and trying to change your mind.

00:28:20.595 --> 00:28:23.097
I just really don't get it.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.433
You haven't known me that long.

00:28:25.517 --> 00:28:27.268
How much longer do you need

00:28:27.352 --> 00:28:28.686
to understand me?

00:28:30.897 --> 00:28:32.273
No, forget it.

00:28:33.024 --> 00:28:34.692
I'd rather not understand.

00:28:35.485 --> 00:28:36.486
I'm going.

00:28:37.111 --> 00:28:38.279
Take care.

00:28:38.905 --> 00:28:40.323
Just be honest with me.

00:28:40.949 --> 00:28:43.159
You're avoiding me now.

00:28:47.455 --> 00:28:48.456
Because you're scared.

00:29:01.928 --> 00:29:03.263
I'm scared?

00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:06.015
What do you mean?

00:29:06.099 --> 00:29:07.141
You know what I mean.

00:29:10.937 --> 00:29:12.230
Let me make this clear.

00:29:12.647 --> 00:29:13.648
My fiancé and I--

00:29:13.731 --> 00:29:14.941
You don't love him.

00:29:16.943 --> 00:29:18.403
If you did,

00:29:18.486 --> 00:29:19.737
that night, you wouldn't have…

00:29:24.576 --> 00:29:27.912
I did consider playing along
with your lame excuse,

00:29:28.288 --> 00:29:31.624
honoring the line you drew,
giving up altogether.

00:29:31.708 --> 00:29:32.959
But I didn't want to.

00:29:35.837 --> 00:29:37.422
-So--
-Fine.

00:29:38.423 --> 00:29:39.799
I'll be honest with you.

00:29:42.302 --> 00:29:44.470
You're right. It was that night.

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.600
You know the kind of marriages
people of my class enter into in Joseon.

00:29:49.392 --> 00:29:51.227
I decided to do it that night.

00:29:55.064 --> 00:29:56.190
You see,

00:29:56.274 --> 00:29:59.027
wealth, success, fame,

00:29:59.569 --> 00:30:00.945
family, myself,

00:30:01.529 --> 00:30:04.115
of all the things
deemed important in this world,

00:30:04.198 --> 00:30:07.118
what mattered least to me

00:30:08.202 --> 00:30:09.704
was love.

00:30:10.663 --> 00:30:13.166
Then, the night I decided to get married,

00:30:13.249 --> 00:30:15.001
I asked myself for the first time.

00:30:16.336 --> 00:30:17.420
"What if

00:30:18.296 --> 00:30:20.965
I'm missing something important?"

00:30:22.342 --> 00:30:23.968
And that question

00:30:24.052 --> 00:30:25.762
made me anxious.

00:30:27.472 --> 00:30:30.433
Perhaps unhappy too.

00:30:33.895 --> 00:30:35.980
That's when I saw you.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:41.277
Looking at the man who had been
waiting for me for over four hours,

00:30:42.612 --> 00:30:43.821
I felt like

00:30:43.905 --> 00:30:46.991
I had stepped into an old folk tale.

00:30:49.577 --> 00:30:50.870
That's all.

00:30:52.956 --> 00:30:54.791
I ran from reality

00:30:55.959 --> 00:30:57.669
and ran to you.

00:30:59.712 --> 00:31:01.422
Blinded by my own self-pity,

00:31:02.173 --> 00:31:03.841
I poured out all my frustrations

00:31:05.093 --> 00:31:06.928
over my misfortune to a stranger.

00:31:16.896 --> 00:31:18.523
And now,

00:31:18.606 --> 00:31:20.525
I don't want to be held back
by some folk tale.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.110
That's a lie.

00:31:27.198 --> 00:31:28.574
Don't follow me.

00:31:40.253 --> 00:31:42.880
I'm the one who got dumped.
Why are you angry?

00:31:43.673 --> 00:31:45.383
I just need you to say one thing.

00:31:45.466 --> 00:31:48.136
That it's all right.

00:31:49.178 --> 00:31:52.056
Why does he care this much?

00:31:54.058 --> 00:31:55.518
I am not like my father.

00:31:55.601 --> 00:31:57.812
I would have slain
every living creature in your house

00:31:57.895 --> 00:32:00.064
on the very day of the literati purge
if I were him.

00:32:04.819 --> 00:32:06.529
I don't want to hurt him,

00:32:06.612 --> 00:32:07.947
but I must stay firm.

00:32:12.702 --> 00:32:13.953
I already gave you my answer.

00:32:14.579 --> 00:32:16.497
Does my low status

00:32:16.581 --> 00:32:18.541
make my rejection worthless too?

00:32:18.624 --> 00:32:20.418
That's not what I meant.

00:32:20.501 --> 00:32:22.003
Are you twisting my words on purpose?

00:32:22.086 --> 00:32:23.129
You see,

00:32:23.212 --> 00:32:25.882
I am not of a status

00:32:25.965 --> 00:32:27.592
that allows me to speak my mind

00:32:27.675 --> 00:32:30.261
and express my feelings so freely.

00:32:32.764 --> 00:32:35.391
I must endure,
keep everything hidden and reveal nothing

00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:38.895
because of my status.

00:32:40.229 --> 00:32:41.355
So

00:32:41.773 --> 00:32:43.399
I can't be swayed

00:32:44.275 --> 00:32:45.818
by momentary feelings.

00:32:50.615 --> 00:32:51.699
This is

00:32:52.784 --> 00:32:53.910
the difference

00:32:55.745 --> 00:32:57.622
between you and me.

00:33:03.419 --> 00:33:04.253
"Momentary"?

00:33:06.589 --> 00:33:07.840
You're right.

00:33:07.924 --> 00:33:10.927
As you said,
I grew up living in my own world.

00:33:11.886 --> 00:33:14.597
I admit that what I said
was an inconsiderate confession,

00:33:15.098 --> 00:33:17.308
driven by one-sided feelings.

00:33:17.934 --> 00:33:20.645
I never even thought about
the difference you are talking about.

00:33:21.395 --> 00:33:22.980
I didn't need to.

00:33:25.316 --> 00:33:26.901
I won't pretend to understand now.

00:33:26.984 --> 00:33:28.027
But you know what?

00:33:28.986 --> 00:33:30.279
Despite my status,

00:33:30.822 --> 00:33:34.033
it took me endless reflection
to stand before the woman I hold dear.

00:33:35.118 --> 00:33:37.703
I hesitated at every step on the way here.

00:33:39.038 --> 00:33:40.373
And most people

00:33:41.207 --> 00:33:42.667
call that courage.

00:33:45.253 --> 00:33:46.170
Too bad.

00:33:50.675 --> 00:33:51.551
I'm going now.

00:34:53.112 --> 00:34:54.113
Madam,

00:34:54.572 --> 00:34:55.740
I'm hungry.

00:34:55.823 --> 00:34:57.950
Wait here. I'll prepare some snacks.

00:34:58.034 --> 00:34:59.035
All right.

00:35:03.247 --> 00:35:05.750
You wench, just leave our family already.

00:35:06.167 --> 00:35:07.543
I'd rather…

00:35:09.253 --> 00:35:13.674
Eun-jo is marrying your grandfather?

00:35:13.758 --> 00:35:15.259
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:35:16.594 --> 00:35:18.054
What memory is this?

00:35:18.554 --> 00:35:20.973
You seem pretty happy,
for someone who is selling his sister

00:35:21.057 --> 00:35:22.266
to get by.

00:35:27.855 --> 00:35:30.149
Madam, when is Eun-jo's wedding again?

00:35:30.566 --> 00:35:32.318
In ten days.

00:35:32.944 --> 00:35:34.445
And when is Father leaving?

00:35:34.904 --> 00:35:36.239
In five days.

00:35:37.365 --> 00:35:39.867
Whatever. I don't care.

00:35:39.951 --> 00:35:41.786
This is not my concern.

00:35:42.954 --> 00:35:44.247
You wished to see me?

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.875
The marriage arrangement
will not be called off.

00:35:48.709 --> 00:35:51.212
They say husband and wife are of one mind,

00:35:51.295 --> 00:35:54.215
so I must reveal to my wife
who I truly am.

00:35:56.884 --> 00:35:59.428
This young lady
from a most esteemed noble house

00:35:59.512 --> 00:36:03.349
would be shattered to hear
she is to marry an animal.

00:36:06.644 --> 00:36:07.937
Even the concubine's daughter

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:12.024
would willingly become
an old man's concubine for her father.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.444
Why are you bringing her up?

00:36:15.528 --> 00:36:17.655
Learn from that girl, Eun-jo.

00:36:17.738 --> 00:36:19.991
So I should just shut my mouth
and let you sell me?

00:36:20.074 --> 00:36:20.992
Like that lowly wench?

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.289
Do you think

00:36:27.164 --> 00:36:31.502
refusing to become a breeding horse,
as you put it, will protect your pride?

00:36:31.585 --> 00:36:33.170
That girl, Eun-jo, knows

00:36:33.254 --> 00:36:36.299
that someone as lowly as her
is not given any choice.

00:36:36.674 --> 00:36:39.302
You cannot reveal who you are
to the Queen Consort's…

00:36:39.385 --> 00:36:42.013
No, to anyone else.

00:36:42.096 --> 00:36:44.807
Your name, your wealth, your honor…

00:36:45.933 --> 00:36:47.518
You cannot let go

00:36:50.438 --> 00:36:51.689
of any of that.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.608
That is what you are.

00:36:57.862 --> 00:36:59.405
I wish you a safe trip.

00:36:59.905 --> 00:37:03.326
I hear the land there is beautiful.
I hope you enjoy your time there.

00:37:04.702 --> 00:37:05.661
By the way…

00:37:10.333 --> 00:37:12.585
Why don't you wait until Eun-jo's wedding?

00:37:14.545 --> 00:37:17.715
Now you're the head of the family.

00:37:17.965 --> 00:37:20.426
Please take care of her in my stead.

00:37:20.509 --> 00:37:22.261
Why are you putting this on me?

00:37:22.345 --> 00:37:23.596
Look, you are now--

00:37:23.679 --> 00:37:24.930
Seriously!

00:37:26.057 --> 00:37:26.932
Hey!

00:37:27.141 --> 00:37:28.184
You have nothing to say?

00:37:31.645 --> 00:37:33.606
Whatever. It's your life!

00:37:36.525 --> 00:37:38.444
Even on my last day.

00:37:42.323 --> 00:37:43.491
I apologize.

00:37:44.075 --> 00:37:45.284
It's all right.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:49.997
Ask the innkeeper
to brew the medicinal herbs I gave you.

00:37:54.251 --> 00:37:57.588
I'm sorry
you have to attend the wedding alone.

00:38:00.049 --> 00:38:01.592
Do not worry.

00:38:02.301 --> 00:38:04.136
Just make sure to have a safe journey.

00:38:25.699 --> 00:38:27.535
Did you send for me?

00:38:29.954 --> 00:38:32.123
How's everything going?

00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:40.965
I cannot give you much time.

00:38:43.259 --> 00:38:44.635
Does His Majesty know

00:38:45.511 --> 00:38:50.349
what incense you brought
into his bedchamber?

00:38:55.813 --> 00:38:58.232
Does he know that breathing in the incense

00:38:58.941 --> 00:39:00.776
will cloud his mind,

00:39:01.527 --> 00:39:03.320
dull his judgment,

00:39:04.738 --> 00:39:05.990
and in the end,

00:39:06.073 --> 00:39:08.617
leave him no better than a corpse

00:39:09.243 --> 00:39:12.580
and your puppet to command?

00:39:16.959 --> 00:39:19.420
His Majesty thinks it's a pain reliever.

00:39:21.922 --> 00:39:25.801
Let me know when he starts
showing symptoms of addiction.

00:39:26.886 --> 00:39:28.053
Chief Secretary Im,

00:39:28.345 --> 00:39:31.348
is it this country that you covet?

00:39:32.183 --> 00:39:33.350
How dare you?

00:39:34.101 --> 00:39:36.395
Do you have no fear of consequences?

00:40:00.503 --> 00:40:03.088
So, he's been only fishing for days?

00:40:03.172 --> 00:40:05.549
Does His Highness want to be a fisherman?

00:40:05.633 --> 00:40:07.885
He could not have the woman he cared for,

00:40:07.968 --> 00:40:09.637
so he turned to fish instead.

00:40:09.929 --> 00:40:12.640
You're not talking behind my back.
You're just behind my back.

00:40:13.182 --> 00:40:15.851
If you want to talk behind my back,

00:40:16.185 --> 00:40:18.020
make sure I can't see or hear you.

00:40:18.646 --> 00:40:21.023
It's nagging in disguise.

00:40:21.106 --> 00:40:22.733
How long must this continue?

00:40:22.816 --> 00:40:24.401
I need to know.

00:40:24.485 --> 00:40:26.278
I'll let you know when I find out.

00:40:29.323 --> 00:40:32.451
Your Highness,
I'm here to report something to you.

00:40:32.785 --> 00:40:35.829
There's a rumor going around the market.

00:40:36.997 --> 00:40:37.831
What is it?

00:40:37.915 --> 00:40:40.834
That the ledger exposing
the Chief Censor's corruption was stolen

00:40:40.918 --> 00:40:42.253
by Gil-dong.

00:40:42.711 --> 00:40:44.630
That's not a rumor. That's a fact.

00:40:44.713 --> 00:40:47.466
That is exactly what baffles me.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.802
I thought only three of us knew it.

00:40:49.885 --> 00:40:51.387
There's one more person who knows.

00:40:52.513 --> 00:40:53.806
-Who?
-Who?

00:40:55.266 --> 00:40:56.892
Gil-dong.

00:40:57.977 --> 00:40:59.979
He was the kind of thief

00:41:00.062 --> 00:41:02.189
who wanted to hide
where he stole those items.

00:41:02.273 --> 00:41:05.484
Now that his theft is becoming known,
he may be seeking notoriety.

00:41:05.901 --> 00:41:06.944
Or perhaps,

00:41:07.027 --> 00:41:09.780
he was using you from the beginning.

00:41:12.324 --> 00:41:14.159
I must approach this
from a different angle.

00:41:14.243 --> 00:41:15.244
A different angle?

00:41:15.911 --> 00:41:17.204
Trace the source of the ledger.

00:41:17.788 --> 00:41:18.831
Of course.

00:41:18.914 --> 00:41:21.625
Tracing where it came from
will reveal how Gil-dong obtained it.

00:41:21.709 --> 00:41:23.836
The ledger recorded
the Chief Censor's corruption,

00:41:23.919 --> 00:41:24.920
so it is likely that

00:41:25.004 --> 00:41:27.506
the person who wrote it
was targeting the Chief Censor.

00:41:28.173 --> 00:41:29.883
Meet the Chief Censor and ask him.

00:41:29.967 --> 00:41:31.885
He's too bitter toward me
to speak with me.

00:41:39.602 --> 00:41:41.562
We're closed today.

00:41:42.104 --> 00:41:43.689
Come again another time.

00:41:43.772 --> 00:41:45.399
You're the kids from Gwangtong Bridge.

00:41:45.482 --> 00:41:46.400
Come here.

00:41:48.277 --> 00:41:49.987
Tomorrow is your wedding.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:52.197
Ask someone else to switch shifts
and get some rest.

00:41:52.281 --> 00:41:53.949
You've been strange these days.

00:41:54.366 --> 00:41:56.869
I'll take care of the rest.
You can go home now.

00:42:12.176 --> 00:42:13.927
When did you last eat?

00:42:18.807 --> 00:42:19.933
Oh, dear.

00:42:20.017 --> 00:42:23.562
If you kids were rice weevils,
we'd lose the harvest every year.

00:42:35.783 --> 00:42:38.327
Right now, I have nothing to offer.

00:42:40.913 --> 00:42:41.789
Would this be enough?

00:42:55.386 --> 00:42:56.679
Is it for me?

00:43:04.019 --> 00:43:05.604
How generous of you.

00:43:20.369 --> 00:43:21.662
It's pretty.

00:43:38.887 --> 00:43:40.013
Please accept this offering.

00:43:44.852 --> 00:43:46.520
You're pretty savvy for a young monk.

00:43:49.398 --> 00:43:51.900
This should be enough
to replace the temple's flooring.

00:44:09.543 --> 00:44:10.544
What about me?

00:44:11.253 --> 00:44:12.796
This bracelet's for the generous ones.

00:44:13.088 --> 00:44:14.590
You only offered one nyang.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.218
Kids these days don't even answer.

00:44:18.552 --> 00:44:20.429
He was on a silent retreat.

00:44:39.281 --> 00:44:40.824
Why does it have to rain today?

00:44:49.958 --> 00:44:52.294
Your Highness, you might catch a cold.

00:44:53.629 --> 00:44:54.922
Will it rain until tomorrow?

00:44:58.175 --> 00:44:59.718
It looks that way.

00:45:07.726 --> 00:45:08.810
Your Highness,

00:45:09.269 --> 00:45:10.646
what are you looking at?

00:45:12.856 --> 00:45:14.149
The muddy water.

00:45:47.224 --> 00:45:49.810
Why does it have to rain
on her wedding day?

00:45:52.604 --> 00:45:55.607
Even the sky is being petty.

00:45:59.695 --> 00:46:01.780
It stopped raining early this morning.

00:46:05.033 --> 00:46:06.702
Do you think it'll continue to rain?

00:46:08.787 --> 00:46:10.080
Blast it.

00:46:10.998 --> 00:46:12.833
What? What's the matter?

00:46:13.667 --> 00:46:15.335
Why do you have to be so pretty?

00:46:15.419 --> 00:46:17.462
You're too pretty to be anyone's wife.

00:46:18.422 --> 00:46:19.381
What?

00:46:19.881 --> 00:46:20.924
Hey!

00:46:21.592 --> 00:46:23.093
You can't be this pretty!

00:46:23.176 --> 00:46:25.012
What am I supposed to do now?

00:46:27.931 --> 00:46:28.932
Madam!

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.892
Come out!

00:46:36.773 --> 00:46:39.818
Don't even think about
calling off this wedding.

00:46:41.028 --> 00:46:42.779
I want to live well now,

00:46:42.863 --> 00:46:44.531
as a concubine in a powerful family.

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.908
With a man in his 70s

00:46:47.534 --> 00:46:48.869
who could die any time?

00:46:48.952 --> 00:46:50.078
I'm actually lucky.

00:46:50.621 --> 00:46:53.498
He will lie quietly until he passes away.

00:46:54.124 --> 00:46:55.876
I don't need to cater to him

00:46:55.959 --> 00:46:57.544
or help him walk.

00:46:57.628 --> 00:46:58.962
And then?

00:47:00.005 --> 00:47:02.174
Will you live as a widow
for the rest of your life?

00:47:02.924 --> 00:47:04.551
Never receiving love from anyone?

00:47:08.639 --> 00:47:09.848
Does it matter?

00:47:09.931 --> 00:47:12.142
Can love feed you? Buy you a house?

00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:14.436
It only stirs up your heart

00:47:14.519 --> 00:47:15.771
and turns your stomach.

00:47:16.355 --> 00:47:18.315
It keeps me upset and on edge all day.

00:47:19.399 --> 00:47:20.817
I don't want that. I won't do that.

00:47:22.027 --> 00:47:23.028
Enough!

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:25.322
The lord will…

00:47:25.947 --> 00:47:26.990
No.

00:47:27.824 --> 00:47:29.242
I can't let you do this.

00:47:29.826 --> 00:47:31.119
Call off the wedding now.

00:47:33.038 --> 00:47:34.414
And then what?

00:47:34.498 --> 00:47:36.875
Where will you live
after getting kicked out of this house?

00:47:38.126 --> 00:47:40.003
Then who bears all the burdens?

00:47:40.587 --> 00:47:42.005
My sick mother?

00:47:42.089 --> 00:47:43.215
Young Master?

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.263
Do you really want me to struggle alone

00:47:50.347 --> 00:47:52.557
in that dark pit again?

00:47:53.225 --> 00:47:55.143
Don't you think that's too cruel?

00:48:07.948 --> 00:48:09.032
Let me go in peace.

00:48:22.963 --> 00:48:24.464
It's my fault.

00:48:26.174 --> 00:48:27.634
This is all my fault.

00:48:29.761 --> 00:48:31.054
I'm sorry.

00:48:33.306 --> 00:48:35.767
Eun-jo, I'm sorry.

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:41.815
I'm sorry too.

00:48:43.692 --> 00:48:45.277
Eun-jo…

00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:01.209
What brings you here?

00:49:01.293 --> 00:49:05.297
Forgive me. I know it is disrespectful
for a stranger to summon an unwed lady.

00:49:05.964 --> 00:49:07.674
Please come inside.

00:49:07.758 --> 00:49:10.385
You're my fiancé, not a stranger.

00:49:10.469 --> 00:49:12.304
Soon I will be.

00:49:13.513 --> 00:49:15.098
We're ending our betrothal.

00:49:19.144 --> 00:49:21.605
I don't understand.

00:49:26.359 --> 00:49:27.402
The reason for ending it…

00:49:29.905 --> 00:49:33.700
Do you think refusing to become
a breeding horse will protect your pride?

00:49:36.161 --> 00:49:36.995
The reason is…

00:49:37.078 --> 00:49:37.996
Your name,

00:49:38.497 --> 00:49:40.457
your wealth, your honor…

00:49:41.166 --> 00:49:42.626
You cannot let go

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.294
of any of that.

00:49:45.086 --> 00:49:47.088
That is what you are.

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:54.679
What a cowardly wretch.

00:49:59.059 --> 00:50:01.812
If it's because of your love for No-eul,
the courtesan,

00:50:02.312 --> 00:50:03.522
I'm fine with it.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.234
If you keep saying you're fine,

00:50:07.317 --> 00:50:09.611
you will have to endure something
you cannot be fine with.

00:50:13.949 --> 00:50:15.200
The bride must call it off,

00:50:15.283 --> 00:50:17.494
so she may be spared the consequences.

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:21.331
Wait.

00:50:26.795 --> 00:50:29.005
You came all this way through the rain.

00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:31.716
Does that mean it was a rushed decision?

00:50:35.053 --> 00:50:36.847
Let us call it a fight for survival.

00:50:43.019 --> 00:50:46.022
The rain seems to be getting heavier.
Let's get going.

00:50:46.398 --> 00:50:47.399
Yes.

00:50:51.778 --> 00:50:52.779
What is this?

00:50:52.863 --> 00:50:54.072
They're silk shoes.

00:50:56.533 --> 00:50:59.411
I said I wouldn't wear silk shoes.
They'll get all muddy.

00:51:05.208 --> 00:51:07.502
They're not my silk shoes.

00:51:15.844 --> 00:51:19.014
Some young man left them there
with the silk shoes.

00:51:19.347 --> 00:51:22.225
He must've been worried that
you'd wear wet shoes on your wedding day.

00:51:25.937 --> 00:51:27.272
It can't be…

00:51:45.081 --> 00:51:46.583
Being in the rain,

00:51:46.666 --> 00:51:50.253
it feels as though
all your sorrow is washed away.

00:51:51.504 --> 00:51:52.672
I don't believe you.

00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:56.134
It really does.

00:52:09.981 --> 00:52:11.191
I don't believe you.

00:52:52.732 --> 00:52:54.150
That girl, Eun-jo, knows

00:52:54.234 --> 00:52:57.153
that someone as lowly as her
is not given any choice.

00:52:57.612 --> 00:52:59.114
You really had to…

00:53:21.094 --> 00:53:22.262
What are you doing?

00:53:25.598 --> 00:53:26.433
What are you--

00:53:26.516 --> 00:53:28.059
I'm treating you like an animal.

00:53:28.143 --> 00:53:29.519
You don't deserve this luxury.

00:53:37.819 --> 00:53:39.446
Do you want to be sold that badly?

00:54:03.636 --> 00:54:06.723
My lord!

00:54:20.653 --> 00:54:22.697
The Master

00:54:22.781 --> 00:54:24.532
has passed away!

00:54:36.961 --> 00:54:38.505
I'm an aide from the constabulary.

00:54:38.588 --> 00:54:40.048
Take me to the prisoner.

00:54:45.762 --> 00:54:47.764
What? What's the matter?

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:50.391
Call the soldiers.

00:54:50.475 --> 00:54:51.810
-Now!
-Yes, sir.

00:55:01.194 --> 00:55:03.321
GIL-DONG

00:55:03.404 --> 00:55:04.614
Gil-dong?

00:55:20.672 --> 00:55:21.506
Your Highness.

00:55:24.467 --> 00:55:26.177
-What is it?
-It's liquor.

00:55:26.636 --> 00:55:28.388
You look like you need some tonight.

00:55:36.938 --> 00:55:38.148
Eun-jo.

00:55:44.654 --> 00:55:46.072
Seok-sam?

00:55:47.866 --> 00:55:49.951
You haven't eaten anything all day,
have you?

00:55:50.034 --> 00:55:50.994
Here.

00:55:51.494 --> 00:55:52.579
Have some.

00:55:58.793 --> 00:56:01.254
How did you get here?

00:56:01.671 --> 00:56:03.882
I was sold, of course.

00:56:03.965 --> 00:56:06.176
We belong to our masters.

00:56:06.259 --> 00:56:09.470
Since my master's family has fallen,
all his property has been confiscated.

00:56:09.554 --> 00:56:11.598
Then I was sold
to this household yesterday.

00:56:12.432 --> 00:56:13.641
I see.

00:56:15.059 --> 00:56:18.354
Will the Chief Censor be exiled soon?

00:56:20.899 --> 00:56:22.650
That man's no longer living.

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:27.197
Are you saying he passed away?

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:28.406
All of a sudden?

00:56:28.823 --> 00:56:30.491
I can't believe it either.

00:56:30.992 --> 00:56:34.162
What's even more unbelievable
is the rumor that is going around.

00:56:35.288 --> 00:56:36.331
What rumor?

00:56:39.709 --> 00:56:41.753
That my master

00:56:41.836 --> 00:56:43.338
was killed by Gil-dong.

00:56:44.797 --> 00:56:47.300
What? Gil-dong?

00:56:50.678 --> 00:56:52.388
Gil-dong is a murderer?

00:56:52.722 --> 00:56:54.098
What's this…

00:56:59.395 --> 00:57:03.191
No one will come to the annex tonight, so…

00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:08.821
Are you chasing Gil-dong now?

00:57:08.905 --> 00:57:10.114
We're investigating the case.

00:57:10.406 --> 00:57:12.450
Investigating what?

00:57:12.742 --> 00:57:14.827
My husband wrote

00:57:14.911 --> 00:57:18.414
the name "Gil-dong" in blood!

00:57:18.957 --> 00:57:19.916
In blood?

00:57:20.375 --> 00:57:21.960
Did he leave a will?

00:57:22.043 --> 00:57:24.045
Please wait a little longer

00:57:24.128 --> 00:57:25.672
until we find conclusive evidence.

00:57:30.051 --> 00:57:31.970
We haven't found any evidence.

00:57:32.053 --> 00:57:33.304
Let's go to the constabulary.

00:57:33.846 --> 00:57:34.722
Let's go.

00:57:34.806 --> 00:57:35.807
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:57:47.402 --> 00:57:48.695
It's Gil-dong!

00:57:48.778 --> 00:57:50.363
Gil-dong is here!

00:57:51.197 --> 00:57:52.740
Gil-dong is here!

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:54.784
Gil-dong?

00:57:54.867 --> 00:57:55.994
Did he say "Gil-dong"?

00:57:56.077 --> 00:57:57.161
That way!

00:59:03.686 --> 00:59:05.438
I must get up.

01:00:00.451 --> 01:00:02.245
How long have I been here?

01:00:02.704 --> 01:00:04.455
Drinks and snacks?

01:00:06.082 --> 01:00:08.418
I was being chased by soldiers.

01:00:10.044 --> 01:00:11.462
What? Silk clothes?

01:00:11.546 --> 01:00:12.547
Wait.

01:00:13.256 --> 01:00:14.382
What happened to my hands?

01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:24.350
Why am I so dizzy?

01:00:25.268 --> 01:00:26.310
What happened?

01:00:27.061 --> 01:00:28.229
Why am I in the market?

01:00:28.312 --> 01:00:30.064
Gil-dong is here!

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.066
Find Gil-dong!

01:00:32.775 --> 01:00:33.693
Gil-dong?

01:00:35.945 --> 01:00:36.988
What?

01:00:45.288 --> 01:00:46.330
This face…

01:00:48.666 --> 01:00:49.584
What?

01:00:50.418 --> 01:00:51.502
It's the aide.

01:01:28.623 --> 01:01:29.457
Anybody here?

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:30.958
Are you there?

01:01:31.042 --> 01:01:33.961
Are our souls really switched?

01:01:34.045 --> 01:01:36.255
Palace? I'm in the royal palace?

01:01:36.339 --> 01:01:37.215
Dignity.

01:01:37.298 --> 01:01:39.217
Since yesterday,
this has been my home.

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.345
Did you have a fight
with your wife last night?

01:01:42.428 --> 01:01:43.638
Are you calling me husband?

01:01:44.514 --> 01:01:48.476
I'm mad at myself
for giving you the silk shoes.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.645
I didn't hear any cough so I checked,

01:01:50.728 --> 01:01:52.230
and he was already gone.

01:01:52.313 --> 01:01:53.147
Gil-dong's arrested?

01:01:53.773 --> 01:01:55.233
Find His Highness!

01:01:56.025 --> 01:01:58.152
