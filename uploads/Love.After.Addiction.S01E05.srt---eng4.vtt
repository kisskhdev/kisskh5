"Love After Addiction"

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600
(Episode 5)

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.879
Yoki, where are you going?

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.879
To make you trust me.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.879
Alright, alright.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.319
Alright, I trust you, OK?

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.879
You trust me now?

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.280
Then take a sip.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.840
Does it taste good?

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:55.599
It's good.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.080
Now tell me about yourself.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.359
A college student from the city,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.000
why would you want to be a volunteer

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.240
in this small fishing village?

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:09.759
Me?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.759
At first,

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.119
I just wanted to escape my dad

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.520
and find a place to catch my breath.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.479
Then I came here—Lanwan Village.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.439
Every wisp of sea breeze here

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:22.599
and every tide...

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.760
I think this place is really worth
being discovered by more people.

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:28.560
You joining the show

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.319
is for the same reason too?

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.280
Yang Meng.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.240
Count me in!

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.319
I'll join you.

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.240
Want to get on the boat?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Get on the bed?

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.680
Here?

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:20.039
Isn't...

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.199
Isn't it right here?

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.800
He just grilled fish for me.

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.159
And now he's making me work.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.639
What kind of person is he?

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.519
He changes faces
faster than turning a page.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.159
I'm not your coolie!

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:38.879
No way.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.840
I need to relax.

00:03:56.193 --> 00:03:58.345
(Miscelaneous gay
flirting leading to a hookup)

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360
So close!

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.519
No way...!

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:36.519
Surprised?

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.519
What happened to them now?

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.000
The liking is real.

00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:59.279
And the physical attraction

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.120
is real too.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.720
What should I do?

00:07:52.376 --> 00:07:53.816
(A string of voice notes from "Dad")

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:56.920
Li Mei from your village
sent me a message.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.480
She said there's some
problematic celebrity...

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.120
Brother Meng

00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:00.319
I want breakfast.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.720
You promised to come back this month.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.160
Are you going to break your promise?

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.120
What exactly is in that village?

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:19.079
I already found a job for you.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.735
If you don't come back within a month,

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:21.839
I'll come there to get you.

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:24.600
You're a man.

00:08:24.601 --> 00:08:26.279
So we should communicate like men.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Dad,

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:31.519
I have my own dreams.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.080
I want to...

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.840
Study hard and get into a good university!

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.280
Then find a good job
that matches your major!

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.360
Dad.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.280
After graduating from
university, I want to...

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Brother Meng.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.159
What's for breakfast?

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.720
Make it yourself.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.360
I'm busy.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.440
What's wrong with you now?

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.360
You won't even make me food!

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:13.639
I'm starving, I'm starving.

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:18.000
Starving me to death, starving me to death.

00:09:35.587 --> 00:09:36.786
What's this?

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.159
Why is this here?

00:09:40.184 --> 00:09:42.024
[Unhinged fan text

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:19.399
Five minutes and twenty-four seconds.

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:21.639
And this one...

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.440
is our professional islander.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.000
Since he was a kid,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.679
he's been messing around in these waters.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.519
He has very solid

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.960
water skills.

00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:33.679
What about our guests?

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.159
Is there anyone

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.520
who wants to compete with him?

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.720
The winner

00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:39.480
will get extra monetary support.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.920
The more people you defeat,

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:43.080
the more survival funds

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.240
you'll get.

00:11:44.919 --> 00:11:46.639
Which guest wants to take the challenge?

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:57.679
If no one does,

00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:02.039
then I'll do it!

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.600
So masculine!

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.759
No wonder he's famous—it's inevitable!

00:12:17.799 --> 00:12:18.440
I'm afraid something bad

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.440

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.360
Brother Yoki,

00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:48.359
Don't let anything bad happen!

I really don't understand.

This big fool!

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.240
Actually, last night...

Let's go, Brother Yang, let's take a bath!

What's up?

00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:09.360
It's none of your business.

00:14:09.559 --> 00:14:10.559
Get lost!

I have training later.

00:14:24.679 --> 00:14:25.679
Go in first.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.120

Yes.

But dressed like this...

00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:24.440
isn't it a bit inappropriate?

I like you so much!

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.919

Brother Yang!

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.759
I have to take some photos

00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:31.879
to show to my Uncle Yang

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.960

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:33.799
Yes, yes.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.840
Just kill me today!

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.079
If my dad finds out I'm dressed like this,

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:36.840
he'll beat me to death!

00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:37.879
Just teasing you!

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.159
I'll keep them for myself.

00:16:40.679 --> 00:16:41.799
Isn't it really nice?

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.719
Yes, yes! It's nice!

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.758
Is our village's Flower Fairy beautiful?

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:45.799
Beautiful!

00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:47.200
Turn around for everyone to see!

00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:48.999
Just turn around.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.600
Turn around.

Turn around, turn around, turn around.

Say something!

00:18:00.119 --> 00:18:01.479
That old man couldn't fit into it.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.039
He begged me to come help.

00:18:04.119 --> 00:18:04.680
One hundred!

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.519
No!

Still no!

Ten thousand!

00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:11.079
I'm not buying it.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.040
You're the little flower boy!

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:18.119
But I remember...

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:18.839
that old man's figure

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.120
isn't even as good as yours!

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.160
You mean...

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.359
my figure is good?

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.640
Narcissist!

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:32.319
Then do you think...

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.880
I'm handsome?

00:18:35.519 --> 00:18:36.519
No.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.720
Tell the truth!

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.680
Do I look good?

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.440
No.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.960
But I think...

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.160
you look really nice today!
