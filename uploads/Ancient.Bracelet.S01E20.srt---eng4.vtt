00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.510
Che,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.840
let's go.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.270
No.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.670
Zhaoli belongs to me.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.030
Yan Che, don't forget

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.040
that I've issued the decree.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.040
She is no longer your wife.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.870
Whether she's my wife or not

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.400
is up to Zhaoli.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.480
(Ying Du,)

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.070
(you've always been protecting me.)

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.840
(This time,)

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.400
(let me do something for you.)

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.960
Ying Du,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.590
didn't you see?

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.040
If Che hadn't arrived in time just now,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.975
Ye Li, who fancies you,

00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:35.040
would've skinned me alive,

00:01:35.224 --> 00:01:36.373
and my flesh would've rotted.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.230
Every moment we've spent together

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.120
has been filled with pain.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.000
Let's not meet again.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.760
Che,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.320
let's go.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.240
Zhaoli.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.240
Zhaoli!

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.800
Look, your clothes are all soaked.

00:02:26.978 --> 00:02:28.127
Go change into something dry.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.430
I'm a little tired.

00:02:36.346 --> 00:02:37.480
I want to change my clothes.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.400
I'll rest for a while.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.190
Che, you scared me.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.710
Did he do this?

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.550
I...

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.360
Yan Che.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.280
Yan Che, let me go!

00:03:00.386 --> 00:03:01.910
- Let me go!
- Whatever he did to you,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.280
I'll do the same.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.000
Why did you abandon me as well?

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.680
Calm yourself.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.080
Whatever he has, I must have too.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.710
Let go, Yan Che!

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.840
Have you lost your mind?

00:03:13.907 --> 00:03:15.817
Today, I'll teach you
a few self-defense moves.

00:03:15.887 --> 00:03:17.059
For times when I'm not around,

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.450
they'll be enough to keep you safe.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.120
How dare you wound me!

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.750
Zhaoli,

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.360
do you know how deeply

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.680
I've missed you during this time?

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.310
I can overlook

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.190
whatever happened these days.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.030
As long as your heart remains with me,

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.590
I can accept anything.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.280
(Now,)

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.800
(only by killing him)

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.560
(can Ying Du survive.)

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.150
(I can't sway her with feelings.)

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.840
(I'll have to use Oracle's method.)

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.750
You're not Che at all.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.190
You've killed

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.510
the real Che.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.470
Mr. Yan,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.720
the ruler has passed.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.720
Mr. Yan!

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.500
(Everlasting Joy)

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.910
Ying Du.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.880
Ying Du.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.560
Why?

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.240
Why did this happen?

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.120
Why has it come to this?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.430
Why?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.000
Ye Li,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.270
wasn't his wound healed?

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.390
Why has Ying Du become like this?

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.190
How dare you confront me?

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.190
If not for you,

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.520
he'd never wear himself down

00:05:03.531 --> 00:05:05.270
again and again.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.040
You're the one responsible
for his downfall.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.670
No.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.710
That's not true.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.920
There must be a way.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.950
There must be a way.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.000
There must be.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.960
Oracle.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.800
Oracle, where are you?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.180
(Oracle)

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.150
Zhaoli,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.310
you've finally come.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.040
Oracle,

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.680
how can I save one
on the brink of death?

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.040
I knew this trial awaited you.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.800
But if you wish to overcome it,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.750
only one can survive this fate.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.430
I urge you to think for yourself.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.960
No.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.310
I beg you; please save him.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.750
No matter what it takes.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.390
Oracle, I'm begging you.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.160
Please, stand up first.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.080
No.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.750
I'm begging you.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.390
Please, I need your help.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.310
If you truly want to save him,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.430
it must be life for life.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.640
Zhaoli,

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.800
are you truly willing

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.310
to offer your heart's blood?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.400
I am willing.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.000
I am willing.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.190
Thank you, Oracle.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.430
I can't let you die like this.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.160
I will trade my life

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.480
for yours.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.480
Mr. Yan,

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.800
with her heart's blood,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.800
not only will your wounds heal,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.000
but your power will grow greatly.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.390
Thanks to your brilliant plan,

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.430
I could so easily trap her

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.070
in the Illusion Realm

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.330
and make her willingly offer
her heart's blood.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.830
(Never thought she would go)

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.270
(to such lengths for Ying Du.)

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.480
But you must not let her know

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.360
she is inside the Illusion Realm,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.800
or the realm will shatter.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.240
Then the consciousness of you

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.040
could be trapped within.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.270
It's fine.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.750
Zhaoli is focused on saving her lover;

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.120
she can't think of anything else.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.840
It's you I'm concerned with.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.750
If I can command you,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.510
others can just as easily use you too.

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.550
Your usefulness ends here.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.220
(Everlasting Joy)

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.920
Your Majesty,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.920
you're awake.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.440
If you go looking for her like this,

00:08:59.749 --> 00:09:00.963
something terrible will happen.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.750
So, you already know everything.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.590
Ye Li,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.550
you know Yan Che stands against me.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.790
Why do you keep joining forces with him?

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.130
I...

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.630
I was forced by him.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.120
I had no choice.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.270
What exactly is he planning?

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.960
He created an Illusory Realm,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.960
making Wu Zhaoli believe

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.750
that you were already dead.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.510
He then lured her

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.440
to offer her heart's blood

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.750
to mend his wounds
and restore his power.

00:09:36.512 --> 00:09:37.466
What did you just say?
