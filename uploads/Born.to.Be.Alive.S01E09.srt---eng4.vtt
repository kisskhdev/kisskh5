[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.170
[Episode 9]

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.090
Don't move!

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.970
What are you doing?

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.400
Officer,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.610
it's freezing.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.970
Can we have a blanket?

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.050
Bear with it.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.340
Once you're in the detention center,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.740
you'll feel warm enough.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.010
Shao,

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.550
go get some sleep.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.000
Don't shout.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.570
Or I'll shoot him.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.920
If you shoot,

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.880
you won't get away.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.870
Go.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.890
Take his gun.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.490
Don't move.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.120
I don't want any trouble.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.600
Let us go.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.060
Fine.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.270
Let him go.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.580
Stop!

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.380
Stop chasing. Go check on Bai Ju.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.830
Captain!

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.360
Captain!

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.310
Captain!

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.770
Captain!

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.300
Captain!

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.930
Captain!

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.370
Captain!

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.890
Captain!

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.420
Captain!

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.070
Captain!

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.909
Bai Ju has reported it to the bureau.

00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:52.640
Checkpoints are being set up
on all major routes.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:07.220
Captain.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.330
Lower your voice.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:08.860
How is he?

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.180
We have to wait for the scans to come out.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:10.860
Excuse me.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:11.280
Make way.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.140
Make way.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.050
Step aside!

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.640
What are you doing?

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.600
That's too much!

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:21.280
Yes.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.570
That's the situation.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:22.920
Mom.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.580
-Intracranial hemorrhage is confirmed.
-How is Captain?

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.620
We're waiting for the scans.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.020
We need to take a look

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.040
and see exactly
how much bleeding there is.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.360
Yes.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.370
I'm waiting for Duojie's family.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.490
On our end,
we'll proceed with standard treatment

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.250
and be ready to transfer him at any time.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.530
Okay. Thanks, Liu Sen.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.140
Please arrange for his admission.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.799
Mom, is Captain in danger?

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.510
It's hard to say.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.820
We might need to transfer him
to the city-level hospital.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.240
We can't do

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.390
a craniotomy here.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:45.860
Then what are we waiting for?

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.390
Let's transfer him now.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.050
Both a transfer and surgery

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.450
require family consent.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.040
I'm waiting for Cairen, too.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.790
I'm anxious as well.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:51.620
I'll go find her.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.340
Don't go.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.620
Where are you going?

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.340
I'm going to find her.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.250
County Mayor Lin has
already gone to pick her up.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.240
How did Duojie get hurt?

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.000
Tell me again.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.570
It was

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.800
total chaos just now.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.510
Director Zhang.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.880
The scan results are in.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:13.690
Come on, hurry up.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:14.030
Okay.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.840
This way.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.080
Duojie!

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.400
Duojie...

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:43.510
How is he?

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.620
After the examination,

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.460
we found a small amount
of intracranial bleeding.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.270
We administered mannitol

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.600
to reduce the hematoma.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.470
But

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.190
whether the bleeding can be absorbed

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.650
still needs observation.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.160
What if it gets worse?

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.560
If it gets worse,

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.390
we must send him
to the city-level hospital immediately.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.630
I've already contacted them.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.900
They can perform surgical drainage.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.800
Then send him there now.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.440
What are you waiting for?

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.810
Send him to the city-level hospital
right away!

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:05.650
It takes eight hours

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.050
to get to the city.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.610
And the roads are bad,

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.770
so bumps are unavoidable.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:10.510
We can't worry about that now.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.640
Time is everything.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:12.490
Ms. Cairen.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.460
Ms. Cairen.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.130
We need to send him

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.420
to the city-level hospital

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.700
right now.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:21.720
No.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.290
No.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.200
Even if he dies,

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.860
he must die at home.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.490
He cannot die away from home.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.960
Absolutely not.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.050
Duojie will blame me.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.620
Ms. Cairen,

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.470
listen to me.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.380
Listen to me.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.150
You know

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.410
our county hospital's

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:38.860
equipment

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.100
and surgical capabilities

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.370
are limited.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.790
And Duojie has a hematoma

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:43.520
in his brain.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.550
If he stays here

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.870
and his condition worsens,

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.330
his life will be in danger.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.820
Given the situation,
we need to transfer Duojie

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.280
to a city-level hospital.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.600
We

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.940
respect

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.360
Tibetan customs very much,

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.090
but please believe in medicine

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.070
and science.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.670
The most important thing right now

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.580
is Duojie's

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.340
safety.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:04.220
Director Zhang!

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:04.870
Don't do this.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:05.730
Stand up first.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:06.480
Please stand up.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.620
We absolutely cannot let Duojie

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.680
die away from home.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.550
I beg you, Director Zhang.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.120
I beg you.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.840
Cairen.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:13.740
I beg you.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.290
Cairen.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:15.990
As long as you don't agree,

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.320
no one can send him away.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.030
Lin.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.820
Let him stay here.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.420
I will try my best.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.700
Okay.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.510
Ms. Cairen, we will listen to you.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.560
All right.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.860
Duojie is in good physical condition.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.580
If he absorbs the hematoma quickly,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.700
he will recover.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:44.620
Thank you.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.580
Thank you.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:50.970
Secretary Chen has gone
to the countryside.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.100
He is on his way back.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.270
If there are any problems,

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.460
call me anytime.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.290
Okay.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.390
Director Zhang,

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.010
how is Captain?

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.270
Can we go in and see him?

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.250
Yes,

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.830
but not too many at once.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:02.840
Okay.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:04.860
I'll go in first.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.120
You guys wait for a bit.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.020
County Mayor Lin.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.210
Come out with me for a moment.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:47.640
Reporter Shao,

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.570
do you think this was appropriate?

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:51.430
You stayed with the Mountain Patrol

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.760
and didn't even tell me?

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.100
Do you have any idea

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.150
how dangerous the Uninhabited Zone is?

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.080
Do you even know?

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.110
You are a reporter
from the provincial newspaper.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.710
You were acting recklessly.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.180
If something happens to you

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.370
like Comrade Duojie,

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.100
how will the county explain it?

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.030
How will we explain it to your newspaper?

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.160
How will we explain it to your parents?

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.530
It's one thing not to help,

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.950
but can you please not cause trouble?

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.320
This is nonsense, kid.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:19.320
Take care.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.370
Hurry up.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.430
I want to go in and see him.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:05.560
You are not allowed.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.300
Just one look.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.540
Not even a glance.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.130
It's your fault Captain is hurt.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:13.600
He.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.200
Isn't that

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.930
what you all think in your mind?

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:19.590
That boss

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.890
was the murderer who killed Dongzhiba.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.470
It was you who stopped us

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.160
and insisted on capturing him alive.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.020
How did you watch him by yourself?

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.130
How did he escape?

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.550
Explain it to me clearly!

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.250
And you still have the nerve to visit him?

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:33.960
Get lost!

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.150
Is that

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.400
what you all think?

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.670
I see.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.510
Good.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.370
Now,

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.720
go back to being a police officer.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.200
Get out of the Mountain Patrol!

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.130
Are you even men?

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.930
Something this big happens,

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.660
and everyone blames her alone?

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.550
Yes.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.220
The suspect escaped. It's on her.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.160
But was she wrong
to stop you from acting recklessly?

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:35.880
She's a cop!

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:36.990
I haven't dealt with you yet.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:37.490
Shut up.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.670
Who goes wandering off alone

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:39.600
in the middle of the night?

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.390
You're picking on me again.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:40.960
Stop it.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:42.340
If Captain hadn't tried to save you,

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.800
would he have gotten hurt?

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.820
You get lost, too.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:47.620
What kind of deputy captain are you?

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.240
You dare hit my sister?

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.650
Try hitting her again!

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.370
What kind of deputy captain are you?

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.340
Deputy captain, my ass.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.050
Without Duojie,

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.390
you can't even think straight.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:55.870
Thug!

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.540
Stop fighting, all of you!

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.290
Get out, everyone!

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.140
Things were already heated.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.260
Why did you have to interfere?

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.200
You were asking for a beating.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.160
Was I wrong?

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.830
Whether it's right or wrong,

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:28.260
it's not

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.150
for an outsider like you to judge.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.060
Now... now...

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.460
Now I'm an outsider?

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.320
I just couldn't stand it anyway.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.530
He Qingyuan

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.720
was completely unreasonable.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.360
Now is not

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.500
the time to reason.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.020
They...

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.030
And you—

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.380
What does this have to do with you anyway?

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.640
Why were you meddling?

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:56.420
Look.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:57.980
She's been like this since she was little.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.060
She snaps at whoever helps her.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.260
Totally ungrateful.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:05.160
Hello,

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:05.810
I'm Bai Ji.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:07.369
Hello.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.940
I'm Shao Yunfei.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:10.980
Bai Ji.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.099
Go cook.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.619
Cook at this hour?

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.630
That's a lot of meat.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:19.640
Cook it all.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.089
Cook it all?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:23.829
For them?

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.220
You don't know

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.420
how they treated Ju.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.260
Cook for them? I won't.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.590
Stop talking nonsense.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.260
Go cook.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.270
I'll help out, Auntie.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.500
Mom.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.530
Can I still stay

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:13.900
in the Mountain Patrol?

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.450
Don't think about that now.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.680
Duojie transferred you there.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.350
You can only leave if he says so.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:26.900
No one else has a say.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:31.960
But Duojie...

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.900
Will he wake up?

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.070
Do you know what Duojie means

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.650
in Tibetan?

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:46.920
No.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.310
Duojie means

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:54.760
"Vajra."

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.020
Something that can't be smashed,

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.070
can't be burned—

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.770
always strong,

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.230
impossible to destroy.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:07.420
I've known him for a long time.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.710
He's not someone

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.170
who goes down that easily.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:17.700
That doesn't sound like something

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.220
a doctor would say.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.170
Right now, I'm your mother.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.030
It's too dry. Is there water?

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.840
The water hasn't boiled yet.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.340
Zhacuo.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.400
You were too impulsive just now.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.220
We can't blame this all on Bai Ju.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.350
If not her, then who?

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.500
Reporter Shao was right.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.560
You just go around blaming everyone.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.500
When Captain got hurt,

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.430
where were we?

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:16.230
Besides,

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:17.250
whether Bai Ju leaves

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:17.920
will be decided

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.250
after Captain wakes up.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.760
Will he ever wake up?

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.130
A Deputy County Mayor

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.220
and County Party Standing Committee member

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:45.870
was seriously wounded by poachers

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.830
in the Uninhabited Zone.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.350
A provincial newspaper reporter

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.750
traveling with him

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:52.590
was nearly shot dead as well.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:54.980
I've been on the job

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.240
for over twenty years.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.400
I never imagined

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:58.910
there could be a bigger mess

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:00.020
than this.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:03.720
Chief Shi.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.900
What's your plan?

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.010
We've already

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.040
set up checkpoints

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.550
along the Qinghai–Tibet Highway.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:16.090
Right now, the bureau

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:16.870
is organizing a team,

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.530
rushing to procure supplies,

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.560
and preparing
to enter the mountains immediately

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.460
to hunt down the perpetrators.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.220
How?

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.640
Where?

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.110
This is something

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.180
we'd like

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.800
to submit for your approval.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.580
Our officers aren't very familiar

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:42.820
with the Uninhabited Zone.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.050
We want to pull some people
from the Mountain Patrol

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.090
to act as guides.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:48.830
What do you think?

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:49.740
Agreed.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:52.900
Okay.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.240
I'll arrange it immediately.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.220
Don't rush.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.030
Finish eating first.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.420
I'm full. I'm full.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.010
Sit down when I tell you to.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.570
The spread of this incident

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.010
must be kept to an absolute minimum,

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.140
especially

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.110
so it doesn't affect

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:17.000
investors'

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.360
willingness to invest.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.660
I'll go make things clear

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.790
with that reporter.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:24.980
What worries me more

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:25.890
are those young people

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.220
in the Mountain Patrol.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.550
I heard

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:30.260
that at the hospital,

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.320
they caused a scene

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.900
and even got into a fight.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:34.550
For now,

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.180
having Chief Shi Long

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.840
take them into the mountains
helps somewhat.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.710
But what about later?

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.840
You mean...

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.540
We should disband the Mountain Patrol?

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:50.980
Or find them

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.200
something else to do.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.440
In short,

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.230
we can't let them sit idle.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.380
The Joint Defense Team
should still be short-handed.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.180
How about

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:02.220
I discuss it

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.440
with Captain Sun?

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.550
I disagree
with disbanding the Mountain Patrol.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.370
Party Secretary,

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:11.840
what you were worried about earlier

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.660
makes sense.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.440
But I think it's too early to say.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.220
And I believe

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.070
Duojie will wake up.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.520
How can you...

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.320
Let me finish, Party Secretary.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.800
When Duojie was a township head,

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.170
I was still working as a technician

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:36.170
at the Qinghai-Tibet Highway
Construction Command.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.350
I was promoted a bit faster than him

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.960
simply because

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:41.720
I have a junior college degree.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.440
But when it comes to actual ability

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.900
and genuine feeling
for the Tibetan people,

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.550
I'm not as good as he is.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:54.990
During the snow disaster,

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.050
Duojie went more than forty hours

00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:59.380
without a wink of sleep,

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.590
ran all over the pastoral areas,

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:02.250
carried an elderly woman on his back,

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:03.050
and walked more than twenty kilometers

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.380
to get her to a hospital.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:06.870
If that had been me,

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.390
I'd have collapsed long ago.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:11.420
Everything Duojie

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.480
has achieved today

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.000
comes from his real capability

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:17.270
and the support of the people.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.780
Step by step,

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.540
he earned it through hard work.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.480
Party Secretary,

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.490
the Mountain Patrol cannot be without him.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.440
And Mazhi County

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.160
needs him even more.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.550
I also hope Comrade Duojie

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.240
wakes up soon.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:39.560
But I'm considering

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.000
the worst-case scenario.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.270
So we have to hold the Mountain Patrol

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.510
together for him.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.010
With such rudimentary equipment

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:48.610
and limited supplies,

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:49.120
Duojie has

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.380
led his team to work
out there for so long.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.060
Most people couldn't do it.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.680
Their work is very meaningful.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.940
What Lin said

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.380
was very well put.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:07.870
Party Secretary,

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.420
I also agree

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.680
with County Mayor Lin.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:15.810
From now on,

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.740
we'll mobilize the county militia

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.410
to support their operations.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.290
Even if they can't go into the mountains
with them,

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.000
they can at least help share the burden

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.330
by manning checkpoints

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.190
along the highways.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.260
This is where

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.990
the suspect with the severed finger
escaped last time.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.910
Locals who go into the mountains

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:33.760
call it Erdaogou.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.820
We call it Suomaqu.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.150
It'll take about two days

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:37.460
to get there.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.290
Chief.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:49.890
Bai Ju.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.550
We have enough people.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.680
You don't need to go.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.070
I take responsibility

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.530
for the suspect's escape.

00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:58.790
I want a chance

00:25:58.790 --> 00:25:59.940
to make up for this.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.580
But I also have to think about

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.710
how the Mountain Patrol members feel.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.500
Deputy County Mayor Duo

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.810
is important here as well.

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:17.010
Take good care of him.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.790
And wait for us to come back.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:50.500
Come here!

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.630
We are the Mountain Patrol!

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.220
We are the Mountain Patrol!

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.420
Everyone, come here!

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:56.780
Come here!

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:58.750
Everyone, come here!

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.220
Is anyone in the tent?

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:01.550
Come.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.480
Come, quick.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.310
Is anyone in the tent?

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:03.710
Quick.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.610
Move faster.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.890
Did you see anyone

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.740
with fingers missing on his right hand?

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:12.940
He's about my height.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.450
No.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:13.760
No.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:14.250
No.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:16.750
How about you?

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.640
None of you has seen him?

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.520
Don't hold anything back.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:23.050
Come on.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.250
One, two, three.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:03.000
Go that way!

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.470
Go!

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.810
Go. Go. Go.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:05.590
I'm sorry.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:06.750
It's okay, Guo.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.410
Don't be so formal.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:09.820
People from the Mountain Patrol

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:10.970
have all stayed at our house.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:13.970
When there are a lot of people,
they sleep on the floor.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.740
I see.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.300
Is your face okay?

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.620
My face?

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:21.940
It's fine.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.450
But, Guo.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.760
You really surprised me.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:33.420
You look gentle,

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:35.210
but you were fierce in a fight.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.570
That was just instinct.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.530
I can't stand seeing them
gang up on people.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.640
You're a good person.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:47.500
Ju is a good person, too.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.170
Do you like Ju?

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:58.740
We just have a working relationship.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.940
Don't be ridiculous.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:01.870
I think she likes you, too.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:02.500
Really?

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:07.570
I didn't notice.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:09.450
In situations like this,

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.120
it's easier to see
when you're not involved.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.980
You definitely wouldn't notice.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.030
Is this your big brother?

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:22.290
Yes, he's Bai Chun.

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:23.440
He's in the army

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.570
and is about to be promoted to an officer.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:26.450
He looks kind.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.330
Of course.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:30.900
Right.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:32.790
You can wear his slippers.

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:35.200
Here.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:35.900
Okay.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.810
They're a little dirty.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:37.410
It's fine.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.640
I'll wash my feet in a bit anyway.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.430
Let me tell you,

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:41.450
my big brother

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:42.790
treats everyone well,

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:44.930
especially my second sister.

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:46.810
Because she

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.030
was adopted,

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.240
he paid her extra attention.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.000
Whenever he has something good,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.330
he gives it to her first.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.310
Look at the time.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:55.730
Why aren't you asleep?

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:56.660
Bai Ji,

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:57.980
stop dragging him

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.110
into endless chats.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:01.610
You're not asleep, either.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:14.310
Ju went out.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.480
Where is she going this late?

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.740
Do you even have to ask?

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.890
She went to the hospital to see Duojie.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:38.190
Here.

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.340
Auntie asked me to give it to you.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:45.180
Thanks.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:56.640
Was my little brother talking too much

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.170
and disturbing your sleep?

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:09.330
Not really.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.540
He is quite interesting.

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:13.830
He...

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.670
sees things pretty clearly.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.270
You guys were talking about me, right?

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.070
He said a lot
of bad things about me, right?

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.180
You're quite self-aware.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:41.980
He said you're stubborn,

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.780
always putting on a tough front,

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.810
taking everything

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:46.090
onto yourself.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.680
Even when it's clearly not your fault,

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:51.840
you insist on taking the blame.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:53.590
The more you do that,

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:54.850
the more people worry.

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:58.940
You're just teasing me.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.020
Bai Ji wouldn't say things like that.

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:08.050
True.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:10.740
He didn't say it.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.980
I said it.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:15.770
Bai Ju.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:18.710
No one can see the future.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.840
This was an accident.

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:23.430
I don't think you did anything wrong.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:24.170
If they had

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:25.850
really opened fire back then,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.400
in a way,

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.620
they'd be no different

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.170
from the man

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:30.430
who killed Dongzhiba.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.420
What you did

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.500
stopped them from crossing the line.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.780
I know I didn't do anything wrong.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:41.570
I don't need you to tell me.

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:51.980
Then why are you always up at night?

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:55.460
I just wanted

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.700
to keep watch here.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.160
Is that a problem?

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:00.400
Fine.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.120
Well, I can't sleep either.

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:11.840
Mainly because I haven't slept
in a bed for a long time.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.840
I'm not used to it.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.199
Back with the Mountain Patrol,

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:15.030
we were all crammed together,

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.630
and it stunk.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.570
Now, your place

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:18.820
reeks of disinfectant.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:19.400
I...

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:43.070
You didn't even think

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.730
to get yourself a thick coat.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.090
You've got a runny nose from the cold.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:52.409
Alright, stop wiping it.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:53.780
You don't have it.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:54.730
It wasn't easy

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:55.710
getting warm,

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:57.660
and you let all the heat out.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.010
Bai Ju.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:33.630
There's actually something

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:34.620
I've been wanting to discuss

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.810
with you properly.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:44.150
Ever since I've been
with the Mountain Patrol,

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:45.880
I've been observing everyone,

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.340
especially you.

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.020
I actually paid the most attention to you.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.820
And I've been thinking...

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:09.500
What the Mountain Patrol does

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.430
is the work of the Forestry Police.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.050
Many places

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:14.980
have this type of police force.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.840
Why doesn't your county have one?

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.210
In our county,

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:25.940
there isn't even a single tree.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.960
Why would we need Forestry Police?

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.340
Forestry Police don't just manage forests.

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:30.880
They are responsible

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.090
for protecting wildlife

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:33.360
and ecological security,

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.440
and they are an armed force

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.900
with both criminal investigative

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.550
and administrative law-enforcement

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:38.380
authority.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:46.980
We didn't take good care of you last time.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:47.970
My apologies.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.790
Not at all.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.590
I just haven't come here enough.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:51.360
I wasn't acclimated.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:51.940
Look,

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:53.570
I'm much better this time.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.070
I don't even need oxygen.

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.710
We actually have oxygen prepared for you.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:58.570
But it's better

00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:59.550
not to use it.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:00.590
If you use it too much,

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:01.480
you'll become dependent.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.550
Right.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:05.190
County Mayor Lin.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:06.980
Feng showed me

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:08.070
the new part

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.360
of your mineral exploration report.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.110
I'm interested in the silver mine

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:14.390
near Gailacuo.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.260
The altitude there

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.440
should be over 4,500 meters.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.450
4,600.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.300
But the ore grade is better.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.560
How does the saying go?

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.730
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:29.890
You have great courage, Mr. Zhao.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.670
Then, when

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.270
our report is finalized

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.010
and the development zone plan is set,

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:36.050
your company

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:38.280
can participate in the public tender.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:39.820
Well...

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.420
You can take your time

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:44.480
working on that finalized report.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:46.570
County Mayor Lin,

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:48.530
could you let our company

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.440
start

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.590
a pilot project first?

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:56.640
A... a pilot project?

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.060
Actually,

00:37:58.090 --> 00:37:59.000
this is the experience

00:37:59.000 --> 00:37:59.880
we've gained from

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.190
other projects.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:04.560
There's a small place in Hunan
that produces copper.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.940
Our company was the first

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:06.800
to move in.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:07.500
Back then,

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.030
there were no development zones,

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.360
no planning of any kind.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.320
People just saw
that our company

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.090
was doing well,

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:13.770
so more and more businesses followed.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:14.960
That's when standardized management

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.420
was put in place.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:17.760
Now,

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:19.100
investment promotion there

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.580
is doing quite well.

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.320
The annual output value

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.590
is over 100 million.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:25.930
Let me put it this way.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.930
Start with a small-scale project

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.550
and create

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:31.260
a successful case first.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.530
That's far more convincing

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:34.990
than ten reports on paper.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:38.890
But now,

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.850
things are different from before.

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:42.380
Besides,

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:43.300
our situation here

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.500
is also quite unique.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.260
Doing it this way—

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.750
isn't this a bit against regulations?

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:51.550
Well...

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.470
I'm only making a suggestion.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:54.800
Ultimately,

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.130
it's up to you to decide,
County Mayor Lin.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.300
How about this?

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:01.960
We'll convene a leadership meeting

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.640
to discuss it.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.470
Okay.

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.860
The finance department

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:06.570
has allocated

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:07.940
another fifty thousand yuan.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:08.740
That's great.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:10.060
Which fund is it?

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:11.730
A designated grant for renovating

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.200
the showers at the County Hospital.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.750
[Tianduo Municipal
Finance Bureau Document]

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.480
What about the funds
for the disaster-stricken pastoral areas?

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.210
It still hasn't been approved.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:20.230
See? The health department

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.890
works much more efficiently.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:24.860
So, all this 50,000

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:26.910
goes to the County Hospital?

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.300
Director Zhang has been applying for it

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.280
for a year now.

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:31.920
And this 50,000

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:33.210
was already cut down.

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:34.840
If we cut it any further,

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.150
that shower room

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:37.750
definitely won't get built.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.990
Give it all to the hospital.

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:43.840
As for Quduo Township...

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.480
Keep applying.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.380
What are you doing?

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:56.480
Mom.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.130
Why do you walk without making a sound?

00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:59.560
Are you cold?

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.120
You're shivering.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.760
You scared me, that's all.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.900
Did you stay at the hospital
all night again?

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.760
Shao Yunfei is so fussy.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.150
He insisted on washing his hair.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.690
Since we'd already heated up
so much water,

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:13.150
I might as well wash up too.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:15.530
That young man...

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:16.840
he's really tough.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:17.860
Yeah.

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:19.000
You didn't have to

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.400
let him stay at our house.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:21.260
He's used to pulling all-nighters

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:22.270
to meet deadlines.

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.800
His longest stretch

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.530
was 48 hours without any sleep.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:26.300
I mean,

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.190
on top of that,
he still has to keep you company

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.400
and put up with you.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:32.560
He's really something.

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:35.270
Most people wouldn't have the patience.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.270
How far have you gotten?

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:41.380
Just started.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.840
I haven't even finished
using the shampoo yet.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.780
Don't play dumb.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.000
What?

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.660
What do you mean, "what"?

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.550
The way Reporter Shao looks at you

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:51.420
is different from

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.000
how he looks at everyone else.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:53.710
In our Mountain Patrol,

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:54.530
I'm the only woman.

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:55.900
The way he looks at me
compared to Duojie and the others

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:56.530
is definitely different.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:57.360
But before,

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:59.000
when we were at the hospital,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:40:59.530
your Uncle Lin

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:00.530
called him out.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:02.380
I noticed the way you looked at him

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:02.860
was different, too.

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:03.720
When did I...

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.660
Mom.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:05.290
Quick.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.320
It's in my eyes. Water.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.230
There you go again.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:08.650
Really. It stings so badly.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:09.000
Okay, okay.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.880
Close your eyes and lower your head.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.980
You're grown already,

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.510
and you're still so clumsy
washing your hair.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:17.760
I know right now,

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:19.520
you're not in the mood for this,

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.440
and don't want to listen to me.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.440
Then don't say it.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.820
But since I saw it,

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:26.920
I have to give you

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.970
a reminder.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:29.460
Reporter Shao

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.790
isn't from around here.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.500
He'll have to go back sooner or later.

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:35.630
I get what you mean.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.620
You're just being too sensitive.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:42.530
How can a mother not be sensitive?

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.650
When you were young,

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:46.600
you and Shao

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.890
always had to wear your hair the same way.

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:50.110
Otherwise, you'd get into a fight

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:51.370
over a single hair tie.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:53.570
I had to divide up

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:54.700
the new clothes and hair ties

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.030
for you well in advance.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.790
Your younger brother

00:41:58.090 --> 00:41:59.800
was always sneaking money from home

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.030
to buy snacks.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.800
In middle school,

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:03.850
your sister went behind my back

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:05.180
and dated boys.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.350
How could I not keep an eye on her?

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.390
I'm just not sensitive

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:11.250
when it comes to your big brother.

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:12.850
He puts my mind at ease.

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:15.510
He joined the army,
and the army managed him.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.080
Being too sensitive isn't a good thing.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.660
I should be like your dad—

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:22.570
big-hearted,

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:26.070
doing whatever he wanted.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:28.050
He said

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.530
there must be a tree

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:30.890
in front of this house.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.980
Then he just grabbed a sapling

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:34.910
and planted it right in the ground.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.890
Everyone in the county said

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.620
trees couldn't grow here.

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:42.650
He said it would survive.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:43.800
Look,

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:46.570
he said it would survive, and it did.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.690
I should learn from him,

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.020
stop interfering,

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:53.310
and let you do whatever you want.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.360
Before, I told Duojie

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.960
not to let you go into the mountains,

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.010
and it upset you.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.450
I was overstepping.
