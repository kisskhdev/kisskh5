WEBVTT

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.880
Watch out!

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.530
Fuu!

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.530
Are you hurt?

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.220
Are you okay?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.100
"The Boy Next World My Destiny"
(Episode 3)

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.840
Are you sure nothing hurts?

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.480
Yeah.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.410
How about here?

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.220
Does this hurt?

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.700
What about here?

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.120
You're really okay?

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.210
Sara-senpai...

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.090
you're acting just like my mom.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.640
Your mom...?

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.320
Yeah.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.570
It brings back memories.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.610
My mom...

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.470
She moved to Australia right
after my dad passed away.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.510
I guess she couldn't help it.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.520
She said staying in Japan just
reminded her of him too much.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.960
She used to cry every single day.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.190
So now we mostly just talk on the phone.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.570
It's a little lonely,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.160
but it was my choice.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.430
Did you choose to stay
here to be with your father?

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.870
Huh?

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.850
Oh...

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.920
Did the other Fuu tell you that?

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.240
Oh, right.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.040
I've made up my mind.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.440
I'm going to help you
get back to your world.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.140
Back to the person you love.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
(Fuu: Meeting at 9:00! Don't forget!)

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.760
See? The answer was right there.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.740
Yeah.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.860
You're a handsome one.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.260
I bet you've broken quite a few hearts.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.650
You're haunted by the
grudges of many women.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.340
It's quite a serious situation.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.570
Evil spirits? What should he do?

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.460
There's only one way.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.970
You...

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.640
should move in and live with me.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.660
That way,

00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:54.670
I can protect you 24 hours a day.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.870
What do you say?

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.470
Sara-senpai, let's get out of here.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.550
If it saves you, it's a
small price to pay, right?

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.020
I'm so sorry.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.400
I heard this place was really accurate.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.410
Heard? From who?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.950
The reviews online.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.300
I really thought this would help
get you back to your world.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.870
Ugh, I'm so stupid.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.240
I actually had a great time.

00:04:37.123 --> 00:04:39.033
Getting to spend the whole day with you.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.390
Hey, Taiga.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.710
Who's that guy?

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.410
The one holding hands with Sara.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.340
Are those two dating?

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.470
I have no idea.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.030
Why not?

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.320
Aren't you the one who looks after him?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.070
No, I'm not. Give that back.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.459
But Sara doesn't really talk

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.310
to anyone except you, does he?

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.800
How did they even end up together?

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.770
Who knows.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.820
Anyway, that guy owes us an explanation.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.880
Huh?

00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:42.260
Well, obviously.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.560
He's hogging our Sara all to himself.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.700
We're counting on you, Taiga.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.600
You're our only hope.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.560
Wait... me?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.610
Alright, alright, what's Fuu up to now?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.530
Where is Fuu Yotsuba?

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800
Is he in class?

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.460
I don't know.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.430
Then give me his contact info.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.950
That cloud...

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.480
Doesn't it look like a tiger?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.480
It's a lion.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.689
But it doesn't have a mane.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.900
It's a lioness. It doesn't have stripes.

00:06:25.283 --> 00:06:26.453
No, it's definitely a tiger.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.860
A tiger.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.750
It's totally a tiger.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.990
Because I said so.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.460
If you say so.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.760
You shouldn't worry so much.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.160
Tiger-senpai.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.230
It's not Tiger.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.460
It's Taiga.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.070
Hey!

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.810
Where's Fuu Yotsuba's contact info?

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:50.690
Oh.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.020
Hey!

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.040
Be honest with me.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.610
Does Sara have some kind of dirt on you?

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:05.930
Dirt?

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.880
Is he threatening you or bullying you?

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.330
That's what's happening, right?

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.950
I'm sorry.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.400
I'll apologize on his behalf.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.460
I'll have a serious talk with him.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.150
He's not doing anything like that.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.290
Well, that's a relief.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.700
That guy...

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.780
He's been saying some
really weird stuff lately.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.520
Ah...

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:31.960
You mean...

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.970
Like how we're dating?

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.640
Yeah, exactly that.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.850
You've never even spoken to him before.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.210
Why would he suddenly start saying that?

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.580
Is he okay in the head?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.040
Anyway, I'm not being threatened. I'm fine.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.060
Besides, Sara-senpai is a good person.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.720
Sara? A good person?

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.450
No way.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.989
If his dad hadn't asked
me to look out for him,

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.190
I wouldn't give him the time of day.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.939
He pushes everything onto
others and never apologizes.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.350
He's just an arrogant jerk.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.360
How can you say that about him?

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.240
Fine, then go ahead and date him.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.699
If he has a boyfriend,

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.830
then I can finally
retire as his babysitter.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.540
He's your problem now.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.570
No returns allowed!

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.120
I'm out.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.230
What does he mean, "He's your problem"?

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.730
Oh, and tomorrow after school...

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.250
Come by the student council office.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.040
I need your help with something.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.350
Yes!

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.060
Finally, I don't have to clean
up Sara's messes anymore.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:27.300
(Fuu: I talked to Taiga-senpai today.)

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.500
(Sara: I see.)

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.520
That's it?

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:49.200
(Fuu: Taiga-senpai is
really worried about you.)

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.880
He left me on read!

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:15.700
(Sara: Stop talking to Taiga.)

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.800
(Sara: Sorry, I'm just a little jealous.)

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.700
(Fuu: Come out to the balcony.)

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:07.830
Knock, knock.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.910
Earth to Sara.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.170
Can you hear me?

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.540
Fuu!

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.840
That's dangerous.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.040
I had to make sure you were listening.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.840
I'm listening.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.680
So, tomorrow...

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.010
Taiga-senpai asked me to help him out.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.310
Taiga?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Yeah.

00:12:02.353 --> 00:12:04.573
He used to be the student
council president, right?

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.660
It's probably something
for the student council.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.260
That guy...

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.860
Never mind.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.070
You don't have to go.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.010
I'll tell him no for you.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.730
Honestly, it's because of stuff like this
that everyone's afraid of you.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.870
Are you afraid of me too, Fuu?

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:39.870
Not at all.

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.450
That's why I think
everyone is being ridiculous.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.650
I don't care what they think.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.170
I'm only kind to you.

00:13:05.183 --> 00:13:08.203
Because I don't want you
to be afraid or avoid me.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.260
But...

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.550
"Fuu" doesn't like that.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.870
Sara-senpai...

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.590
You're actually such a nice person.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.890
You finally called yourself "Fuu."

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.780
Ah, so you're the one
everyone's talking about.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:17.630
Talking about?

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:19.890
Hey.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.330
You're dating Sara, right?

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.190
Huh?

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.060
Uh...

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.550
How did you land someone like Sara?

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.460
What's he like with you?

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.220
Is he cold to you too?

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:50.510
Well...

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.400
Knock it off.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.520
Don't pick on your junior.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.850
We weren't picking on him.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:07.460
That's enough.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.030
Sara's getting angry.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.720
Maya, let's go.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.760
Okay.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:38.630
I'll help.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.720
Wait, Sara...

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.790
Sara.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.150
Come here for a second.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.510
Just come here.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.850
Hurry up.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:39.850
What is it?

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.260
Fuu is waiting for me.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.370
Are you really the Sara I know?

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.760
You used to hate sharing food
with anyone else.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.230
But he's special.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.690
There you go again.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:00.710
Always with that line.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.500
You should go back to the hospital.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.120
Your brain must still be
scrambled from the accident.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.430
Taiga.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.820
Do you know who you're talking to?

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.050
Look, flirt all you want,

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.140
but if "that person" finds out,
you're the one who'll pay...

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.620
That's none of your business.

00:17:23.803 --> 00:17:25.023
Fine, I'm done.

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:28.210
Don't blame me for whatever happens next.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:32.940
Aren't you going to kiss me?

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.610
Kissing someone while they're
asleep is a bit much, don't you think?

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:48.020
I'm already awake...

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.700
Fuu?

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.060
What's wrong?

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.050
I was just thinking... I kissed someone
who already has a boyfriend again.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:12.250
But my boyfriend is Fuu,
no matter which world it is.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.380
Yeah.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.780
They have the same face and the same name.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.570
But they're different people.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.370
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:33.430
I'm the one at fault.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.490
Good morning.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.680
Morning.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.160
Don't look at me.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.490
I just woke up.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:19.170
Why not?

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.210
You're so cute.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.440
Are you going to keep ignoring me?

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.530
You're so selfish.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.330
Just a little longer.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:00.710
It's okay.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:02.700
I like eating here.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.589
Have you ever wondered
what life would be like

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.140
if we had never met?

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:14.590
I probably

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:15.940
wouldn't have made it.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:19.530
And neither would you.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.330
Hey.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:22.730
Promise me.

00:22:23.477 --> 00:22:24.816
Promise you won't leave me.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.950
You forgot your umbrella again.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.380
Because I knew you'd bring me one.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.499
I'll get into university first

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.769
and wait for you there.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.440
I know you'll get in too.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:47.870
It's a promise, okay?

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.410
Don't leave me. Stay by my side forever.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.520
I can't live without you anymore.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.500
How could I ever say that?

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:23.450
Because

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.460
I...

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:30.610
Liar.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.410
Why did you lie and say
you were dating Naruka?

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.030
Well,

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.149
telling her I have a new girlfriend

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.690
was the cleanest way
to break up, wasn't it?

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.780
What if she tries to take it out on Naruka?

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:45.499
- You should just die.
- That's terrifying.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.190
I get it. I'll apologize.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.290
Forgive me.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.010
Yutori.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.020
It's fine.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.610
Yutori will protect me, right?

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.270
Don't let it happen again.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:02.510
Thanks.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.040
Oh, what about you, Fuu?

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:08.690
How are things with Sara-senpai?

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.790
It's nothing like that. We're not...

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.120
Really?

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:14.920
But I see you guys together all the time.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:16.960
I even saw you holding hands.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.840
Oh, speak of the devil.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.820
Isn't that Sara-senpai?

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.770
Huh? Where?

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.270
Just kidding!

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:28.600
Stop it.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.330
There's no way it's nothing.
"There's really nothing..." Ow!

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.520
Sara-senpai.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.580
Fuu.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.720
What are you doing?

00:25:38.503 --> 00:25:39.520
Well,

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:41.490
I thought of something.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.510
Until you can get back to your world,

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.000
I'll be your stand-in.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:58.170
A stand-in?

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.480
Yeah.

00:26:00.786 --> 00:26:02.695
If the Fuu in your world
is anything like me,

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.950
I'm sure he'd forgive me.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.100
It's better than you being lonely.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.390
Because you need your Fuu, right?

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.720
Come on, smile.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.720
You look best when you're smiling.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.110
Thank you.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.010
For everything you've done...

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.600
I know it's selfish,

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.530
but

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:47.770
I don't want to let go of either Fuu.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.740
I heard he's a student
at the same university.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.260
They've been spending a
lot of time together lately.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.670
He doesn't seem to understand

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.690
exactly

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.920
who he belongs to.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.170
Here, if you'd like some.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:06.690
Oh, my.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.660
Make sure to save one for him today, too.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:13.000
The special curry bread, right?

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.640
I know, I know.
