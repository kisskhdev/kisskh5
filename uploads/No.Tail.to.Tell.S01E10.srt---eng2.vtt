WEBVTT

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.066
NO TAIL TO TELL

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.860
{\an8}WOOSONG HOSPITAL

00:00:56.453 --> 00:00:57.412
{\an8}EMERGENCY ROOM

00:01:06.797 --> 00:01:07.839
{\an8}Are you okay?

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.885
{\an8}Are you all right?

00:01:25.607 --> 00:01:27.385
{\an8}Hey, Eun-ho.

00:01:28.944 --> 00:01:31.154
What… Eun-ho!

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:33.156
Where did she go?

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:37.869
Clear the way!

00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:43.542
- What…
- Are you family?

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:45.419
Well, my friend is in there.

00:01:45.502 --> 00:01:47.879
- Hyeon Woo-seok is in there, right?
- You can't just barge in.

00:01:47.963 --> 00:01:50.173
I told you, I'm his friend.

00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:53.802
I just need to check on him.
It'll only take a few minutes.

00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:55.846
- Hey, you can't!
- Please!

00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:58.932
Aren't you Si-yeol?

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.268
Mr. Hyeon.

00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:02.352
How's Woo-seok?

00:02:03.103 --> 00:02:04.479
Is Woo-seok okay?

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:06.732
What is happening?

00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:08.900
Why did Woo-seok suddenly collapse?

00:02:09.526 --> 00:02:12.154
Is he really going to die?
Then what about Si-yeol?

00:02:14.448 --> 00:02:17.951
Say something! I'm sure you showed up
because you have something to say.

00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:23.457
Did you think tampering with human fate
was a trivial matter?

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:26.042
What?

00:02:26.126 --> 00:02:27.544
Charging 150 joules.

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:29.129
Clear!

00:02:29.212 --> 00:02:31.047
Charging 200 joules. Two, clear!

00:02:38.263 --> 00:02:39.973
Sinus rhythm is back.

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:43.894
- Start a saline drip, wide open.
- On it.

00:02:43.977 --> 00:02:47.397
He's not dead. Not yet.

00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:50.525
Not yet? What does that mean?

00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:53.487
He will eventually die.

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:57.073
Just not today.

00:02:57.157 --> 00:02:59.826
That's the fate

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:02.746
you gave him.

00:03:05.332 --> 00:03:09.252
Does that mean Si-yeol's fate was…

00:03:09.336 --> 00:03:13.006
To rise high, but burn out quickly.

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:16.092
That was the fate
Kang Si-yeol was born with.

00:03:16.927 --> 00:03:20.639
On the other hand,
a long but difficult life

00:03:20.722 --> 00:03:24.142
was the fate Hyeon Woo-seok was born with.

00:03:28.522 --> 00:03:30.565
Then what am I supposed to do?

00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:32.943
I don't like either option.

00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:37.489
I don't want to make Si-yeol
watch his friend die in his place

00:03:37.572 --> 00:03:40.242
or return to his original life and die.

00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:43.370
There must be another way.

00:03:43.453 --> 00:03:45.330
Change fate, twist it, whatever.

00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:49.251
If they were given such a crappy fate,
there must be a loophole or something!

00:03:49.334 --> 00:03:52.879
You still haven't learned a thing.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.216
You recklessly tampered with human fate,

00:03:56.883 --> 00:04:00.262
caused an innocent man to die again,

00:04:00.762 --> 00:04:05.058
and now you seek cheap tricks
to deceive Heaven?

00:04:05.892 --> 00:04:08.061
That's right. I'll find a way.

00:04:09.104 --> 00:04:11.815
That's how I've survived until now,

00:04:11.898 --> 00:04:16.570
and I have no intention
of ever accepting such a crappy fate.

00:04:21.283 --> 00:04:23.785
The only thing I can give you now…

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:30.125
is this.

00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:40.385
When this season ends,

00:04:40.927 --> 00:04:47.267
Kang Si-yeol's true fate is to die
before he sees another winter.

00:04:47.893 --> 00:04:51.646
So, before Hyeon Woo-seok
dies in his place,

00:04:52.272 --> 00:04:56.109
fix this twisted fate
with your own two hands.

00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:18.465
What on earth
am I supposed to fix with this?

00:05:18.548 --> 00:05:20.967
You already know

00:05:21.051 --> 00:05:23.762
what that dagger is

00:05:23.845 --> 00:05:26.222
and what you should do.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.901
Stab him with this. You have to.

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:41.196
Commit an unforgivable sin,

00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:44.574
and turn all your cultivated virtue
to nothing.

00:05:45.992 --> 00:05:48.453
If you stab your beloved with that dagger,

00:05:49.287 --> 00:05:51.373
the twisted fate will return to its place,

00:05:51.456 --> 00:05:54.584
and you can return to being
a nine-tailed fox again.

00:05:56.378 --> 00:05:57.545
However,

00:05:58.088 --> 00:06:01.257
if you leave this twisted fate as it is

00:06:01.883 --> 00:06:05.845
and a man who shouldn't die
ends up dying instead…

00:06:07.973 --> 00:06:09.349
I will personally

00:06:09.432 --> 00:06:13.520
end your fate with that dagger.

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:15.981
Then, no matter what you do,

00:06:16.064 --> 00:06:19.234
you will never return to being
a nine-tailed fox.

00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:22.237
You'll live out your life

00:06:23.488 --> 00:06:26.449
as a human forever, like you are now.

00:06:36.084 --> 00:06:40.714
EPISODE 10
FROM CHANCE TO DESTINY

00:06:41.464 --> 00:06:43.675
His heart rate is back to normal,

00:06:43.758 --> 00:06:47.053
and thankfully, he woke right up.

00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:49.764
We were lucky he got
immediate emergency care.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.725
They said it could've been worse.

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:55.311
That's such a relief.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.314
You must have been quite shocked too.

00:06:58.398 --> 00:06:59.524
Yes.

00:07:00.358 --> 00:07:02.193
It was all so sudden.

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:04.404
Si-yeol.

00:07:05.697 --> 00:07:08.033
Thanks for rushing over,
even at this hour.

00:07:09.117 --> 00:07:10.285
I appreciate it.

00:07:12.287 --> 00:07:14.039
I wish you could see Woo-seok,

00:07:14.122 --> 00:07:16.750
but they're running further tests
on him right now.

00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:20.670
Is there another problem?

00:07:21.755 --> 00:07:24.799
It's nothing like that.
Just standard procedure.

00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:28.845
Judging by his condition,
I don't expect any lasting damage.

00:07:29.387 --> 00:07:30.388
Don't worry too much.

00:07:31.765 --> 00:07:32.849
Okay.

00:07:35.643 --> 00:07:38.229
Anyway, I should get going.

00:07:41.107 --> 00:07:43.151
I'll let Woo-seok know you stopped by.

00:07:43.234 --> 00:07:44.986
- See you around.
- Okay.

00:08:18.228 --> 00:08:21.022
It's a relief that he's still alive.

00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:24.651
Yeah.

00:08:25.819 --> 00:08:28.947
I'd feel much better
if I could've seen his face.

00:08:30.073 --> 00:08:31.449
He should be okay, right?

00:08:35.453 --> 00:08:36.788
By the way,

00:08:37.872 --> 00:08:41.376
what kind of person
is this Woo-seok anyway?

00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:44.170
What?

00:08:45.421 --> 00:08:46.548
I'm just curious.

00:08:47.715 --> 00:08:49.509
Surely he's someone special

00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:52.971
if you'd go as far as to give up
your wish for him?

00:08:54.013 --> 00:08:58.143
Even now, you're worrying about him first
instead of how close you came

00:08:58.226 --> 00:09:00.228
to never getting your old life back.

00:09:02.313 --> 00:09:05.817
You make it sound
like it's some huge deal.

00:09:07.318 --> 00:09:09.696
We're just friends.

00:09:11.072 --> 00:09:13.575
And friends make sacrifices
for each other.

00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:17.787
I get a little upset sometimes,
but I still worry about him.

00:09:18.746 --> 00:09:21.166
Come on, what kind of answer is that?

00:09:21.249 --> 00:09:23.459
If he's that special to you,

00:09:23.543 --> 00:09:26.504
I thought you'd tell me
about some hidden talent

00:09:26.588 --> 00:09:28.214
or that he's actually a pretty decent guy.

00:09:28.298 --> 00:09:31.551
Is that really all there is to him?

00:09:34.345 --> 00:09:35.763
Woo-seok is

00:09:36.764 --> 00:09:38.474
kind of a coward.

00:09:39.893 --> 00:09:42.270
He's great at giving
but awful at receiving,

00:09:42.896 --> 00:09:44.272
and he's a little pathetic too.

00:09:44.355 --> 00:09:46.774
He only wants me to see his good side,

00:09:46.858 --> 00:09:49.027
so he hides
whenever things don't go his way.

00:09:49.611 --> 00:09:50.862
He's got an inferiority complex.

00:09:50.945 --> 00:09:52.071
What?

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.616
Then why…

00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:58.286
But I still like him,
regardless of all that.

00:09:59.829 --> 00:10:01.706
I bet Woo-seok feels the same way.

00:10:02.665 --> 00:10:04.709
I'm selfish, self-centered,

00:10:05.335 --> 00:10:06.920
and totally full of myself.

00:10:07.462 --> 00:10:09.964
Woo-seok knows all that about me.

00:10:10.048 --> 00:10:12.759
But that's how childhood friends are.

00:10:13.885 --> 00:10:15.678
Even though we're pathetic and cowardly,

00:10:16.221 --> 00:10:17.305
none of that matters.

00:10:19.307 --> 00:10:20.391
I don't really get it.

00:10:21.893 --> 00:10:25.104
Shouldn't you dislike each other
if you're all that pathetic and cowardly?

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.690
- I think you already know.
- What?

00:10:27.774 --> 00:10:28.858
You like me, don't you?

00:10:30.026 --> 00:10:32.946
It's not because I'm the best
or somehow special

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:36.532
out of everyone you've ever met
in your long life.

00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:40.536
I became special to you
because you like me.

00:10:44.332 --> 00:10:48.378
I think that's what it means
to like someone.

00:10:52.298 --> 00:10:53.591
What if…

00:10:55.301 --> 00:10:59.639
I couldn't go back
to my true form because of you

00:10:59.722 --> 00:11:02.267
and had to live as a human forever?

00:11:03.851 --> 00:11:06.062
Would I still be able to like you then?

00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:08.439
What?

00:11:08.523 --> 00:11:11.109
If your friend had really died today,

00:11:11.734 --> 00:11:14.320
and you'd lost your chance
to get your fate back forever,

00:11:14.946 --> 00:11:18.491
would you still not resent me?

00:11:19.784 --> 00:11:21.577
Would you still like me?

00:11:23.246 --> 00:11:25.832
Eun-ho, are you okay?

00:11:26.582 --> 00:11:28.334
Did something happen earlier?

00:11:33.047 --> 00:11:34.215
Nothing happened.

00:11:35.258 --> 00:11:37.051
The thought just came to me.

00:11:38.803 --> 00:11:41.389
Are you telling me to choose?

00:11:42.056 --> 00:11:45.977
Kill Si-yeol, or give up who I am?

00:11:46.602 --> 00:11:48.229
It may seem cruel,

00:11:48.938 --> 00:11:51.524
but fate simply takes its course.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.987
It does not concern itself
with individual human affairs.

00:12:01.617 --> 00:12:03.870
Then why are you telling me to choose?

00:12:04.996 --> 00:12:06.539
If the will of Heaven is already set,

00:12:06.622 --> 00:12:09.125
you guys should decide
whether to kill him or save him.

00:12:14.213 --> 00:12:17.425
I almost fell for your tricks again.

00:12:17.508 --> 00:12:19.177
I keep forgetting

00:12:19.802 --> 00:12:22.972
that you guys act
like you know everything,

00:12:23.056 --> 00:12:24.807
but the truth is, you don't know anything.

00:12:24.891 --> 00:12:26.684
You were just trying to trick me

00:12:26.768 --> 00:12:29.896
into fixing these twisted
human affairs for you.

00:12:31.022 --> 00:12:33.441
But I found another way.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.527
So I'm not making that damn choice.

00:12:38.112 --> 00:12:40.490
Once I get my powers back,

00:12:40.573 --> 00:12:42.825
saving Si-yeol will be a piece of cake.

00:12:44.827 --> 00:12:48.039
I'll just stay by his side
and protect him forever.

00:12:52.502 --> 00:12:54.212
I'm suddenly so tired.

00:12:56.255 --> 00:12:57.507
Okay.

00:12:58.132 --> 00:13:00.343
You must be tired
after rushing out with me like that.

00:13:00.426 --> 00:13:03.388
Get some rest.
I'll wake you when we're there.

00:13:05.765 --> 00:13:06.724
Si-yeol.

00:13:08.518 --> 00:13:09.894
What I said earlier

00:13:10.645 --> 00:13:12.563
wasn't just the alcohol talking.

00:13:13.689 --> 00:13:14.607
What?

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.361
I told you I'd get your life back,
no matter what.

00:13:18.444 --> 00:13:19.404
That's a promise.

00:13:20.363 --> 00:13:22.657
So don't worry about it.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.744
Get some sleep.
We can worry about that tomorrow.

00:13:49.642 --> 00:13:51.686
Si-yeol, wake up! Come on!

00:13:52.228 --> 00:13:53.271
What…

00:13:54.397 --> 00:13:55.857
What's got into you so early?

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.984
We saw yesterday
that we're gaining spiritual power,

00:13:58.067 --> 00:14:00.486
and now that we know how,
we need to hurry.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.364
Right.
We have to do good deeds.

00:14:04.532 --> 00:14:05.867
Do you have a plan or something?

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.077
Technically, it's not doing good deeds.

00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:11.205
I'm fixing the misdeeds I committed.

00:14:11.289 --> 00:14:14.041
I made a list of everything
that came to mind, so listen.

00:14:15.877 --> 00:14:17.545
Chairman Jin of Pyeongchang-dong.

00:14:18.254 --> 00:14:21.674
What misdeed did you commit with him?

00:14:21.757 --> 00:14:25.511
Was it the late '90s?

00:14:26.262 --> 00:14:28.473
There was some land Chairman Jin wanted

00:14:28.556 --> 00:14:31.058
that the owner wouldn't sell,
no matter what.

00:14:31.142 --> 00:14:33.978
So you forced him to sell it?

00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:36.898
Yeah, since I took money
from Chairman Jin,

00:14:36.981 --> 00:14:38.483
I had to do my part.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.818
Where was this land anyway?

00:14:42.028 --> 00:14:43.237
Pangyo.

00:14:44.155 --> 00:14:45.865
What? Pangyo?

00:14:45.948 --> 00:14:47.867
How could you--

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.162
I didn't know the area would boom.

00:14:51.245 --> 00:14:54.624
It was nothing but rice paddies back then.
I should've bought some.

00:14:54.707 --> 00:14:55.708
Unbelievable.

00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:57.543
Assemblyman Park of Hannam-dong.

00:14:57.627 --> 00:15:00.630
He was a real piece of work too.

00:15:03.049 --> 00:15:04.342
How does it look?

00:15:04.425 --> 00:15:07.386
Will this affect Woo-seok's career?

00:15:08.596 --> 00:15:10.181
I looked it up,

00:15:10.264 --> 00:15:14.101
and some players overseas play
with an implantable defibrillator.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.772
Does Woo-seok need to go that far?

00:15:18.397 --> 00:15:22.401
Well, depending on the cause
of the sudden cardiac arrest,

00:15:22.485 --> 00:15:24.737
that might be an option.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.115
We ran tests to figure that out,

00:15:28.908 --> 00:15:30.535
but how should I put this?

00:15:31.536 --> 00:15:33.579
The results aren't good.

00:15:36.415 --> 00:15:37.500
Excuse me?

00:15:41.546 --> 00:15:45.341
He has primary cardiac angiosarcoma.

00:15:46.968 --> 00:15:48.678
What is that?

00:15:49.679 --> 00:15:52.348
Simply put, it's heart cancer.

00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:54.934
Heart cancer…

00:15:58.437 --> 00:16:02.275
No. Cancer in the heart?
I've never heard of such a thing.

00:16:02.358 --> 00:16:06.696
Cancer cells
don't usually form in the heart,

00:16:06.779 --> 00:16:09.031
so this is a very rare case.

00:16:09.115 --> 00:16:13.619
It accounts for only 0.01%
of all cancer cases.

00:16:13.703 --> 00:16:15.162
Doctor!

00:16:15.663 --> 00:16:17.081
Didn't you see the news?

00:16:17.164 --> 00:16:19.750
Woo-seok just had
a medical check-up for his transfer.

00:16:19.834 --> 00:16:21.919
Surely your test is wrong?

00:16:22.003 --> 00:16:24.046
Heart cancer is tricky like that.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:28.509
There are no clear symptoms,
and it's so rare

00:16:28.593 --> 00:16:29.760
that it's hard to detect.

00:16:30.553 --> 00:16:31.679
How…

00:16:35.099 --> 00:16:37.643
Then what do we do now?

00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:40.062
There has to be a treatment, right?

00:16:40.146 --> 00:16:41.606
We don't care how much it costs--

00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:42.815
Am I…

00:16:44.567 --> 00:16:45.943
going to die?

00:16:47.903 --> 00:16:50.072
It's too late for surgery.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.784
And a transplant isn't a realistic option.

00:16:56.412 --> 00:16:57.913
You said it's rare.

00:16:58.414 --> 00:17:00.291
So you don't know much
about it either, do you?

00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:04.712
You should look into it more
before giving up!

00:17:04.795 --> 00:17:06.797
How can you call yourself a doctor?

00:17:08.341 --> 00:17:11.344
How much time do I have left?

00:17:14.764 --> 00:17:16.223
Six months at most.

00:17:16.807 --> 00:17:18.684
It could be less.

00:17:38.996 --> 00:17:40.748
What did I do that was so wrong?

00:17:40.831 --> 00:17:43.501
I didn't ask for too much.

00:17:44.001 --> 00:17:45.878
I didn't ask to live like this forever.

00:17:45.961 --> 00:17:48.547
I just wanted to live my dream for a bit.

00:17:48.631 --> 00:17:50.675
Why can't I even have that?

00:17:52.134 --> 00:17:53.344
Woo-seok.

00:17:54.762 --> 00:17:56.514
Something's wrong here.

00:18:00.309 --> 00:18:01.268
Dad.

00:18:02.395 --> 00:18:04.230
This shouldn't be happening to me.

00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:07.650
I know.

00:18:11.028 --> 00:18:14.448
Calm down, and let's get retested.

00:18:15.574 --> 00:18:17.952
That guy's a total quack.

00:18:18.577 --> 00:18:22.123
You've been training since you could walk.

00:18:22.206 --> 00:18:25.876
You can play a full match
without getting tired.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.545
How could you have heart problems?

00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:30.047
That's just ridiculous.

00:18:30.131 --> 00:18:32.383
No. That's not it.

00:18:37.138 --> 00:18:40.891
We can't go to another hospital.
We have to keep this a secret, Dad.

00:18:42.101 --> 00:18:43.853
- What?
- Pay off the doctor.

00:18:43.936 --> 00:18:45.271
Do whatever it takes!

00:18:46.731 --> 00:18:48.232
This can't get out.

00:18:49.442 --> 00:18:51.485
What are you talking about, Woo-seok?

00:18:51.569 --> 00:18:53.529
We need to get you tested again.

00:18:53.612 --> 00:18:55.156
Si-yeol…

00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:56.657
Forget all that.

00:18:58.451 --> 00:19:00.202
I need to see Si-yeol.

00:19:02.371 --> 00:19:06.917
So, these are all the misdeeds
you've committed?

00:19:07.001 --> 00:19:09.211
No, not exactly--

00:19:09.295 --> 00:19:10.504
Right?

00:19:10.588 --> 00:19:12.256
I thought the list was too--

00:19:12.339 --> 00:19:15.134
I only listed cases since Liberation.
I left out the Joseon era.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.804
We need the clients to still be alive
for us to do anything.

00:19:18.888 --> 00:19:21.640
Right. I see.

00:19:21.724 --> 00:19:24.477
You sure were diligent about making money.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.104
- Anyway, what do you think?
- What?

00:19:27.188 --> 00:19:30.316
Which one should we set right first?

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.860
Man, I don't know.

00:19:33.444 --> 00:19:35.029
There are just so many.

00:19:35.112 --> 00:19:37.198
Even if we just pick a few easy ones,

00:19:37.281 --> 00:19:39.867
I think the spiritual power
will build up fast.

00:19:44.246 --> 00:19:45.581
Wait.

00:19:49.418 --> 00:19:50.753
It's Woo-seok.

00:20:01.597 --> 00:20:03.057
It's locked.

00:20:08.103 --> 00:20:09.396
Just wait a second.

00:20:19.782 --> 00:20:20.991
What's up?

00:20:21.075 --> 00:20:23.202
Coach, the field is locked.

00:20:23.285 --> 00:20:24.870
What?

00:20:26.288 --> 00:20:27.915
Seriously, those guys.

00:20:28.457 --> 00:20:30.543
I asked them to just wait a few days.

00:20:32.795 --> 00:20:34.713
Pardon? Wait for what?

00:20:35.339 --> 00:20:36.715
Never mind.

00:20:37.341 --> 00:20:40.886
Look, there's no training today.

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.556
So just go home, rest up,
and take care of yourselves.

00:20:43.639 --> 00:20:46.058
Another day off?
We just got one yesterday.

00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:48.519
You guys aren't in the best shape.

00:20:48.602 --> 00:20:51.146
Hey, just do as I say and tell the guys.

00:20:57.361 --> 00:20:59.113
Here you go.

00:21:00.948 --> 00:21:02.491
Hello, sir.

00:21:02.575 --> 00:21:04.493
- Who are you?
- Oh, right.

00:21:04.577 --> 00:21:07.705
I sent you a text,
but I didn't get a reply.

00:21:07.788 --> 00:21:09.999
So I took the liberty
of coming to see you.

00:21:11.834 --> 00:21:12.835
Well…

00:21:13.502 --> 00:21:16.046
I'm with Daeheung Citizens FC.

00:21:16.797 --> 00:21:19.216
We're the soccer team
based here in Daeheung.

00:21:20.301 --> 00:21:21.844
I was wondering

00:21:21.927 --> 00:21:24.430
if you'd be inclined
to be our team's main sponsor.

00:21:24.513 --> 00:21:26.557
- No, we're good.
- Wait, sir!

00:21:27.224 --> 00:21:29.852
Please just take a look
and think about it.

00:21:30.394 --> 00:21:34.356
Your company name
would be right here on our uniforms.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.984
It'll really help your company's image
in the local community.

00:21:37.067 --> 00:21:39.695
And it'll really boost employee morale--

00:21:39.778 --> 00:21:41.071
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

00:21:41.155 --> 00:21:42.156
Yes, I'm going.

00:21:42.239 --> 00:21:44.950
Sir! I'll text you the details!

00:21:45.576 --> 00:21:46.952
What did Coach say?

00:21:47.036 --> 00:21:48.120
He said to go home.

00:21:48.746 --> 00:21:50.539
- That there's no training today.
- What?

00:21:50.623 --> 00:21:52.499
But we have an away game this weekend.

00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:55.169
Don't we need to prepare for it at all?

00:21:55.794 --> 00:21:58.505
I know. We really should train today.

00:21:59.924 --> 00:22:01.592
Do you want me to open it?

00:22:02.676 --> 00:22:03.677
Hey.

00:22:04.178 --> 00:22:05.888
We saw you at Si-yeol's place yesterday.

00:22:05.971 --> 00:22:08.140
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:22:08.223 --> 00:22:11.310
What a coincidence. You must live nearby.

00:22:11.393 --> 00:22:14.772
We came to train, but the gate's locked.

00:22:18.484 --> 00:22:19.485
That scared me.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.986
What the…

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.529
This just…

00:22:23.447 --> 00:22:24.448
It's open.

00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:26.075
What?

00:22:27.242 --> 00:22:30.287
Maybe this lock is defective.

00:22:30.371 --> 00:22:31.914
It was definitely locked earlier.

00:22:37.336 --> 00:22:40.381
Shouldn't we go in
and train by ourselves at least?

00:22:44.593 --> 00:22:45.678
Hey.

00:22:48.097 --> 00:22:49.264
Lock it again.

00:22:51.767 --> 00:22:53.894
Hurry up and lock it!

00:22:57.523 --> 00:23:01.151
As you can see, training's off,
so we're heading out to grab a bite.

00:23:01.235 --> 00:23:02.528
Have you eaten yet?

00:23:15.082 --> 00:23:15.958
Hey, Si-yeol.

00:23:17.251 --> 00:23:18.836
Hey…

00:23:19.837 --> 00:23:21.046
Are you okay?

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.966
Yeah.

00:23:24.049 --> 00:23:27.094
I'm fine.
I just need to rest for a few days.

00:23:29.555 --> 00:23:30.973
Come on in.

00:23:31.056 --> 00:23:33.017
Oh, okay.

00:23:43.777 --> 00:23:45.237
You came together?

00:23:46.905 --> 00:23:47.948
The thing is--

00:23:48.032 --> 00:23:50.576
I know. My memories came back.

00:23:52.327 --> 00:23:54.496
I know she's now human,

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.082
and that's why you can't switch
your life back.

00:23:58.333 --> 00:23:59.334
I remember everything now.

00:24:00.586 --> 00:24:01.712
Woo-seok.

00:24:01.795 --> 00:24:03.297
This has nothing to do with Si-yeol.

00:24:04.298 --> 00:24:06.425
I'm the one who had your memories wiped.

00:24:06.508 --> 00:24:07.593
I know that too.

00:24:07.676 --> 00:24:09.303
I'm not upset about it.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.014
I don't have the right to be.

00:24:13.599 --> 00:24:17.186
It's true that I wanted Si-yeol's life,
even for just a moment.

00:24:21.398 --> 00:24:24.318
Si-yeol, I don't know
if you'll believe me,

00:24:25.194 --> 00:24:27.321
but I didn't intend for this to happen.

00:24:27.404 --> 00:24:30.407
You know I'm not that kind of guy.

00:24:31.158 --> 00:24:33.577
I just wanted to live like this
for a few days,

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.370
then give it all back to you.

00:24:36.663 --> 00:24:38.749
But I couldn't stop thinking
about my dad.

00:24:39.249 --> 00:24:41.502
So I just started getting greedier.

00:24:42.211 --> 00:24:43.337
Honestly, that's how it felt.

00:24:44.171 --> 00:24:45.214
I know, man.

00:24:45.798 --> 00:24:49.384
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't a bit upset with you.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.722
But thanks for being honest with me now.

00:24:53.806 --> 00:24:55.015
Let's switch back.

00:24:56.308 --> 00:24:58.727
- What?
- Let's switch back now.

00:24:59.603 --> 00:25:02.314
Didn't you say you found a way?

00:25:02.397 --> 00:25:04.316
Back when you erased my memory.

00:25:04.399 --> 00:25:07.986
- It's not possible right now.
- Why?

00:25:08.612 --> 00:25:09.863
Why isn't it possible now?

00:25:12.032 --> 00:25:12.908
Woo-seok.

00:25:14.076 --> 00:25:16.286
No, it's just…

00:25:17.412 --> 00:25:19.915
It's because I don't trust myself.

00:25:19.998 --> 00:25:22.709
If I spend another day or two like this,

00:25:22.793 --> 00:25:25.546
I'll start thinking this is my life
and get even greedier.

00:25:25.629 --> 00:25:27.923
That's what'll happen.
Can you take responsibility for that?

00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:33.095
If I suddenly end up
back in my life overnight,

00:25:34.138 --> 00:25:36.515
how am I supposed to handle that?

00:25:39.309 --> 00:25:41.562
This is really quite rude, you know.

00:25:43.522 --> 00:25:46.441
We came to visit a patient
completely empty-handed.

00:25:47.276 --> 00:25:48.152
What?

00:25:48.235 --> 00:25:49.862
Go buy something, Si-yeol.

00:25:50.362 --> 00:25:53.115
Do you like fruit?
Go get a fruit basket or something.

00:25:54.241 --> 00:25:55.325
- Now?
- Yes.

00:25:57.661 --> 00:25:59.746
I hate humans

00:26:00.581 --> 00:26:02.457
who are rude.

00:26:17.848 --> 00:26:21.143
You know it too, don't you?
That you're going to die soon.

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:26.148
- How did you--
- Keep it a secret from Si-yeol.

00:26:26.231 --> 00:26:29.735
He cares about you more than I thought.

00:26:29.818 --> 00:26:31.737
It's more than you deserve.

00:26:32.362 --> 00:26:35.407
So you better hide
that you have ulterior motives.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:37.201
Don't let him catch you like I just did.

00:26:43.498 --> 00:26:45.667
I still can't believe I'm even doing this,

00:26:47.377 --> 00:26:49.254
but I want to protect him.

00:26:50.005 --> 00:26:53.217
If he believes in something
as cheesy as friendship,

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.510
I want to keep it that way.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:57.721
Then…

00:27:00.057 --> 00:27:01.892
you want me to just die?

00:27:03.685 --> 00:27:05.354
Without doing anything?

00:27:06.021 --> 00:27:07.064
Instead of Si-yeol?

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.652
If you don't want that,
make a deal with me.

00:27:14.321 --> 00:27:16.198
- A deal?
- Yes.

00:27:16.281 --> 00:27:19.368
I don't have much time either.
Just like you.

00:27:20.577 --> 00:27:22.829
So I need you to help me.

00:27:40.097 --> 00:27:42.891
By the way,
this isn't a restaurant, is it?

00:27:45.143 --> 00:27:48.397
Eating black bean noodles
at a pool hall is the best.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.690
Haven't you tried it?

00:27:50.315 --> 00:27:51.400
No.

00:27:51.483 --> 00:27:53.777
We made a bet on this two-on-two match.

00:27:54.361 --> 00:27:57.823
After I win, I'll treat you to noodles
and sweet and sour pork, the full spread.

00:27:58.907 --> 00:28:00.075
Sounds good.

00:28:00.158 --> 00:28:01.743
- Your turn.
- Okay!

00:28:04.121 --> 00:28:06.456
All right.

00:28:25.726 --> 00:28:26.935
Damn.

00:28:27.477 --> 00:28:29.646
I guess I picked a shot
that's way too hard.

00:28:31.315 --> 00:28:32.649
Or… maybe not?

00:28:39.364 --> 00:28:40.407
Si-yeol.

00:28:40.949 --> 00:28:42.159
Eun-ho.

00:28:42.242 --> 00:28:43.368
Why are you out here?

00:28:43.452 --> 00:28:44.745
Let's go.

00:28:44.828 --> 00:28:46.705
Wait, what about the fruit basket?

00:28:47.331 --> 00:28:49.207
Visiting hours are over. Let's just go.

00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:52.669
But I went all the way
to the store to buy this.

00:28:52.753 --> 00:28:53.670
We can't just leave.

00:28:53.754 --> 00:28:56.298
Why not? Just get a refund.

00:28:56.381 --> 00:28:58.592
Why did you even make me
go buy this anyway?

00:28:58.675 --> 00:29:02.179
You kept the receipt, right?
I know they'll definitely refund you.

00:29:03.388 --> 00:29:04.306
What?

00:29:10.562 --> 00:29:13.815
Beom, we're going to lose at this rate.

00:29:13.899 --> 00:29:15.901
Oh man, this is bad.

00:29:15.984 --> 00:29:17.527
I'm totally broke until next month.

00:29:18.153 --> 00:29:20.864
Jeong-bae's going to order
egg-battered fried meatballs.

00:29:20.947 --> 00:29:22.616
He's got such expensive taste.

00:29:22.699 --> 00:29:24.534
What do we do? I'm broke too.

00:29:30.332 --> 00:29:31.416
Excuse me.

00:29:32.876 --> 00:29:33.752
Yes?

00:29:34.378 --> 00:29:35.921
Can I give it a try?

00:29:36.004 --> 00:29:38.840
Have you ever played pool before?

00:29:39.383 --> 00:29:41.676
No, never.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.762
But I think I get how it works.

00:29:47.391 --> 00:29:50.060
What do we do? We're already losing.

00:29:51.186 --> 00:29:52.813
We can't make a comeback anyway.

00:29:52.896 --> 00:29:55.148
She came all this way,
so let's just let her play.

00:29:55.232 --> 00:29:57.067
Oh man.

00:30:06.493 --> 00:30:09.454
You shouldn't hold it like that.

00:30:09.538 --> 00:30:13.542
Here, do it like this. Right.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.919
Hold it like this

00:30:17.003 --> 00:30:18.630
and bend down a little.

00:30:18.713 --> 00:30:20.507
Right, just like that.

00:30:22.342 --> 00:30:24.010
- Good.
- Okay.

00:30:24.845 --> 00:30:26.138
Can I hit it now?

00:30:26.221 --> 00:30:28.807
Yeah, give it a shot.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:29.808
Here goes.

00:30:44.114 --> 00:30:46.116
How is that angle even possible?

00:30:49.161 --> 00:30:50.162
I can go again, right?

00:30:50.787 --> 00:30:52.581
Sure. Go ahead.

00:31:16.646 --> 00:31:18.064
What the…

00:31:20.484 --> 00:31:21.610
Is she a pro or something?

00:31:21.693 --> 00:31:25.363
No, she said it's her first time playing.

00:31:26.156 --> 00:31:27.741
She's so cool.

00:31:37.042 --> 00:31:39.085
- We won!
- We did it!

00:31:44.382 --> 00:31:45.675
Is it heavy?

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:47.802
A little.

00:31:47.886 --> 00:31:49.846
Think of it as a workout.
You like exercising.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.432
You have an answer for everything.

00:31:52.516 --> 00:31:54.893
Hey, aren't you going
to team training today?

00:31:54.976 --> 00:31:58.605
They called earlier
and said the practice is canceled.

00:31:58.688 --> 00:32:00.565
The team's in a bad spot right now.

00:32:01.358 --> 00:32:05.111
Coach said he'd find
a new sponsor somehow,

00:32:05.862 --> 00:32:07.781
but I don't think it's working out.

00:32:07.864 --> 00:32:09.115
Really?

00:32:10.659 --> 00:32:11.868
Since we're on the topic,

00:32:13.078 --> 00:32:15.497
you know our trip this weekend?

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.666
I don't think that's going to happen.

00:32:17.749 --> 00:32:19.125
Why not?

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.004
Well, usually for away games,
we head there a day early,

00:32:23.088 --> 00:32:26.716
stay the night,
play our match, and then come back.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.219
But since the team's broke right now,

00:32:29.302 --> 00:32:33.348
we'll have to leave at the crack of dawn
and come straight back after the game.

00:32:33.974 --> 00:32:36.351
So if you come, you'll just be exhausted,

00:32:37.102 --> 00:32:38.853
and we won't have time to hang out.

00:32:38.937 --> 00:32:42.691
So basically, it's a money problem.

00:32:43.733 --> 00:32:44.651
Yeah.

00:32:46.152 --> 00:32:47.529
We're here.

00:32:47.612 --> 00:32:49.364
OH SEASON GROCERY STORE

00:32:49.447 --> 00:32:50.323
What the…

00:32:50.407 --> 00:32:53.577
Of all places, why did it have to be here?

00:32:54.202 --> 00:32:55.245
Do you know this place?

00:32:55.954 --> 00:32:57.122
I told you yesterday.

00:32:57.205 --> 00:33:00.083
They worked me to the bone all day,
then threw me out and into debt.

00:33:00.625 --> 00:33:03.253
This is that shady store.

00:33:03.878 --> 00:33:05.005
What?

00:33:05.088 --> 00:33:07.799
I couldn't believe it
when you told me yesterday.

00:33:07.882 --> 00:33:10.594
Since when do you just let people
walk all over you?

00:33:10.677 --> 00:33:12.387
What choice did I have?
They wouldn't pay me.

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.264
Eun-ho, don't worry.

00:33:14.347 --> 00:33:17.309
I'll make sure you get paid for your work.

00:33:18.018 --> 00:33:19.936
- Really?
- Of course.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.229
What kind of people are they?

00:33:21.313 --> 00:33:24.149
Scamming you
because you don't know any better.

00:33:25.609 --> 00:33:27.360
Just wait right here.

00:33:32.449 --> 00:33:34.618
- I'd like to return this.
- Of course, sir.

00:33:34.701 --> 00:33:36.411
And I'd like to speak to the manager.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:38.788
Why do you want to speak to…

00:33:38.872 --> 00:33:40.665
Is there a problem, sir?

00:33:40.749 --> 00:33:42.626
Well, yesterday…

00:33:44.628 --> 00:33:45.837
Wait, Yeon-su?

00:33:47.547 --> 00:33:49.633
Do I know you?

00:33:49.716 --> 00:33:50.884
Well…

00:33:54.679 --> 00:33:57.766
It feels pretty reassuring
to have Si-yeol stepping up.

00:34:00.769 --> 00:34:01.853
Si-yeol!

00:34:02.354 --> 00:34:03.521
Hey, Eun-ho.

00:34:05.357 --> 00:34:06.608
Over there.

00:34:07.359 --> 00:34:09.152
What's going on here?

00:34:11.655 --> 00:34:14.282
What's going on with you two?
Since when do you two know each other?

00:34:14.366 --> 00:34:17.035
Turns out, she's an old friend
from way back.

00:34:17.661 --> 00:34:20.413
I never dreamed I'd run into her here.

00:34:21.039 --> 00:34:22.957
- An old friend?
- Yeah.

00:34:23.625 --> 00:34:26.670
How did you recognize me right away?

00:34:26.753 --> 00:34:29.422
It's been nine years.

00:34:30.006 --> 00:34:31.675
Of course I did.

00:34:31.758 --> 00:34:35.136
You really helped me out back then.

00:34:36.262 --> 00:34:38.473
Me? Helping you out?

00:34:39.891 --> 00:34:41.142
Si-yeol.

00:34:43.645 --> 00:34:47.023
You said you'd fight for me. What is this?

00:34:47.107 --> 00:34:49.693
She's the one who ripped me off.

00:34:49.776 --> 00:34:51.236
I know that,

00:34:51.319 --> 00:34:52.987
but I don't think I can help you.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.073
What?

00:34:55.156 --> 00:34:57.534
I told you, I know her well.

00:34:58.201 --> 00:34:59.494
Oh, right.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.788
We were just about to go grab lunch.

00:35:01.871 --> 00:35:03.331
You're okay with that, right?

00:35:03.873 --> 00:35:04.749
"We"?

00:35:04.833 --> 00:35:06.543
Yeah, Yeon-su and…

00:35:07.127 --> 00:35:08.336
Oh, there she is.

00:35:09.212 --> 00:35:10.588
Yeon-su!

00:35:10.672 --> 00:35:11.715
Hello.

00:35:11.798 --> 00:35:13.550
Yeah, hi.

00:35:14.759 --> 00:35:17.053
So, what should we eat?

00:35:24.561 --> 00:35:27.105
NOBLE AROM BILLIARDS CLUB

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:43.204
This is so good!

00:35:47.125 --> 00:35:48.835
You've got something right there.

00:35:48.918 --> 00:35:49.794
Do I?

00:35:58.219 --> 00:35:59.179
Hey.

00:36:00.388 --> 00:36:03.391
Try the egg-battered fried meatballs too.

00:36:03.475 --> 00:36:04.350
Okay.

00:36:05.643 --> 00:36:06.853
Thank you.

00:36:11.775 --> 00:36:13.443
This is good too.

00:36:18.114 --> 00:36:19.574
You should try this too, Beom.

00:36:20.408 --> 00:36:22.243
Oh, I have.

00:36:23.495 --> 00:36:24.621
Thank you.

00:36:28.875 --> 00:36:30.293
What is with this vibe?

00:36:31.085 --> 00:36:32.253
It's a total disaster.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.186
Eat up, Yeon-su.

00:36:48.686 --> 00:36:50.522
Yes, you too, Si-yeol.

00:36:54.067 --> 00:36:55.109
Oh, right.

00:36:55.652 --> 00:36:57.987
Don't you prefer wheat rice cakes
over regular ones?

00:36:58.696 --> 00:37:02.200
I can't tell if these are wheat rice cakes
or regular ones.

00:37:03.159 --> 00:37:05.995
How did you know what I like?

00:37:08.081 --> 00:37:09.415
Oh, that.

00:37:11.167 --> 00:37:12.919
I just figured you might.

00:37:14.712 --> 00:37:16.297
This is definitely wheat.

00:37:16.923 --> 00:37:19.259
I prefer rice cakes.

00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:20.635
That's odd.

00:37:21.511 --> 00:37:22.971
Were we that close?

00:37:24.055 --> 00:37:26.349
Even my husband doesn't know
I prefer wheat rice cakes.

00:37:27.141 --> 00:37:28.476
You're married?

00:37:29.227 --> 00:37:30.562
Of course. I have two kids.

00:37:31.563 --> 00:37:35.024
Anyway, Si-yeol,
you're still playing, right?

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:37.318
Is it okay for me to ask you that?

00:37:37.402 --> 00:37:38.945
Of course.

00:37:39.571 --> 00:37:40.655
I'm just getting by.

00:37:40.738 --> 00:37:43.575
Back then, I really thought

00:37:43.658 --> 00:37:46.369
you should've made
the youth national team.

00:37:47.287 --> 00:37:50.874
I saw so much more potential in you.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.252
Yeah, well.

00:37:54.335 --> 00:37:56.629
Things just turned out this way.

00:37:57.255 --> 00:37:58.798
But why are you working at that store?

00:37:58.882 --> 00:38:00.550
You're so talented.

00:38:01.384 --> 00:38:04.387
Talented? I'm just a middle-aged woman.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.098
No way. Yeon-su is super talented.

00:38:07.181 --> 00:38:09.434
We get foreign customers at the store,

00:38:09.517 --> 00:38:11.477
and she speaks French and German.

00:38:12.103 --> 00:38:14.606
She even negotiates all our supply prices.

00:38:14.689 --> 00:38:17.191
Sales doubled since she started working.

00:38:17.275 --> 00:38:19.944
Hye-rim, please. You're making me blush.

00:38:21.696 --> 00:38:26.451
When I was working my old job,
I thought I was the best at it.

00:38:26.993 --> 00:38:31.372
But when I got married,
had kids, and quit,

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.127
it wasn't easy to go back to work
after raising my kids.

00:38:36.753 --> 00:38:38.671
You know, a gap in my resume.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:43.843
Then, Yeon-su,

00:38:44.427 --> 00:38:46.679
could you help our team out?

00:38:48.139 --> 00:38:49.307
What?

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:52.769
Our team's in a bit of trouble,
so we need a new sponsor.

00:38:53.269 --> 00:38:54.854
Could you help us with that?

00:38:56.105 --> 00:38:58.942
It'd be a chance for you
to get back into this industry.

00:38:59.025 --> 00:39:00.652
I think it'd be good for you.

00:39:00.735 --> 00:39:04.822
You're the best
at scouting and negotiating.

00:39:07.033 --> 00:39:08.576
- I am?
- Yes.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.423
Jeez.

00:39:31.391 --> 00:39:32.767
Wait here.

00:39:33.726 --> 00:39:34.769
Yes, sir.

00:39:50.284 --> 00:39:51.327
Man.

00:39:51.995 --> 00:39:54.872
Why did you drag me out at this hour?

00:39:56.749 --> 00:39:59.585
I wouldn't sell this
for all the gold in the world.

00:40:00.211 --> 00:40:03.047
Cut the crap.
A merchant sells for the right price.

00:40:03.131 --> 00:40:05.383
I'm saying this
because this thing is cursed.

00:40:05.466 --> 00:40:10.638
It bewitches all, even spirits,
but it devours human life.

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:16.894
However, you have no life left to devour.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.646
Fine. Take it.

00:40:21.232 --> 00:40:23.067
What? Just hand it over?

00:40:23.901 --> 00:40:25.319
Yeah.

00:40:25.403 --> 00:40:27.780
You're acting like it's yours.

00:40:36.289 --> 00:40:39.500
Two billion won in cash, as agreed.

00:40:41.002 --> 00:40:42.545
Count it if you want.

00:40:43.629 --> 00:40:44.756
It's fine.

00:41:03.649 --> 00:41:06.819
It's cursed, so open it outside.

00:41:07.487 --> 00:41:09.030
Don't do it in here.

00:41:09.739 --> 00:41:10.823
Sure.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.295
- Thanks for lunch.
- Of course.

00:41:24.378 --> 00:41:26.255
I'll treat you next time, Yeon-su.

00:41:26.339 --> 00:41:28.424
I'll take you somewhere better.

00:41:29.217 --> 00:41:30.885
Sure, let's do that. How much?

00:41:31.761 --> 00:41:33.346
There won't be a next time.

00:41:33.429 --> 00:41:35.890
I'll pay, so make this
the last time you meet up.

00:41:36.516 --> 00:41:37.975
Hey, wait.

00:41:38.059 --> 00:41:38.935
You're paying?

00:41:39.018 --> 00:41:40.603
With what money?

00:41:40.686 --> 00:41:42.605
You gave me all the money
from the AC yesterday.

00:41:43.231 --> 00:41:45.149
Did I not tell you?

00:41:45.233 --> 00:41:47.193
We don't have to worry
about money anymore.

00:41:47.276 --> 00:41:48.444
What?

00:41:54.742 --> 00:41:55.618
Hey!

00:41:56.536 --> 00:41:57.745
What was that?

00:41:58.287 --> 00:41:59.455
Can't you tell?

00:41:59.539 --> 00:42:02.208
It's a no-limit credit card. A black card.

00:42:02.291 --> 00:42:05.253
I mean, where did you get it?

00:42:05.336 --> 00:42:07.004
I took it from Woo-seok.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:09.006
What?

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:11.384
Excuse me, you left this.

00:42:11.467 --> 00:42:12.802
That must be mine.

00:42:16.472 --> 00:42:18.683
- Here you go.
- A black card.

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.610
Man, why didn't I think of that sooner?

00:42:33.281 --> 00:42:35.867
Woo-seok's money is basically my money.

00:42:36.409 --> 00:42:40.163
With that card,
I'll never have to worry about money.

00:42:40.246 --> 00:42:42.707
You two seemed very friendly.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:44.167
Real sweet.

00:42:44.792 --> 00:42:45.668
What?

00:42:49.505 --> 00:42:51.299
"Eun-ho, don't worry."

00:42:51.382 --> 00:42:53.885
"I'll make sure
you get paid for your work."

00:42:54.844 --> 00:42:56.762
Then what was it you said again?

00:42:57.388 --> 00:42:59.807
"Don't you prefer wheat rice cakes
over regular ones?"

00:42:59.891 --> 00:43:04.312
"But why are you working at that store?
You're so talented."

00:43:05.646 --> 00:43:08.107
Hey, I was working there yesterday too!

00:43:09.734 --> 00:43:13.571
Eun-ho, it's not what you think.

00:43:13.654 --> 00:43:18.910
She worked me to the bone all day,
stiffed me, and treated me like dirt.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.038
How could you take her side
right in front of me?

00:43:22.121 --> 00:43:24.790
What was she again? An old friend?

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:30.004
Are you jealous right now?

00:43:30.087 --> 00:43:31.714
Well, I prefer regular rice cakes!

00:43:31.797 --> 00:43:34.425
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:43:34.508 --> 00:43:36.719
Next time, let's get rice cakes.

00:43:37.428 --> 00:43:38.554
Whatever.

00:43:39.138 --> 00:43:41.682
How do you make me feel
this petty at my age?

00:43:41.766 --> 00:43:43.267
It's pathetic.

00:43:48.314 --> 00:43:49.607
I'm sorry.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.486
I made you so upset.

00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:59.200
I'm not a child.
Coddling me won't make me feel better.

00:44:00.743 --> 00:44:02.703
I really am sorry.

00:44:03.371 --> 00:44:04.455
Okay?

00:44:06.916 --> 00:44:10.795
I just ran into Yeon-su
when I least expected it,

00:44:11.462 --> 00:44:14.674
so I was glad to see her
but also felt bad.

00:44:14.757 --> 00:44:16.008
That's why I acted that way.

00:44:16.801 --> 00:44:17.885
Okay?

00:44:19.595 --> 00:44:22.348
Why did you feel bad?

00:44:23.933 --> 00:44:25.226
Well,

00:44:25.726 --> 00:44:29.438
before my fate was switched,
Yeon-su was actually my agent.

00:44:29.522 --> 00:44:34.694
She was one of Forbes'
30 Most Influential Women.

00:44:34.777 --> 00:44:37.571
She was very successful.

00:44:38.197 --> 00:44:41.867
But now she's working a temp job
at a local grocery store.

00:44:43.119 --> 00:44:44.912
She was an agent?

00:44:45.871 --> 00:44:49.417
No wonder nothing I said worked on her.

00:44:50.001 --> 00:44:51.544
Exactly.

00:44:51.627 --> 00:44:54.380
There's a reason I gave up
on getting that money back.

00:44:55.256 --> 00:44:58.259
You just can't win an argument with her.

00:44:58.342 --> 00:45:01.053
Even top club chairmen
in the big leagues absolutely shudder

00:45:01.137 --> 00:45:05.057
when they sit down
at the negotiating table with her.

00:45:06.976 --> 00:45:12.273
So a woman that successful
had her career cut short

00:45:13.274 --> 00:45:15.818
because I switched your fate?

00:45:18.779 --> 00:45:21.324
I suppose so.

00:45:23.367 --> 00:45:26.704
She started out
as a football association employee,

00:45:26.787 --> 00:45:29.498
then met me and became an agent.

00:45:30.541 --> 00:45:32.543
Anyway, it's kind of surprising.

00:45:33.336 --> 00:45:36.630
She used to be too busy
to even meet anyone,

00:45:36.714 --> 00:45:38.758
so she never got married.

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.386
But now she suddenly has two kids.

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:48.976
Relationships often change
a person's fate.

00:45:49.727 --> 00:45:52.438
Meeting the right person
at the right time.

00:45:53.689 --> 00:45:55.858
Nothing in life is
more important than that.

00:45:59.153 --> 00:46:00.112
What?

00:46:03.157 --> 00:46:05.826
You're the only one who would call me.

00:46:14.585 --> 00:46:16.045
That's my number.

00:46:16.128 --> 00:46:18.964
Right, your phones
must've gotten mixed up.

00:46:22.343 --> 00:46:23.969
- Hello?
- Ok-sun?

00:46:24.678 --> 00:46:25.888
Where are you right now?

00:46:25.971 --> 00:46:27.765
I'll come get the phone right away.

00:46:28.516 --> 00:46:31.227
Oh, it's you, Hye-rim.

00:46:33.813 --> 00:46:36.148
What's taking her so long?

00:46:39.068 --> 00:46:40.736
Wait a second.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.280
I feel like I've seen this guy somewhere.

00:46:43.364 --> 00:46:44.407
What?

00:46:45.449 --> 00:46:46.867
Oh yeah.

00:46:47.493 --> 00:46:49.703
This guy looks kind of familiar.

00:46:52.039 --> 00:46:52.998
You too?

00:46:55.918 --> 00:46:57.002
Ok-sun!

00:47:07.763 --> 00:47:09.390
Damn, what do I do?

00:47:09.473 --> 00:47:11.100
There's no one around, right?

00:47:11.183 --> 00:47:14.019
Yes. I secretly took a company car out,

00:47:14.645 --> 00:47:17.022
- and made a mistake--
- You're lying.

00:47:20.776 --> 00:47:22.069
That man.

00:47:23.529 --> 00:47:25.698
The driver from Geumsu Group.

00:47:27.741 --> 00:47:28.993
What?

00:47:35.583 --> 00:47:37.376
A human has died.

00:47:37.918 --> 00:47:39.295
Because of you.

00:47:39.837 --> 00:47:43.215
Because you twisted human fate recklessly,

00:47:43.299 --> 00:47:47.428
someone who wasn't
supposed to die has died.

00:47:50.014 --> 00:47:51.182
Ok-sun!

00:47:53.434 --> 00:47:55.519
Who is this guy?

00:47:55.603 --> 00:47:57.104
That's my family photo.

00:47:57.188 --> 00:47:59.732
We took it a long time ago,
when Dad was still alive.

00:48:27.092 --> 00:48:29.136
I asked around,

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.889
and they say
Hye-rim's nickname is Hermione.

00:48:31.972 --> 00:48:33.224
Hermione?

00:48:34.433 --> 00:48:37.019
I don't know what that means.

00:48:37.102 --> 00:48:39.438
But apparently, she works
every part-time job around here,

00:48:40.064 --> 00:48:42.316
so all the shop owners call her that.

00:48:42.399 --> 00:48:45.486
They said it's like
she has 48 hours in a day.

00:48:47.947 --> 00:48:50.658
Just working at the grocery store
was exhausting enough.

00:48:50.741 --> 00:48:53.285
But she delivers milk in the morning,
works at a cafe before noon,

00:48:53.369 --> 00:48:55.287
and then at the grocery store
in the afternoon?

00:48:56.247 --> 00:48:57.540
That's not all.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.167
Hey, not there! Come up!

00:49:00.251 --> 00:49:01.210
Damn.

00:49:02.086 --> 00:49:04.255
I can't see!

00:49:04.338 --> 00:49:06.966
- You died because you were there.
- Oh man.

00:49:10.094 --> 00:49:12.680
She also works
at a nearby internet cafe on weekends.

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:19.270
If you work yourself to the bone now,
you'll pay for it later.

00:49:19.812 --> 00:49:22.940
Why is she working herself to death?

00:49:23.023 --> 00:49:25.651
I actually asked her about that.

00:49:33.784 --> 00:49:35.703
My dad didn't deserve to die that way,

00:49:35.786 --> 00:49:37.621
and my mom suffered
a breakdown from the shock.

00:49:37.705 --> 00:49:39.164
So I'm the breadwinner of our family.

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:43.127
Medical bills keep piling up,
and I want to finish college.

00:49:43.794 --> 00:49:46.255
So I need to save up money fast.

00:49:48.966 --> 00:49:50.801
So, what are you going to do?

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:53.137
What do you think?

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.848
You said her life
got screwed up because of me.

00:49:56.348 --> 00:49:57.558
Then I should make it right.

00:50:04.148 --> 00:50:05.566
A scholarship?

00:50:05.649 --> 00:50:08.027
But do students on leave
even get scholarships?

00:50:08.527 --> 00:50:10.613
Technically, no.

00:50:10.696 --> 00:50:15.326
But through the newly established
Eunho Scholarship Foundation,

00:50:15.409 --> 00:50:18.495
you were selected as the first recipient.

00:50:20.205 --> 00:50:23.584
I never applied for that. So how am I…

00:50:23.667 --> 00:50:27.880
You were chosen based on strict criteria,
so you don't need to worry about that.

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.299
You'll receive
full tuition until you graduate,

00:50:30.382 --> 00:50:32.176
a monthly stipend of five million won,

00:50:32.259 --> 00:50:34.428
plus an allowance
to study a language during break,

00:50:34.511 --> 00:50:38.057
and full funding
to study abroad after graduation.

00:50:39.516 --> 00:50:40.476
Why?

00:50:40.559 --> 00:50:42.227
Because you were selected.

00:50:42.311 --> 00:50:44.063
SAEGANG UNIVERSITY

00:50:46.148 --> 00:50:48.359
Thank you so much.

00:50:49.276 --> 00:50:50.486
Thank you.

00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:53.364
You think she's doing a good job
with the scholarship thing?

00:50:53.447 --> 00:50:55.491
Of course. It's not like it's hard.

00:50:55.574 --> 00:50:58.118
Fixing everything at once
would be too overwhelming,

00:50:58.202 --> 00:50:59.995
so we'll just do this much for now.

00:51:00.537 --> 00:51:03.582
Next month, we'll fix up her house
and pay her mom's hospital bills.

00:51:04.625 --> 00:51:05.876
I think we should.

00:51:05.959 --> 00:51:06.960
Yeah.

00:51:07.044 --> 00:51:11.173
If he were alive, I'm sure
he'd want to do that for his daughter.

00:51:13.008 --> 00:51:16.095
By the way,
my grandma was so happy yesterday.

00:51:17.638 --> 00:51:19.098
Oh, that.

00:51:20.557 --> 00:51:22.434
We've got money now,
so I figured I'd spend some.

00:51:22.518 --> 00:51:24.269
We always went empty-handed before.

00:51:24.353 --> 00:51:27.439
Everyone at the nursing home thinks
I married into a billionaire family.

00:51:28.148 --> 00:51:30.150
You gave gifts to everyone
at the nursing home

00:51:30.234 --> 00:51:32.653
and prepared all kinds of food.

00:51:32.736 --> 00:51:34.738
My grandma became a celebrity there.

00:51:35.864 --> 00:51:38.367
Generosity comes from a full stomach.

00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:40.828
You've got to grease the wheels a bit,

00:51:40.911 --> 00:51:42.454
so even if she loses at cards,

00:51:42.538 --> 00:51:45.082
she'll still get some money back.

00:51:46.792 --> 00:51:49.086
This is just one of those life lessons.

00:51:50.629 --> 00:51:51.964
Thank you.

00:51:52.047 --> 00:51:54.258
I hadn't even thought about that.

00:51:56.427 --> 00:51:58.303
Technically, it's all your money anyway.

00:52:00.597 --> 00:52:03.308
If she was that happy,
we can go again tomorrow.

00:52:04.977 --> 00:52:06.603
I can't tomorrow.

00:52:07.438 --> 00:52:08.522
I have an away game.

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:10.899
Right.

00:52:10.983 --> 00:52:13.902
I'll be back really quick,
so just wait a bit.

00:52:16.405 --> 00:52:18.657
What do you mean? We're going together.

00:52:18.741 --> 00:52:20.451
We agreed to travel after the game.

00:52:21.368 --> 00:52:23.120
What? That was--

00:52:23.203 --> 00:52:26.123
Wasn't it because the team was broke
that you were going early in the morning

00:52:26.206 --> 00:52:28.041
and coming back straight after the game?

00:52:28.667 --> 00:52:30.210
But we have plenty of money now.

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:32.504
Let's go on a trip.

00:52:32.588 --> 00:52:33.589
We got a black card.

00:52:48.353 --> 00:52:49.354
What is this?

00:52:50.481 --> 00:52:52.941
It's a bus. I chartered it.

00:52:54.777 --> 00:52:56.445
Coach, she's from overseas.

00:52:56.528 --> 00:52:57.946
She forgets to use honorifics.

00:52:59.573 --> 00:53:01.617
Anyway, since the away game is tomorrow,

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:04.411
wouldn't it be better
if we all head down there now?

00:53:07.623 --> 00:53:10.125
I guess that's true,

00:53:10.209 --> 00:53:14.338
but we don't have a place
for all of us to sleep.

00:53:14.421 --> 00:53:17.090
I took care of that too, so don't worry.

00:53:18.801 --> 00:53:21.470
Oh, and this.

00:53:22.513 --> 00:53:23.514
What's this?

00:53:24.223 --> 00:53:25.641
We owe you from last time.

00:53:25.724 --> 00:53:27.518
Reimbursement for the towing fee.

00:53:32.314 --> 00:53:34.900
But why are you giving me so much?

00:53:34.983 --> 00:53:36.652
I added some generous interest.

00:53:37.277 --> 00:53:39.655
Anyway, why are you all
just standing there?

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.657
Aren't we going?

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:46.745
I'm not sure what to do.

00:54:00.175 --> 00:54:01.218
Yes?

00:54:03.804 --> 00:54:05.347
What did you say?

00:54:08.141 --> 00:54:09.768
Yes, okay!

00:54:09.852 --> 00:54:12.855
Sir, can you please… pull over?

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.398
Hurry!

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:29.329
Hey, Coach!

00:54:30.163 --> 00:54:32.207
Where are you going?

00:54:32.291 --> 00:54:33.709
Right, Si-yeol.

00:54:33.792 --> 00:54:36.044
Something urgent came up.

00:54:36.128 --> 00:54:39.256
I have to go somewhere,
so you guys head down first.

00:54:39.339 --> 00:54:41.174
Then what about tomorrow's game?

00:54:41.842 --> 00:54:43.719
Well, the game…

00:54:43.802 --> 00:54:46.847
I'll handle my business
and head there at dawn or something.

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:48.432
- Just go.
- But…

00:54:48.515 --> 00:54:50.893
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

00:54:51.518 --> 00:54:52.436
But…

00:54:55.856 --> 00:54:58.066
Take charge, all right?

00:55:00.694 --> 00:55:01.737
Wait.

00:55:03.739 --> 00:55:05.198
What the heck?

00:55:23.467 --> 00:55:27.471
I called the coach, and he's on his way.

00:55:27.554 --> 00:55:29.598
Really? That's good.

00:55:38.607 --> 00:55:42.069
If you don't mind,
can I ask you something?

00:55:42.694 --> 00:55:44.905
Sure, go ahead.

00:55:44.988 --> 00:55:48.659
I admit we were looking
everywhere for sponsors,

00:55:49.368 --> 00:55:52.871
but I never expected a huge company
like yours to step up.

00:55:52.955 --> 00:55:54.998
Why would a huge conglomerate
like Geumsu Group

00:55:55.624 --> 00:55:59.211
suddenly decide to sponsor
a fourth-division soccer team?

00:55:59.836 --> 00:56:02.923
Well…

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:06.802
Because it interests me.
In more ways than one.

00:56:16.478 --> 00:56:18.480
Looks like no one's here today.

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:27.280
It seems like
they're traveling pretty far.

00:56:27.906 --> 00:56:30.617
I'll stop by home, then go follow them.

00:56:45.632 --> 00:56:47.551
Excuse me, who are you?

00:56:48.969 --> 00:56:50.554
I didn't expect to find

00:56:52.305 --> 00:56:56.143
another one hiding in a place like this.

00:57:09.281 --> 00:57:10.991
What is that?

00:57:11.074 --> 00:57:13.035
This is called a vajra bell.

00:57:14.786 --> 00:57:18.915
It channels divine energy,
so it's not meant to be used by humans.

00:57:21.752 --> 00:57:25.505
But as you see, I've devoured
countless minor spirits and deities.

00:57:26.631 --> 00:57:28.425
So, I thought

00:57:29.551 --> 00:57:31.511
I might try bewitching you with this.

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:10.675
So I'm not making that damn choice.

00:58:10.759 --> 00:58:13.887
I'll just stay by his side
and protect him forever.

00:58:16.598 --> 00:58:19.810
If the fate of a single human
is but a passing breeze,

00:58:19.893 --> 00:58:23.396
then a human life is like a raging storm.

00:58:24.272 --> 00:58:27.526
Even if you twist a single strand of fate,

00:58:27.609 --> 00:58:31.822
once the storm rises,
everyone gets swept away.

00:58:32.447 --> 00:58:36.409
Events you can neither predict nor stop
will come crashing down.

00:58:36.952 --> 00:58:41.248
Can you truly handle that for a lifetime?

00:59:01.977 --> 00:59:04.146
So this is how it ends.

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:14.614
Eun-ho.

00:59:18.326 --> 00:59:19.703
Are you okay?

01:00:02.704 --> 01:00:04.623
{\an8}SPECIAL APPEARANCE BY HONG SU-HYEON

01:00:29.105 --> 01:00:32.025
NO TAIL TO TELL

01:00:32.108 --> 01:00:35.487
{\an8}Should we just stay like this
and not go back?

01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:38.823
{\an8}If you try your best
to change things back and still can't,

01:00:38.907 --> 01:00:40.158
{\an8}I'll just accept it.

01:00:40.242 --> 01:00:43.078
{\an8}I bewitched the Seoraksan Mountain fox,
just as planned.

01:00:43.161 --> 01:00:45.956
{\an8}I heard you're just an ordinary human now.

01:00:46.039 --> 01:00:48.375
{\an8}I'm going to start by targeting
the people around you.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.752
{\an8}- Eun-ho!
- Geum-ho?

01:00:50.835 --> 01:00:53.296
{\an8}You know the thing I left with you?
My fox bead.

01:00:54.089 --> 01:00:55.382
{\an8}Where is it?

01:00:58.679 --> 01:01:00.679
