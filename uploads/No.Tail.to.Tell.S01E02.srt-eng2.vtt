WEBVTT

00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:44.066
NO TAIL TO TELL

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.685
Get off me.

00:01:19.768 --> 00:01:21.603
Sorry.

00:01:29.027 --> 00:01:30.028
{\an8}Are you…

00:01:30.862 --> 00:01:31.822
{\an8}okay?

00:01:32.447 --> 00:01:34.449
{\an8}Do I look okay to you right now?

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.743
{\an8}- Of course I'm not okay.
- I see.

00:01:39.413 --> 00:01:41.415
{\an8}By the way…

00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:48.213
{\an8}you just saw
that strange thing too, right?

00:01:51.842 --> 00:01:54.553
{\an8}It's not strange. It's mystical.

00:01:55.512 --> 00:01:59.182
{\an8}Anyway, it looks like I have
more urgent matters to attend to.

00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:00.809
{\an8}What?

00:02:01.727 --> 00:02:03.395
{\an8}I'll deal with you later.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.359
What are you doing?

00:02:10.736 --> 00:02:12.028
Damn it.

00:02:12.738 --> 00:02:14.614
Just how much spiritual power did I lose?

00:02:14.698 --> 00:02:16.908
I can't even do this all of a sudden?

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:20.495
Darn it.

00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:26.293
What's with her? Is she an actual lunatic?

00:02:29.713 --> 00:02:31.590
But why did you come to see me…

00:02:31.673 --> 00:02:35.218
WARD 22
NURSING STATION

00:02:37.304 --> 00:02:38.638
Where did she go?

00:02:43.602 --> 00:02:46.313
STORAGE ROOM

00:02:52.527 --> 00:02:53.904
Are you kidding me?

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:33.235
We need to talk.

00:03:47.624 --> 00:03:48.959
I said, we need to talk.

00:04:13.984 --> 00:04:15.443
I told you. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:18.697
I'm not that naive fox I used to be.

00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:26.621
All this wood will burn nicely.

00:04:33.587 --> 00:04:36.381
You're still wicked and irreverent.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.010
What do you think you're doing?

00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:43.471
I don't expect you to honor the deities,

00:04:43.555 --> 00:04:45.348
but you should at least be reasonable.

00:04:45.432 --> 00:04:48.268
I just lost a huge chunk
of my spiritual power.

00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:49.394
Out of the blue.

00:04:49.477 --> 00:04:52.147
But no matter how much
I think about it, I just don't get it.

00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:02.032
You've made quite a mess.

00:05:11.666 --> 00:05:15.378
Was it this iron rod
that smashed the statues,

00:05:15.462 --> 00:05:17.255
or was it you?

00:05:17.964 --> 00:05:19.299
What are you talking about?

00:05:19.382 --> 00:05:22.802
I didn't come all this way
to listen to your cryptic nonsense.

00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:24.721
Just tell me why!

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.061
I've already given you the answer.

00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:35.440
You're just being stubborn
instead of seeking the truth yourself.

00:05:35.523 --> 00:05:38.902
I'm done cultivating myself,
so go ahead and do it as much as you want.

00:05:39.527 --> 00:05:42.030
- Tell me why!
- You've sinned,

00:05:42.113 --> 00:05:44.950
so you've paid the price.

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:47.410
Don't be ridiculous.

00:05:48.036 --> 00:05:50.038
How is this an appropriate price?

00:05:50.622 --> 00:05:53.333
I said I lost a huge chunk
of my spiritual power.

00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:55.585
What did I do that was so wrong?

00:05:58.296 --> 00:05:59.631
A human has died.

00:06:00.715 --> 00:06:01.633
Because of you.

00:06:05.261 --> 00:06:06.513
What?

00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:08.556
What are you talking about?

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.893
Because you twisted human fate recklessly,

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:16.064
someone who wasn't
supposed to die has died.

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.547
EPISODE 2
THE HOUR OF TRANSFER

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.506
TRANSFER

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:43.049
1. A BIZARRE EVENT THAT DEFIES REASON

00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:45.677
2. AN ATHLETE MOVING
FROM ONE TEAM TO ANOTHER

00:06:47.053 --> 00:06:51.182
URI GARAM HOSPITAL

00:06:52.726 --> 00:06:56.396
The next bus to arrive is number 360.

00:06:58.815 --> 00:06:59.858
Hi.

00:07:04.195 --> 00:07:05.280
You…

00:07:05.363 --> 00:07:08.324
You know,
I think you'll need to make a wish.

00:07:09.492 --> 00:07:10.744
What?

00:07:17.208 --> 00:07:19.961
Hey, wait. Please stop!

00:07:20.503 --> 00:07:23.214
Oh no! That was the last bus.

00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:26.926
- Did you even hear what I said?
- Just a second.

00:07:28.053 --> 00:07:31.931
Man, that really was the last bus.
I don't even have money for a cab.

00:07:32.015 --> 00:07:34.642
- Hey.
- Seriously, hold on a second.

00:07:35.894 --> 00:07:37.353
HOME
FASTEST ROUTE: 4H 24M

00:07:37.437 --> 00:07:39.731
It takes over four hours
to walk home, jeez.

00:07:40.356 --> 00:07:41.399
Hey.

00:07:45.236 --> 00:07:46.571
Where do you live?

00:07:46.654 --> 00:07:49.157
If I take you home,
will you actually listen to me?

00:07:50.116 --> 00:07:50.992
What?

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.413
Have you heard of earth-folding?
It's similar to teleporting.

00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:59.459
Like in martial arts novels?

00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:00.585
Yeah, that.

00:08:00.668 --> 00:08:03.046
I'm telling you now
so you don't freak out.

00:08:06.549 --> 00:08:08.051
Let's go.

00:08:56.141 --> 00:08:57.809
What the heck was that?

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.936
We're in front of my house.

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:01.771
I told you it was earth-folding.

00:09:01.855 --> 00:09:03.314
I used sorcery to fold the earth.

00:09:04.023 --> 00:09:06.192
Fold… the earth?

00:09:07.402 --> 00:09:10.405
Wait, could you even travel
to Europe like this?

00:09:10.488 --> 00:09:13.533
Like to Germany and Spain?

00:09:14.784 --> 00:09:17.662
I guess not,
since they're across the ocean.

00:09:18.329 --> 00:09:19.414
Of course I can!

00:09:19.998 --> 00:09:21.332
That's not even an issue.

00:09:22.292 --> 00:09:25.378
Back in the day,
I'd wake up and go to New York for bagels,

00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:27.422
then go to France for lunch.

00:09:27.505 --> 00:09:29.382
I was a regular
at a restaurant over there.

00:09:29.465 --> 00:09:32.093
And after that,
I'd have my coffee in Italy.

00:09:33.011 --> 00:09:36.806
But after a year or two,
you get sick of it.

00:09:37.432 --> 00:09:38.766
That's insane.

00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:43.521
You know…

00:09:44.105 --> 00:09:45.565
that thing you just did.

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:47.859
Could you do it one more time?

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.072
Do I just need to hold
your hand like this?

00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:10.298
What… are you doing?

00:10:11.049 --> 00:10:12.508
Oh, I…

00:10:12.592 --> 00:10:16.012
I'm sorry, I just found it fascinating.

00:10:17.889 --> 00:10:18.806
Well…

00:10:20.016 --> 00:10:21.309
I only showed you this

00:10:21.392 --> 00:10:25.230
to make up
for embarrassing myself earlier.

00:10:25.313 --> 00:10:26.189
Okay.

00:10:29.567 --> 00:10:31.236
Anyway, that's not the point.

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:36.282
You're going to help me.

00:10:37.867 --> 00:10:40.328
It's nothing big. Just make a simple wish.

00:10:41.621 --> 00:10:42.664
A wish?

00:10:42.747 --> 00:10:47.085
Yeah. I can't just interfere
in human affairs without a human's wish.

00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:49.045
So you have to make a wish for me.

00:10:53.132 --> 00:10:57.178
You want to catch that hit-and-run driver
and make him pay, right?

00:10:59.305 --> 00:11:00.306
Hey!

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.392
Stop!

00:11:03.101 --> 00:11:04.435
I said stop!

00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:08.982
Wish for it.

00:11:09.816 --> 00:11:11.234
I'll grant it for you.

00:11:28.334 --> 00:11:29.961
No smoking in here.

00:11:34.007 --> 00:11:36.342
We could've done
this witness interview over the phone.

00:11:36.426 --> 00:11:38.594
Why drag someone so busy
all the way here?

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.597
Oh, this isn't a witness interview.

00:11:41.681 --> 00:11:44.892
Mr. Lee has just been named a suspect.

00:11:45.685 --> 00:11:46.561
Wait,

00:11:46.644 --> 00:11:49.272
the real culprit for that hit-and-run
has already turned himself in--

00:11:49.355 --> 00:11:51.190
Well, the security footage…

00:11:53.443 --> 00:11:55.236
suddenly got restored last night.

00:11:56.154 --> 00:11:58.323
Strangely, all the cameras
in that area malfunctioned,

00:11:58.406 --> 00:12:00.241
so we hadn't been able
to confirm anything.

00:12:01.242 --> 00:12:02.327
Isn't that fortunate?

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:10.877
Damn.

00:12:11.878 --> 00:12:12.837
Damn it.

00:12:16.382 --> 00:12:17.675
Okay.

00:12:28.853 --> 00:12:30.063
What the…

00:12:32.565 --> 00:12:34.817
Why aren't you showing up? Are you hiding?

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.961
Damn it.

00:12:56.005 --> 00:12:57.298
What's she doing?

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.968
After messing up a job like this,

00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:02.762
why aren't you showing up?

00:13:02.845 --> 00:13:03.763
Why?

00:13:05.056 --> 00:13:06.682
Disgusting. Shit.

00:13:06.766 --> 00:13:10.144
…SERVING THE PEOPLE, GOWON POLICE

00:13:11.604 --> 00:13:12.605
He's here! He's out!

00:13:12.688 --> 00:13:15.817
Is it true that you caused a hit-and-run
and had someone else take the fall?

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.819
Any thoughts on the added DUI allegations?

00:13:17.902 --> 00:13:21.114
Do you think this will affect
your inheritance of the Geumsu Group?

00:13:21.197 --> 00:13:22.615
Just a word, please!

00:13:22.698 --> 00:13:24.784
Just a quick word on how you're feeling?

00:13:26.869 --> 00:13:29.414
- Please give us a statement!
- Just one statement!

00:13:31.874 --> 00:13:33.709
It's really nothing, Father.

00:13:34.377 --> 00:13:36.087
I'm telling you, I can handle this.

00:13:36.921 --> 00:13:38.548
Father… Father!

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.303
Damn it, that senile old geezer.

00:13:45.263 --> 00:13:46.764
Shit.

00:13:50.143 --> 00:13:52.103
Did you take care of things last night?

00:13:52.645 --> 00:13:55.106
I took care of it
so it wouldn't cause any issues.

00:13:55.898 --> 00:13:57.483
There's no way

00:13:58.443 --> 00:14:00.736
- that they'll suddenly find Bong-chang.
- Good.

00:14:01.654 --> 00:14:04.490
If that blows up too,
I won't be able to handle it.

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:06.075
Yes, sir.

00:14:08.453 --> 00:14:10.329
Of all the damn luck…

00:14:18.337 --> 00:14:19.255
What's happening?

00:14:19.964 --> 00:14:21.466
What's… wrong with this thing?

00:14:24.051 --> 00:14:25.553
In other news,

00:14:25.636 --> 00:14:30.016
a body was found earlier today
in the mountains near Gyeonggi Province.

00:14:30.099 --> 00:14:32.852
The victim has been identified as Mr. Ko,

00:14:32.935 --> 00:14:34.937
- a chauffeur for a construction company.
- Hey!

00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:36.981
- Police are investigating…
- Is that…

00:14:37.064 --> 00:14:39.692
- …treating it as a homicide.
- That's impossible.

00:14:39.775 --> 00:14:41.903
Hey! What are you doing?

00:14:43.362 --> 00:14:45.948
- I didn't do this. I swear!
- What the hell are you saying?

00:14:46.032 --> 00:14:47.158
It was me.

00:14:47.742 --> 00:14:48.659
You.

00:14:49.243 --> 00:14:51.120
You kept summoning me earlier.

00:14:51.746 --> 00:14:53.206
Too bad for you.

00:14:53.289 --> 00:14:55.333
You can't be my client anymore.

00:14:56.292 --> 00:14:58.628
Don't tell me you did all this?

00:15:02.882 --> 00:15:04.091
Hey…

00:15:04.175 --> 00:15:07.345
Pull over, you bastard.

00:15:08.179 --> 00:15:09.972
I told you I'd pay you.

00:15:10.515 --> 00:15:14.352
- So why are you doing this to me?
- I don't want to be doing this either.

00:15:14.435 --> 00:15:15.353
But…

00:15:16.687 --> 00:15:19.065
have you ever heard
of the butterfly effect?

00:15:19.732 --> 00:15:21.234
Everyone on the left side…

00:15:21.317 --> 00:15:22.652
I helped you.

00:15:22.735 --> 00:15:27.031
And that night, you got carried away
and drove home completely wasted.

00:15:27.114 --> 00:15:29.033
Then you caused an accident.

00:15:29.116 --> 00:15:31.577
And while trying to cover it up…

00:15:33.454 --> 00:15:36.582
- How dare you…
- …you ended up killing someone.

00:15:38.626 --> 00:15:40.253
I don't really get it either,

00:15:40.336 --> 00:15:43.005
but this is
what the ones above are saying.

00:15:43.089 --> 00:15:44.048
I helped you.

00:15:44.131 --> 00:15:47.134
And because of that, someone who wasn't
supposed to die is dead.

00:15:47.218 --> 00:15:48.219
What?

00:15:48.302 --> 00:15:51.764
Don't bother trying to understand.
I don't get it either.

00:15:52.431 --> 00:15:55.268
Anyway, one has to clean up
their own messes, right?

00:15:55.351 --> 00:15:57.979
Since I started this,
I'm going to sort it out myself.

00:15:58.062 --> 00:16:00.898
And that'll help me recover
some of my lost spiritual power.

00:16:00.982 --> 00:16:02.525
That was just a mistake.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.528
No, it was an accident.

00:16:05.611 --> 00:16:07.780
From now on, you won't be able to lie.

00:16:13.661 --> 00:16:17.081
And you won't be able
to hide anything anymore.

00:16:17.707 --> 00:16:19.625
Every single wrong you've ever committed,

00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:23.963
even that pen you stole
from the stationery store as a kid,

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.340
you're going to confess to it all.

00:16:27.842 --> 00:16:28.968
Oh, right.

00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:32.930
I'll be taking this

00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:35.391
since you're no longer my client.

00:16:59.874 --> 00:17:01.459
Is he trying to say something?

00:17:03.169 --> 00:17:04.920
I want to turn myself in.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:07.506
What? Turn himself in?

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:10.259
Are you confessing
to the hit-and-run incident?

00:17:10.343 --> 00:17:12.720
It's alleged
that you attempted to switch drivers.

00:17:12.803 --> 00:17:15.473
Is there a reason
why you decided to turn yourself in?

00:17:16.098 --> 00:17:17.141
I…

00:17:21.479 --> 00:17:22.813
killed

00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:24.732
someone!

00:17:24.815 --> 00:17:26.901
- Oh my God!
- What?

00:17:30.154 --> 00:17:31.113
I can't do this.

00:17:33.658 --> 00:17:34.784
You bastard.

00:17:40.498 --> 00:17:43.125
The victim died on the spot.

00:17:43.668 --> 00:17:46.003
And to cover up the crime,

00:17:46.962 --> 00:17:49.882
I ordered the body
to be buried in the mountains.

00:17:49.965 --> 00:17:50.966
- Come quickly.
- Yes, sir!

00:17:51.676 --> 00:17:53.260
All this time,

00:17:53.344 --> 00:17:54.887
I've been building slush funds

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.473
- worth tens of billions of won…
- Hey, wait a minute!

00:17:57.556 --> 00:18:00.685
…through offshore tax evasion
using overseas subsidiaries!

00:18:00.768 --> 00:18:03.145
- Just a second!
- Was it intentional?

00:18:03.229 --> 00:18:05.648
FAIRNESS UNDER THE LAW
SERVING THE PEOPLE, GOWON POLICE

00:18:55.406 --> 00:18:56.365
This is a gift.

00:19:02.037 --> 00:19:03.456
What is this?

00:19:04.665 --> 00:19:07.209
It's a suitcase.
You'll probably need it soon.

00:19:07.918 --> 00:19:10.337
I'm sure you saw the news.
It all worked out thanks to you.

00:19:10.421 --> 00:19:13.007
I've even recovered
some of my spiritual power.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.216
Gosh…

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.011
Was that really all you?

00:19:18.345 --> 00:19:19.263
Wow.

00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:22.057
You know, I've been wondering.

00:19:22.975 --> 00:19:26.103
Who exactly… are you?

00:19:27.938 --> 00:19:29.231
You want to know my name?

00:19:31.025 --> 00:19:32.109
Well, that's too bad.

00:19:32.193 --> 00:19:34.820
I don't usually tell humans my name.

00:19:34.904 --> 00:19:36.447
No. That's not what I meant.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.992
I mean, what are you exactly?
Not your name, but what you are.

00:19:41.076 --> 00:19:41.952
Oh, that.

00:19:44.497 --> 00:19:45.372
Take a guess.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.875
Well, I'm not sure.

00:19:49.752 --> 00:19:51.045
A demon?

00:19:51.128 --> 00:19:52.254
What?

00:19:52.338 --> 00:19:53.464
- Satan?
- What?

00:19:54.924 --> 00:19:55.966
No?

00:19:57.468 --> 00:19:59.762
Try again. Think of something more Korean.

00:20:05.601 --> 00:20:06.477
Well…

00:20:12.775 --> 00:20:15.027
- A maiden ghost?
- A nine-tailed fox!

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.446
Can't you tell just by looking at me?
This beauty.

00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:20.199
And this mystique.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.285
A nine-tailed fox?

00:20:23.369 --> 00:20:25.454
Like an actual fox with nine tails…

00:20:26.121 --> 00:20:27.414
Wait!

00:20:28.165 --> 00:20:31.043
So I wasn't just seeing things back then.

00:20:32.127 --> 00:20:35.464
Yes, just like in Return of the Legend,
except I have no interest in livers.

00:20:35.548 --> 00:20:38.551
And I definitely have no interest
in becoming human.

00:20:39.176 --> 00:20:40.219
Wow.

00:20:40.302 --> 00:20:42.429
Anyway, that's not why I'm here this time.

00:20:44.223 --> 00:20:46.809
Take this. You'll need it sooner or later.

00:20:49.603 --> 00:20:50.563
What now…

00:20:50.646 --> 00:20:51.605
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

00:20:51.689 --> 00:20:53.440
Nine-tailed foxes do
this sort of thing too?

00:20:53.524 --> 00:20:54.984
Times have changed.

00:20:55.067 --> 00:20:57.403
Think of it as a business model.

00:20:57.486 --> 00:20:59.738
You're going to be quite wealthy soon.

00:20:59.822 --> 00:21:01.949
Wealthy enough to be my client.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.660
Seriously…

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.162
Are you messing with me right now?

00:21:07.788 --> 00:21:08.664
What?

00:21:08.747 --> 00:21:09.957
I mean,

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.502
last time, you called me a nobody
and told me not to dream big.

00:21:14.378 --> 00:21:16.589
You said all those mean things
about my future.

00:21:16.672 --> 00:21:17.715
What changed?

00:21:19.675 --> 00:21:21.343
Oh, that?

00:21:23.721 --> 00:21:26.223
I guess I misread things at first.

00:21:30.185 --> 00:21:33.063
Fate doesn't just change like that.

00:21:33.731 --> 00:21:35.524
Whatever, it's fine.

00:21:35.608 --> 00:21:37.860
I didn't care about what you said anyway.

00:21:38.527 --> 00:21:39.695
I told you.

00:21:39.778 --> 00:21:42.615
In a few years,
I'm going to be a really famous athlete.

00:21:44.617 --> 00:21:45.910
What I'm talking about

00:21:45.993 --> 00:21:48.329
is nothing like
your childish wishful thinking.

00:21:48.412 --> 00:21:51.081
I'm telling you
what I saw in your actual future.

00:21:53.292 --> 00:21:55.461
Whoa, it's hot! What was that?

00:21:55.544 --> 00:21:57.212
I had to show you how to use it.

00:21:57.296 --> 00:21:59.298
I'll appear whenever you burn that.

00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:02.593
Why couldn't you just say so
instead of scaring me like that?

00:22:04.011 --> 00:22:05.262
- Give it back.
- I already did.

00:22:05.346 --> 00:22:06.388
But it's gone.

00:22:07.014 --> 00:22:09.475
Well, I'll be away for a while
for personal reasons.

00:22:09.558 --> 00:22:11.060
And more importantly,

00:22:12.061 --> 00:22:15.397
it'd be annoying
if someone who's broke kept summoning me.

00:22:16.023 --> 00:22:18.192
So it'll appear naturally
when the time is right.

00:22:20.736 --> 00:22:22.696
You can go now. We're done.

00:22:26.241 --> 00:22:27.451
Seriously though…

00:22:28.202 --> 00:22:29.244
Are you really

00:22:30.162 --> 00:22:31.872
not going to tell me your name?

00:22:33.916 --> 00:22:35.167
What?

00:22:40.798 --> 00:22:42.007
Eun-ho.

00:22:43.634 --> 00:22:44.760
My name is Eun-ho.

00:22:50.391 --> 00:22:53.268
You should feel honored.
I don't tell just anyone.

00:22:55.145 --> 00:22:56.105
I see.

00:22:57.189 --> 00:22:58.816
Eun-ho.

00:23:08.701 --> 00:23:09.618
Kang Si-yeol?

00:23:14.289 --> 00:23:15.541
You must be tired.

00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:19.420
I'm Hong Yeon-su,
Team Leader at the Soccer Association.

00:23:19.503 --> 00:23:20.379
Remember me?

00:23:21.547 --> 00:23:23.173
Oh, right.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.011
It's nice to see you.

00:23:32.766 --> 00:23:34.560
Did you already hear the news?

00:23:35.394 --> 00:23:36.520
Pardon?

00:23:36.603 --> 00:23:40.733
You've been selected
for the youth national team.

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:44.945
Me? On the national team?

00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:46.363
Do you have a passport?

00:23:46.447 --> 00:23:48.574
You have to leave next week
for overseas training.

00:23:48.657 --> 00:23:50.242
Wait a second.

00:23:50.868 --> 00:23:52.453
Why am I all of a sudden…

00:23:53.078 --> 00:23:55.664
I guess you haven't heard the news yet.

00:23:56.373 --> 00:23:59.710
You're a replacement for Hyeon Woo-seok.

00:23:59.793 --> 00:24:02.087
As you know, Hyeon Woo-seok is injured,

00:24:02.171 --> 00:24:04.923
so there's no clear starter
for that position right now.

00:24:06.717 --> 00:24:07.801
I see.

00:24:07.885 --> 00:24:09.470
Be prepared. I'll see you then.

00:24:09.553 --> 00:24:10.596
You realize

00:24:10.679 --> 00:24:14.683
this is a big opportunity for you, right?

00:24:42.377 --> 00:24:44.671
- Are you okay?
- Of course.

00:24:44.755 --> 00:24:48.926
My face is everything to me,
and I'm scar-free and still handsome.

00:24:50.385 --> 00:24:51.512
Whatever.

00:24:53.347 --> 00:24:55.474
How long will rehab take?

00:24:56.809 --> 00:24:59.520
I don't know. Maybe about a year.

00:25:02.523 --> 00:25:04.817
Hey, whatever you do, don't get injured.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.694
This rehab stuff is brutal.

00:25:09.947 --> 00:25:10.823
After rehab,

00:25:12.032 --> 00:25:14.159
you'll still be able to play, right?

00:25:14.785 --> 00:25:15.786
Of course.

00:25:17.663 --> 00:25:19.623
What else would I do besides soccer?

00:25:20.249 --> 00:25:25.045
Don't worry about me.
Just go and do your best, you punk.

00:25:25.671 --> 00:25:27.881
Finish your rehab
and get back as soon as you can.

00:25:27.965 --> 00:25:30.217
A year on your ass in rehab?
Total overkill.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.552
"My ass"?

00:25:31.635 --> 00:25:34.805
Fine. I'll be back in exactly six months.

00:25:36.431 --> 00:25:37.641
Until then,

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.270
keep my spot warm
till I'm back, all right?

00:25:42.187 --> 00:25:43.939
Whatever, man.

00:25:44.439 --> 00:25:47.109
Hey, I came up with a new move.

00:25:49.653 --> 00:25:52.197
Since I'm right-footed,
it doesn't matter if my left gets injured.

00:25:52.281 --> 00:25:54.116
So, if I do it like this…

00:25:54.199 --> 00:25:55.617
Yeah, real good.

00:26:01.373 --> 00:26:02.833
Kang Si-yeol?

00:26:05.252 --> 00:26:06.336
Hello.

00:26:25.105 --> 00:26:28.442
{\an8}NINE YEARS LATER

00:26:41.955 --> 00:26:43.373
What do you think?

00:26:46.668 --> 00:26:48.378
It's nice. I like it.

00:26:48.462 --> 00:26:49.630
Right?

00:26:50.881 --> 00:26:53.759
Islands like this
rarely come on the market.

00:26:53.842 --> 00:26:55.302
And it can also be developed.

00:26:56.053 --> 00:26:58.096
So, if you build a few villas over there

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.098
and bring in tourists--

00:27:00.182 --> 00:27:03.185
No need.
I'll be the only one using this island.

00:27:03.268 --> 00:27:04.353
Pardon?

00:27:04.436 --> 00:27:07.814
I'm going to turn this whole island
into my private retreat.

00:27:08.482 --> 00:27:09.608
I see.

00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:12.361
But if you're the only one
using such a large island,

00:27:12.444 --> 00:27:14.696
how do you plan
on traveling back and forth?

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.574
If a typhoon hits,
you'll be stranded all by yourself.

00:27:17.658 --> 00:27:20.327
I won't be traveling by boat,
so you don't need to worry.

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:22.788
Anyway, how much was it again?

00:27:22.871 --> 00:27:25.207
Right. It's 12 billion won.

00:27:26.541 --> 00:27:28.794
It is a high-end property,

00:27:28.877 --> 00:27:32.464
but with a bit of negotiation,
we could maybe get it down to 11 billion.

00:27:33.465 --> 00:27:35.008
Forget it. It's just a billion won.

00:27:35.092 --> 00:27:37.844
What's the point of haggling
over pocket change?

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:41.723
Go check. The money should be in.

00:27:42.808 --> 00:27:44.184
Okay, sure.

00:27:51.942 --> 00:27:52.943
Excuse me.

00:27:53.527 --> 00:27:56.029
Not a single won has come in.

00:27:57.739 --> 00:27:58.824
What?

00:27:59.616 --> 00:28:00.617
Hold on.

00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:03.704
Does that mean
I don't even have 12 billion won left?

00:28:03.787 --> 00:28:05.622
Just because I took a few years off?

00:28:06.498 --> 00:28:08.250
What would you like to do?

00:28:09.501 --> 00:28:12.296
Give me time. I know I can get the money.

00:28:15.632 --> 00:28:16.550
But…

00:28:17.968 --> 00:28:20.887
can't you make it
a clean 10 billion instead of 11?

00:32:12.035 --> 00:32:14.496
Premier League star Kang Si-yeol

00:32:14.579 --> 00:32:18.250
signed a massive contract extension
with Thames FC today.

00:32:18.333 --> 00:32:20.585
Thames FC announced through their website

00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:24.422
that they successfully
re-signed Kang Si-yeol.

00:32:24.506 --> 00:32:27.008
They expressed great joy and gratitude

00:32:27.092 --> 00:32:29.636
for being able to continue

00:32:29.719 --> 00:32:32.931
their journey with their team leader
and franchise star.

00:32:33.014 --> 00:32:35.600
Kang Si-yeol's new contract
will last for five years,

00:32:35.684 --> 00:32:38.728
making him one
of the highest-paid players in the league.

00:32:38.812 --> 00:32:41.106
Becoming the first Asian player

00:32:41.189 --> 00:32:44.025
to lead the league
in both goals and assists,

00:32:44.109 --> 00:32:46.653
Kang Si-yeol achieved
a career high last season.

00:32:46.736 --> 00:32:51.950
This sparked speculation
and media reports about his next transfer.

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:54.077
Amid the growing interest,

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:58.373
international media outlets rushed
to report on his contract renewal.

00:32:58.915 --> 00:33:02.627
Officials from several clubs
that had pursued Kang Si-yeol

00:33:02.711 --> 00:33:06.423
have expressed their disappointment
following the news.

00:33:06.506 --> 00:33:09.467
As Kang Si-yeol has emerged
as a global sports star

00:33:09.551 --> 00:33:10.844
beyond South Korea,

00:33:10.927 --> 00:33:16.600
soccer fans around the world
are eagerly awaiting his next move.

00:33:30.071 --> 00:33:35.619
NICHOLAS: HEART OF VICTORY

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.143
Do you know what time it is?
Why are you still in bed?

00:34:05.815 --> 00:34:08.443
It's time you started living
like a normal person!

00:34:09.694 --> 00:34:11.321
Seriously, it's just soccer.

00:34:11.946 --> 00:34:14.574
Just because you quit
doesn't mean your life is over.

00:34:16.201 --> 00:34:19.120
Don't try to stop me.
I'm throwing all this out today.

00:34:27.754 --> 00:34:29.255
OUR ETERNAL LEGEND
COACH CHA BUM-KUN

00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:32.967
This is the Cha Bum-kun Soccer Award.
Why would you throw it away, you crazy…

00:34:39.015 --> 00:34:40.225
There's more inside.

00:34:52.278 --> 00:34:59.244
HYEON WOO-SEOK

00:35:09.587 --> 00:35:10.880
You don't…

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.300
have to throw all of them away.

00:35:42.495 --> 00:35:43.538
I'm sorry.

00:35:47.876 --> 00:35:48.752
About what?

00:35:52.088 --> 00:35:53.715
For not succeeding like Si-yeol.

00:35:58.803 --> 00:36:01.347
You never know how life will turn out.

00:36:02.015 --> 00:36:04.934
You were better than Si-yeol
when you were younger.

00:36:08.688 --> 00:36:09.814
For now,

00:36:11.149 --> 00:36:12.400
he might be on top.

00:36:13.234 --> 00:36:16.029
But you never know
what could happen in 10 or 20 years.

00:36:17.697 --> 00:36:20.742
It all depends
on how you live from now on.

00:36:48.728 --> 00:36:49.896
Is it…

00:36:51.773 --> 00:36:52.816
raining outside?

00:37:41.197 --> 00:37:42.407
I guess

00:37:43.491 --> 00:37:45.201
we still need more time.

00:37:46.578 --> 00:37:48.788
You and I both.

00:37:54.961 --> 00:37:58.882
{\an8}KANG SI-YEOL'S TOP PICK

00:38:00.466 --> 00:38:01.593
Welcome.

00:38:08.516 --> 00:38:10.310
KANG SI-YEOL'S CHOCOLATE BAR OF CHOICE

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.361
He's basically raking in money.

00:38:23.281 --> 00:38:26.117
Oh my gosh!
I finally found the Kang Si-yeol bun.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.911
- Which sticker's inside? Check.
- Inside?

00:38:27.994 --> 00:38:29.162
I can't really see it.

00:38:29.245 --> 00:38:30.288
Hey.

00:38:30.788 --> 00:38:31.748
Yes?

00:38:32.624 --> 00:38:34.584
I grabbed it first.

00:38:34.667 --> 00:38:36.878
I had to hit five convenience stores
just to find it.

00:38:36.961 --> 00:38:38.379
No, that's not it.

00:38:38.463 --> 00:38:40.882
Do you guys know a lot about Kang Si-yeol?

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.010
LIMITED EDITION BUN

00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:51.184
What is all this?

00:38:51.893 --> 00:38:54.020
It's all Si-yeol's merch. So cute, right?

00:38:55.647 --> 00:38:59.150
This is a fan club item
made to celebrate Si-yeol's Golden Boot.

00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:00.735
- And this--
- Enough of that!

00:39:01.653 --> 00:39:03.738
There's only one thing I'm curious about.

00:39:04.739 --> 00:39:06.199
Kang Si-yeol.

00:39:07.158 --> 00:39:08.701
How much does he really make?

00:39:08.785 --> 00:39:10.870
Didn't you see the recent articles?

00:39:11.496 --> 00:39:13.414
Apparently,
he makes 500 million won a week.

00:39:13.498 --> 00:39:15.917
And he's in tons of commercials.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.336
I heard he gets paid
over a billion won for each one.

00:39:18.419 --> 00:39:19.420
Really?

00:39:21.339 --> 00:39:25.843
Then that means he's finally
successful enough to be my client.

00:39:36.521 --> 00:39:38.106
What the heck is this?

00:39:42.819 --> 00:39:44.821
{\an8}I AM KANG SI-YEOL
WRITTEN BY KANG SI-YEOL

00:39:44.904 --> 00:39:46.906
An autobiography?

00:39:53.538 --> 00:39:55.873
How many times
are you going to read that?

00:39:55.957 --> 00:39:56.916
What?

00:39:58.084 --> 00:39:59.544
It's a good book.

00:40:01.629 --> 00:40:03.589
I've never read a book

00:40:03.673 --> 00:40:06.092
that resonated with me
quite like this one.

00:40:07.885 --> 00:40:10.888
That's because
it's the only book you've ever read.

00:40:10.972 --> 00:40:12.640
{\an8}I AM KANG SI-YEOL

00:40:14.475 --> 00:40:16.728
That's because everything is in here.

00:40:16.811 --> 00:40:18.396
The hardships of my youth.

00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:22.984
My constant effort, discipline,
and patience to overcome those hardships.

00:40:23.067 --> 00:40:25.319
Only to be met by inevitable despair.

00:40:26.696 --> 00:40:29.407
Despite the endless
resentment and jealousy,

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:32.118
I rose above every limit to achieve

00:40:32.744 --> 00:40:33.870
dazzling success.

00:40:35.496 --> 00:40:37.457
All of that fits in a single book?

00:40:38.666 --> 00:40:41.753
Yeon-su, do you know
what the theme of this book really is?

00:40:41.836 --> 00:40:43.004
"I'm the best."

00:40:46.841 --> 00:40:50.011
"There may be arrogance,
but never complacency."

00:40:53.139 --> 00:40:55.641
I'm so proud that I am me.

00:40:56.768 --> 00:41:00.104
Yeah, and I'm also proud of myself

00:41:00.188 --> 00:41:02.940
for being your agent all this time.

00:41:03.816 --> 00:41:05.193
I really am handsome.

00:41:07.445 --> 00:41:08.946
Put it down already.

00:41:12.909 --> 00:41:14.911
KANG SI-YEOL IS KILLING IT ON THE FIELD!

00:41:14.994 --> 00:41:16.871
- Kang Si-yeol!
- Kang Si-yeol!

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.210
HOLD YOUR BREATH
AND FALL FOR SI-YEOL

00:41:22.293 --> 00:41:23.878
- Wow, he's signing!
- Please sign mine too!

00:41:23.961 --> 00:41:25.379
KANG SI-YEOL IS SEXY…

00:41:31.427 --> 00:41:32.845
Thank you.

00:41:35.807 --> 00:41:37.391
Long time no see, Si-yeol.

00:41:44.607 --> 00:41:45.775
Excuse me…

00:41:47.318 --> 00:41:49.070
Where would you like me to sign?

00:41:51.364 --> 00:41:52.615
What?

00:41:52.698 --> 00:41:53.783
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:42:01.707 --> 00:42:03.000
Thank you.

00:42:24.188 --> 00:42:25.064
Wait…

00:42:26.399 --> 00:42:29.193
Did he seriously not recognize me?

00:42:49.714 --> 00:42:51.591
Excuse me, your suitcase is open!

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:06.981
Excuse me, what are you doing--

00:43:07.064 --> 00:43:09.942
Since you went ahead
and signed my back without asking,

00:43:10.026 --> 00:43:11.360
I'm returning the favor.

00:43:24.081 --> 00:43:25.249
What's with that woman?

00:43:28.836 --> 00:43:30.713
INCHEON AIRPORT GOES WILD FOR KANG SI-YEOL

00:43:33.633 --> 00:43:35.760
DAEHEUNG CITIZENS FC OPEN TRYOUTS

00:43:35.885 --> 00:43:36.969
Keep running!

00:43:40.681 --> 00:43:42.600
Hey, Woo-seok.

00:43:44.185 --> 00:43:45.436
Hello, Coach.

00:43:45.519 --> 00:43:46.729
Yeah, hi.

00:43:47.813 --> 00:43:48.981
What are you doing here?

00:43:50.858 --> 00:43:51.734
Well…

00:43:56.864 --> 00:43:59.575
Wait, you're not here
for the tryouts, are you?

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.331
WOW, DAEHEUNG CITIZENS SOCCER CLUB
LET'S MAKE HISTORY!

00:44:05.414 --> 00:44:07.500
- Here, Woo-seok.
- Thank you.

00:44:08.709 --> 00:44:09.961
You need to stir it.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.803
Woo-seok, why are you doing this?

00:44:18.886 --> 00:44:22.431
You were cut from this team
not too long ago.

00:44:22.515 --> 00:44:26.185
And you're back for an open tryout?
You really think that's going to work?

00:44:27.645 --> 00:44:29.981
Please just give me a fair chance, Coach.

00:44:30.815 --> 00:44:32.400
I've still got it.

00:44:32.483 --> 00:44:34.694
I took a few months off
and got my head straight--

00:44:34.777 --> 00:44:37.029
Do you think I don't know
how good you are?

00:44:37.113 --> 00:44:38.823
I coached you for years.

00:44:38.906 --> 00:44:42.201
This is the K4 League, kid.
It's the fourth division.

00:44:42.285 --> 00:44:44.578
Didn't you see how young those kids are?

00:44:44.662 --> 00:44:47.540
And you? How old are you now?

00:44:55.381 --> 00:45:00.261
Hey, the club says they won't
even offer you a paid contract

00:45:00.344 --> 00:45:02.680
because you'd be too expensive.

00:45:03.347 --> 00:45:06.934
More than anything,
playing here for a few more years

00:45:07.018 --> 00:45:08.769
won't change a thing for you.

00:45:09.478 --> 00:45:12.732
Shouldn't you look for something else
while you're still young?

00:45:15.192 --> 00:45:19.363
What, you think training here a bit more
is going to get you into the K League?

00:45:19.447 --> 00:45:20.781
Or even the national team?

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:29.248
COACH'S OFFICE

00:45:41.594 --> 00:45:42.928
I'm in Korea right now.

00:45:43.012 --> 00:45:45.806
If you're free later,
do you want to meet at our usual spot?

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:47.475
SI-YEOL

00:45:47.558 --> 00:45:49.226
What are you doing? Busy?

00:45:58.152 --> 00:45:59.445
Yeah.

00:46:01.322 --> 00:46:02.782
What am I doing?

00:46:20.883 --> 00:46:22.301
SI-YEOL

00:46:22.385 --> 00:46:25.012
Hey, I'm still waiting.

00:46:33.938 --> 00:46:36.399
Seriously, he should at least reply.

00:46:50.246 --> 00:46:55.042
DELIVERY KING

00:46:56.001 --> 00:46:56.961
As you requested,

00:46:57.044 --> 00:46:59.588
we've designed it based on
a private theme park concept.

00:47:00.339 --> 00:47:02.258
But if we do this,
the costs will skyrocket--

00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:04.844
Don't worry about the money.

00:47:04.927 --> 00:47:06.679
A huge sum is coming my way soon.

00:47:07.388 --> 00:47:08.764
Hold on. Stop there.

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:11.725
Are those the only
dining chairs they have?

00:47:12.226 --> 00:47:16.689
I need a luxurious chair,
worthy of a high-end mansion…

00:47:18.607 --> 00:47:20.151
Maybe I should make one.

00:47:23.737 --> 00:47:26.991
You signed up
for the workshop today, right?

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:30.661
Yeah, I did.
I've done a lot of things in my time.

00:47:31.412 --> 00:47:34.248
But I've never tried woodworking,
so I wanted to give it a go.

00:47:34.331 --> 00:47:36.167
Oh, I see.

00:47:36.667 --> 00:47:38.878
Since it's your first time,

00:47:38.961 --> 00:47:41.839
how about a cutting board or a trivet?

00:47:42.339 --> 00:47:43.674
A trivet? Please.

00:47:44.341 --> 00:47:45.676
I'm going to make a chair.

00:47:47.887 --> 00:47:50.055
Not a boring chair like that one.

00:47:50.639 --> 00:47:52.641
A chair that perfectly fits
the curves of my body

00:47:52.725 --> 00:47:57.062
and wraps me in comfort
while looking elegant and refined.

00:47:57.146 --> 00:47:58.939
A chair that's like a work of art.

00:47:59.982 --> 00:48:03.402
It's not as easy as it looks.

00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:05.821
It's not as easy as it looks.

00:48:05.905 --> 00:48:09.200
So, use holds of the same color,
and at the top--

00:48:09.283 --> 00:48:10.826
But that is too easy.

00:48:13.412 --> 00:48:15.206
I'm going to climb that one.

00:48:18.209 --> 00:48:19.502
- Wow.
- She's fearless.

00:48:21.879 --> 00:48:24.298
This is way too easy.

00:48:26.133 --> 00:48:27.676
What's so fun about this?

00:48:28.427 --> 00:48:31.222
Look at her go.
She doesn't seem scared at all.

00:48:36.268 --> 00:48:38.062
- What was that?
- She practically flew!

00:48:38.145 --> 00:48:40.105
- How is that possible?
- She flew!

00:48:46.654 --> 00:48:47.863
You're going to do what?

00:48:47.947 --> 00:48:49.949
I'm thinking of putting together
an idol group.

00:48:50.032 --> 00:48:51.909
K-pop is all the rage these days.

00:49:01.544 --> 00:49:05.172
Gosh, you created the group FOX9?

00:49:06.757 --> 00:49:10.261
It's not "FOX9." It's F.O.X.9!

00:49:10.928 --> 00:49:12.221
Don't be so out of touch.

00:49:13.597 --> 00:49:17.142
Anyway, hitting number one once
really went to their heads.

00:49:17.226 --> 00:49:18.561
So I quit that too.

00:49:22.606 --> 00:49:24.316
Anyway, I'm all set.

00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:26.652
So, what do I do now?

00:49:34.285 --> 00:49:36.870
Shall we try again from the beginning?

00:49:43.043 --> 00:49:44.128
I did it!

00:49:44.211 --> 00:49:48.215
My gosh, I think I have a talent
for woodworking too.

00:49:48.299 --> 00:49:49.883
Well, now that you've finished one leg,

00:49:49.967 --> 00:49:52.469
shall we try making the other three?

00:49:55.347 --> 00:49:57.057
You want me to do more sawing?

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:00.936
Excuse me.

00:50:30.883 --> 00:50:32.676
The chair's almost finished,

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.887
and he still hasn't summoned me?

00:50:35.679 --> 00:50:38.098
I even made sure
the business card appeared.

00:50:49.652 --> 00:50:50.527
{\an8}START

00:51:08.087 --> 00:51:09.213
Man, it's freezing.

00:51:14.134 --> 00:51:16.845
My muscles are recovering.

00:51:18.681 --> 00:51:20.015
- What's that?
- Jeez!

00:51:20.099 --> 00:51:21.642
Gosh, that's cold!

00:51:24.103 --> 00:51:25.479
You again.

00:51:30.567 --> 00:51:31.610
Who are you?

00:51:32.653 --> 00:51:33.779
How did you get in here?

00:51:34.613 --> 00:51:37.950
Why don't you come out?
I'm here on business.

00:51:38.033 --> 00:51:40.327
No, I can't exactly come out right now…

00:51:42.079 --> 00:51:44.790
Wait, you can't just barge
into someone's house.

00:51:44.873 --> 00:51:46.500
Are you one of my fans?

00:51:46.583 --> 00:51:49.837
Even if you are, this is still a crime.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.547
Then report me.

00:51:52.172 --> 00:51:54.216
- What?
- I said, go ahead and report me.

00:52:02.099 --> 00:52:02.975
Look…

00:52:03.892 --> 00:52:05.185
I won't report you.

00:52:05.978 --> 00:52:07.896
So could you just toss me
that towel over there?

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.314
I need it to get out.

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:10.899
No.

00:52:10.983 --> 00:52:14.111
On second thought, this is fine.
So you can just listen from there.

00:52:14.194 --> 00:52:16.739
Come on. Just toss it to me!

00:52:16.822 --> 00:52:17.948
Hey, you.

00:52:18.699 --> 00:52:19.992
Do you really not remember me?

00:52:20.075 --> 00:52:22.953
How should I know who you are?

00:52:25.873 --> 00:52:26.874
Wait a minute.

00:52:27.916 --> 00:52:31.420
Actually, you do look a bit familiar.

00:52:36.633 --> 00:52:37.718
Hey!

00:52:41.013 --> 00:52:44.433
Do you remember me now?
Long time no see, Si-yeol.

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:52.107
Congratulations. Today is the day.

00:52:52.191 --> 00:52:55.027
The day you've been waiting
and hoping for.

00:52:55.944 --> 00:52:56.945
Pardon?

00:52:58.655 --> 00:53:00.115
You've become quite wealthy.

00:53:00.199 --> 00:53:01.158
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

00:53:01.241 --> 00:53:03.994
Which means you're finally eligible
to be one of my clients.

00:53:04.077 --> 00:53:05.037
Tell me. Whatever it is.

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.246
What's your wish?

00:53:08.207 --> 00:53:09.708
- Well--
- Wait.

00:53:09.792 --> 00:53:12.628
For the record, you should
choose your wish very carefully.

00:53:12.711 --> 00:53:15.214
Because my fee
is going to be extremely high.

00:53:21.804 --> 00:53:23.722
But I don't have one.

00:53:24.389 --> 00:53:26.850
- What?
- I don't have any wishes.

00:53:33.774 --> 00:53:36.985
I don't think
you quite understand the situation.

00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:38.779
This is an incredible opportunity.

00:53:38.862 --> 00:53:42.282
Any human would be dying
to ask me for a wish.

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:46.245
I like my life the way it is.
There's nothing I want to change.

00:53:48.747 --> 00:53:50.916
Didn't you miss out
on that undefeated title or whatever?

00:53:50.999 --> 00:53:52.459
I can make that happen for you.

00:53:53.919 --> 00:53:58.173
What's the point of that?
What matters is doing it myself.

00:53:58.257 --> 00:54:01.885
Really? That's unexpected.
I didn't take you for that type.

00:54:01.969 --> 00:54:04.346
But I can do much more than just that.

00:54:04.429 --> 00:54:06.765
For example…

00:54:06.849 --> 00:54:10.143
I can change your body
to what it was when you were 20.

00:54:11.895 --> 00:54:15.482
Perhaps you didn't get
a good look at me earlier.

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:20.529
I had a checkup recently,
and my biological age is 21.

00:54:21.655 --> 00:54:23.073
What about your parents?

00:54:23.156 --> 00:54:24.783
Are they suffering from any illnesses?

00:54:24.867 --> 00:54:28.579
Once humans reach that age,
something inevitably starts to break down.

00:54:28.662 --> 00:54:29.955
I can heal them for you.

00:54:31.081 --> 00:54:32.666
I was raised by my grandmother.

00:54:32.749 --> 00:54:35.252
My parents passed away when I was young.

00:54:35.335 --> 00:54:36.545
Your grandmother, then!

00:54:37.212 --> 00:54:38.964
Aren't you worried about her health?

00:54:39.047 --> 00:54:41.466
She passed away a few years ago.

00:54:44.261 --> 00:54:45.888
Well, that's quite… unfortunate.

00:54:49.099 --> 00:54:50.684
Anyway, think about it.

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:53.395
You might not want anything right now,

00:54:54.271 --> 00:54:55.272
but life is long.

00:54:56.189 --> 00:54:57.816
You may not know it,

00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.235
but human life is very fragile.

00:55:00.903 --> 00:55:04.072
It can be shattered so easily
by even the smallest of things.

00:55:05.908 --> 00:55:06.992
When that happens…

00:55:08.243 --> 00:55:09.870
you'll be needing my help.

00:55:24.301 --> 00:55:25.385
She's still the same.

00:55:26.094 --> 00:55:28.513
She comes and goes as she pleases.

00:55:29.806 --> 00:55:31.516
Back when my life was whole,

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:33.477
and everything was in its place…

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.190
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

00:55:40.776 --> 00:55:41.777
Woo-seok.

00:55:45.238 --> 00:55:48.033
I didn't know then.

00:55:48.825 --> 00:55:52.996
Ms. Hong! We've got a problem.
You need to see this.

00:55:56.959 --> 00:55:59.628
I didn't know
just how fragile human life is

00:56:00.671 --> 00:56:02.547
and how easily it can shatter.

00:56:08.887 --> 00:56:12.057
I just got back today,
so I don't really have anything to offer.

00:56:12.766 --> 00:56:15.477
It's fine. I have to get going soon.

00:56:16.645 --> 00:56:19.314
Hey, man. What's going on with you?

00:56:22.609 --> 00:56:23.485
Well…

00:56:24.486 --> 00:56:25.445
I…

00:56:26.363 --> 00:56:27.322
I quit soccer.

00:56:28.073 --> 00:56:29.866
- What?
- Why are you so surprised?

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:31.159
We aren't the same.

00:56:34.663 --> 00:56:37.708
It wouldn't have been a surprise
if I'd quit at any point.

00:56:38.375 --> 00:56:40.002
Wait, you quit?

00:56:40.711 --> 00:56:42.587
What, did you retire? When?

00:56:42.671 --> 00:56:43.880
No, it's just…

00:56:45.298 --> 00:56:46.299
It's been a few months.

00:56:47.634 --> 00:56:48.677
And…

00:56:49.594 --> 00:56:50.887
I didn't retire. I was cut.

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.306
Hey, why didn't you tell me?

00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:54.850
It's embarrassing.

00:56:54.933 --> 00:56:57.060
How could I tell you something like that?

00:56:57.144 --> 00:56:58.770
And what would that have changed?

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.482
We…

00:57:04.026 --> 00:57:05.444
live in different worlds now,

00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:08.905
and worry about different things.

00:57:10.282 --> 00:57:12.492
How could you say that?

00:57:12.576 --> 00:57:14.745
Is that all our friendship means to you?

00:57:18.415 --> 00:57:20.083
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

00:57:20.208 --> 00:57:21.543
Anyway,

00:57:22.294 --> 00:57:23.378
what's this?

00:57:23.879 --> 00:57:24.838
Oh, that.

00:57:26.798 --> 00:57:27.674
Hey, Woo-seok.

00:57:28.425 --> 00:57:29.634
By any chance,

00:57:31.303 --> 00:57:32.304
do you have a wish?

00:57:34.389 --> 00:57:37.350
I have regretted this moment

00:57:38.477 --> 00:57:39.561
for a very long time.

00:58:09.674 --> 00:58:10.675
What the…

00:58:15.555 --> 00:58:16.640
Here.

00:58:17.224 --> 00:58:19.726
You dropped this, Mr. Hyeon.

00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:20.936
Oh, I see.

00:58:23.271 --> 00:58:24.731
But how do you know my name?

00:58:25.398 --> 00:58:30.487
Of course I know you.
Everyone in Korea knows who you are.

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:31.446
Right.

00:58:31.530 --> 00:58:32.656
Wait, what?

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:34.658
What do you mean…

00:58:36.076 --> 00:58:36.993
Excuse me?

00:58:55.137 --> 00:58:56.096
What the…

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.147
Where am I?

00:59:35.719 --> 00:59:36.845
FOREVER CARE NURSING HOME

00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:38.138
What is this?

00:59:40.056 --> 00:59:41.433
KANG SI-YEOL

00:59:43.852 --> 00:59:45.395
Did you sleep well, Si-yeol?

00:59:46.021 --> 00:59:47.856
What's going on right now?

00:59:47.939 --> 00:59:49.733
What happened?

00:59:50.275 --> 00:59:51.276
Why am I suddenly here?

00:59:52.027 --> 00:59:54.529
You made a wish, so a price must be paid.

00:59:54.613 --> 00:59:55.530
What?

00:59:56.364 --> 00:59:58.200
Wait, what does Woo-seok's wish
have to do--

00:59:58.283 --> 00:59:59.993
Didn't I tell you?

01:00:00.076 --> 01:00:02.704
I can grant the wish,
but how I do it is up to me.

01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:06.249
Once again, your wish has been granted.

01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:53.129
NO TAIL TO TELL

01:00:53.213 --> 01:00:55.507
{\an8}Who are you people? What is this?

01:00:55.590 --> 01:00:58.551
{\an8}Since someone became
a world-class soccer player,

01:00:58.635 --> 01:01:02.222
{\an8}someone else must step down
to maintain the balance.

01:01:02.305 --> 01:01:04.808
{\an8}- Are you kidding me? You…
- I have only one principle.

01:01:04.891 --> 01:01:07.852
{\an8}I avoid doing even the smallest good deed
and only avoid doing major misdeeds.

01:01:07.936 --> 01:01:10.230
{\an8}Just do it.
Unless it's beyond your capability.

01:01:10.313 --> 01:01:12.315
{\an8}Fine. And of course, you'll pay the price.

01:01:12.399 --> 01:01:14.234
{\an8}There's a story
behind this object, isn't there?

01:01:14.317 --> 01:01:18.405
{\an8}Eun-ho, I have a wish.
Could you grant it for me?

01:01:19.155 --> 01:01:21.658
{\an8}When you get out, let's do a job together.

01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:25.328
{\an8}Starting now, I'm going on a fox hunt.

01:01:27.706 --> 01:01:29.708
