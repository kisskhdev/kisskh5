This is it.

00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:37.597
I can't die like this.

00:02:37.597 --> 00:02:39.850
I finally...

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.103
I finally want to live...

[Episode 1]

00:03:03.273 --> 00:03:06.585
The Seoul City Council has passed
its 18th ordinance of 2035, aimed at

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:08.879
improving urban aesthetics
and public safety

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.646
by removing homeless people from the streets.

00:03:12.646 --> 00:03:15.814
Under the ordinance,
if homelessness is identified in major areas,

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:17.721
police or private security officers

00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:20.307
are authorized to carry out immediate eviction.

00:03:20.307 --> 00:03:23.602
It referred to as the
"urban homeless removal system."

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:25.061
As a result, homeless people

00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:28.857
are being pushed into underground tunnels,
abandoned buildings, and storm drains.

00:03:28.857 --> 00:03:31.902
Human rights groups are pushing back,
calling it an effort to erase people,

00:03:31.902 --> 00:03:34.571
not provide welfare.

00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:36.781
Three members of a family were found dead

00:03:36.781 --> 00:03:39.993
in a semi-basement home in Hanyang City.

00:03:39.993 --> 00:03:42.662
Inside the room with
no electricity or running water,

00:03:42.662 --> 00:03:45.248
only a pizza box believed

00:03:45.248 --> 00:03:48.648
to be the family's last meal was found.

00:03:48.648 --> 00:03:51.474
Police say the parents,
driven by severe financial hardship,

00:03:51.474 --> 00:03:52.923
killed their young son

00:03:52.923 --> 00:03:56.109
before taking their own lives.

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.707
The room was piled with

00:03:57.707 --> 00:04:00.096
overdue bills and scrap paper,

00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:01.956
and the family's bank account was

00:04:01.956 --> 00:04:04.434
reportedly empty.

00:04:04.434 --> 00:04:07.228
The tragedy has sent
shockwaves through society,

00:04:07.228 --> 00:04:08.980
as economic hardship

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.091
pushed a family to the brink.

twenty-four employees who worked at

have been diagnosed with acute leukemia and brain tumors.

Also, nine have already died.

All of them were young,

Your Honor,

00:13:22.292 --> 00:13:24.142
Gojin Chemical's work sites are

00:13:24.142 --> 00:13:25.790
fully sealed to prevent

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:29.070

This is just a one-sided claim

Both sides are noted.

00:13:43.854 --> 00:13:45.718
Counsel for the defense,

00:13:45.718 --> 00:13:48.219
you filed a motion for an expert opinion

00:13:48.219 --> 00:13:50.916
on the link between
Gojin Chemical's work environment

00:13:50.916 --> 00:13:52.414

I happen to be the head of Haenal Law Firm.

I'm well aware your son-in-law
is a sitting judge.

00:14:19.318 --> 00:14:21.427
Cases he oversees

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:24.182
are often handled by Gwangmin,

This trial is...

00:14:27.495 --> 00:14:29.768
a matter of life and death
for Gojin Chemical.

00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:31.762
Former judges are useful,

00:14:31.762 --> 00:14:34.475
but a sitting judge is even better, right?

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.146
Gojin Chemical is...

00:14:46.083 --> 00:14:49.145
really lucky.

00:14:49.145 --> 00:14:50.371
Nine are already dead,

00:14:50.371 --> 00:14:53.991
and twenty-four have leukemia.

00:14:54.607 --> 00:14:57.407
We agreed on a partial win for the plaintiffs,

00:14:57.407 --> 00:15:00.201
so pay a reasonable amount and wrap it up.

00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:01.802
Okay.

00:15:03.373 --> 00:15:05.007
A partial win for the plaintiffs?

00:15:05.007 --> 00:15:06.032
Yes.

00:15:06.032 --> 00:15:10.599
As long as it looks like
the company made some effort,

00:15:10.599 --> 00:15:11.858
that should be fine.

00:15:11.858 --> 00:15:14.177
It'll hurt the company's image,

00:15:14.177 --> 00:15:15.912
and sales will drop.

00:15:15.912 --> 00:15:18.441
But if the plaintiffs' claims are
dismissed outright,

00:15:18.441 --> 00:15:22.013
the blame will fall on the court.

00:15:22.013 --> 00:15:25.706
The additional cost is
three hundred million in bearer bonds.

00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:28.426
Oh.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.999

Send it by courier.

00:15:36.434 --> 00:15:38.076
But still,

00:15:39.007 --> 00:15:41.450
is this really appropriate for a judge?

00:15:46.552 --> 00:15:49.838
That's exactly why I can do this.

00:32:07.665 --> 00:32:08.857
Then I'll believe you

00:32:08.857 --> 00:32:11.751
and stand by you no matter what.

"He's an upright judge, fair under heaven."

So if anyone dares badmouth my son,

00:32:18.882 --> 00:32:21.652
I won't let it slide.

Mom...

If my child did something wrong,

00:32:46.323 --> 00:32:49.480
then as his mother,
I should be the one to answer for it.

cleaned out S Group's coffers.

I'll take care of it.

It won't be free. Right?

00:33:51.976 --> 00:33:55.306
Isn't this costing more than it's worth?

00:33:55.306 --> 00:33:57.912
You said it was the group's coffers.

00:34:04.355 --> 00:34:06.761
Alright. I get it.

This is Kang Shin Jin.

Hello, Chief Justice.

You know S Group is in trouble.

What about Judge Lee Han Young?

00:34:22.213 --> 00:34:24.733
If you assign the case to him,

00:34:24.733 --> 00:34:26.889
he is perfect.

00:34:27.769 --> 00:34:29.837
We'll remove anything

00:34:29.837 --> 00:34:32.322

Who is Lee Han Young?

He's a judge.

00:34:39.742 --> 00:34:43.235
Haenal Law Firm brought him in
as a son-in-law lapdog.

00:34:44.129 --> 00:34:45.911
So...

00:34:45.911 --> 00:34:50.025
he rules however his masters tell him to?

Yes, understood.

He is Chairman Jang Tae Sik of S Group.

Nice to meet you.

00:36:49.472 --> 00:36:53.835
So your son is hiding somewhere,
and you are here instead?

00:36:53.835 --> 00:36:57.906
If you had any guts,
you'd drag that damn judge here.

Why did you come here alone?

Sorry for what?

bring your son who handed down

00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:13.289
that acquittal, that dismissal,

00:37:13.289 --> 00:37:17.092

there's the embezzlement of
S Construction's funds, correct?

No, that money is all mine.

All right.

00:45:00.645 --> 00:45:02.047
Come to think of it,

00:45:02.047 --> 00:45:04.725
Yoo Seon Cheol of Haenal Law Firm

00:45:04.725 --> 00:45:07.611
seems to care about you quite a lot.

00:45:16.624 --> 00:45:19.337
He's from a regional university,
and his training ranking was average.

00:45:19.337 --> 00:45:20.969
The year he started handling cases solo,

00:45:20.969 --> 00:45:23.089
he married into Haenal Law Firm.

00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:24.413
From then on,

00:45:24.413 --> 00:45:26.148
a front law firm Haenal set up,

00:45:26.148 --> 00:45:30.820
Gwangmin Law Firm,
has a one-hundred-percent win rate.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:34.418
They were all Judge Lee Han Young's cases.

00:45:34.418 --> 00:45:36.468
They didn't gain a son-in-law.

00:45:36.468 --> 00:45:38.188
They gained an ally.

00:45:38.188 --> 00:45:39.256
That's probably why

00:45:39.256 --> 00:45:40.782
he was the first in his class
to make presiding judge.

00:45:40.782 --> 00:45:41.975
What a bastard.

00:45:41.975 --> 00:45:44.693
But aside from the Gwangmin cases,

00:45:44.693 --> 00:45:46.762
his other rulings are considered
fairly balanced.

00:45:46.762 --> 00:45:48.664
So not a complete bastard?

00:45:48.664 --> 00:45:51.066
Lee Han Young's father has dementia.

00:45:51.066 --> 00:45:53.413
He's in a nursing facility in Gwacheon.

00:45:53.413 --> 00:45:55.541
Wow...

00:45:55.541 --> 00:45:58.181
Do you know how much a year there costs?

00:45:58.181 --> 00:46:00.162
Two hundred million won.

00:46:00.162 --> 00:46:02.189
The payments are from Yoo Se Hee.

00:46:02.189 --> 00:46:04.333
It's Lee Han Young's wife.

00:46:04.333 --> 00:46:08.486
Looks like he benefits plenty from his in-laws,

00:46:08.486 --> 00:46:10.868
but there's nothing in his own name.

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:12.887
He must be stashing it somewhere.

00:46:12.887 --> 00:46:15.075
Any women? Gambling? Anything else?

00:46:15.075 --> 00:46:18.040
He's a judge Haenal Law Firm has on a leash.

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.775
We need at least one weakness.

00:46:19.775 --> 00:46:21.812
He's got two nicknames.

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:24.637
One is "the in-laws' lapdog."

00:46:24.637 --> 00:46:25.794
Ever seen servants get paid

00:46:25.794 --> 00:46:29.212
when the masters make deals?

00:46:29.212 --> 00:46:32.997
No woman trouble. No gambling either.

00:46:32.997 --> 00:46:34.488
Among bastards,

00:46:34.488 --> 00:46:36.703
he's the obedient kind.

00:46:38.837 --> 00:46:40.259
Anything else?

00:46:40.259 --> 00:46:41.660
You said two nicknames.

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:42.991
Six-dot.

00:46:42.991 --> 00:46:44.142
"Six-dot?"

00:46:44.142 --> 00:46:45.855
Sounds like gambling.

00:46:45.855 --> 00:46:48.034
No, he doesn't gamble.

00:46:48.034 --> 00:46:51.468
It's because he clocks out at six, sharp.

00:46:59.893 --> 00:47:02.568
Is that even possible for a Korean judge?

00:47:02.568 --> 00:47:05.154
Yes. He's Haenal's son-in-law.

00:47:05.154 --> 00:47:06.865
That's why his caseload is...

00:47:06.865 --> 00:47:08.165
kept reasonable.

00:47:08.165 --> 00:47:10.662
Looks like you'll have to find
his weakness yourself, sir.

00:47:10.662 --> 00:47:12.762
Hang up.

00:47:54.394 --> 00:47:56.919

How the hell...

00:48:04.588 --> 00:48:06.465
did you botch the surveillance?

00:48:06.465 --> 00:48:07.494
What do we do?

00:48:07.494 --> 00:48:10.502
If this gets out,
they'll scream coercive investigation.

00:48:10.502 --> 00:48:12.696
Should we slap an embargo
on the legal reporters first?

00:48:12.696 --> 00:48:14.591
No.

00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:16.748
Leak it as a tip from a prosecution source,

00:48:16.748 --> 00:48:19.567
that homicide is a possibility.

00:48:19.567 --> 00:48:23.314

begging to save themselves.

00:49:09.263 --> 00:49:11.231
Han Young?

00:49:12.527 --> 00:49:14.561
My dear son.

00:49:14.561 --> 00:49:17.055
You have to be a judge.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.211
I became a judge a long time ago.

00:49:26.211 --> 00:49:29.158
Why are you still saying that?

00:49:29.158 --> 00:49:32.831
I don't even know
if I became a judge the way you wanted.

00:49:32.831 --> 00:49:35.966
Your son is so kind.

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:40.541
You're Judge Lee Han Young, right?

00:49:40.541 --> 00:49:41.926
I'm Prosecutor Kim Jin Ah...

00:49:41.926 --> 00:49:44.914
from the Special Division
of the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

00:49:49.334 --> 00:49:51.479
We'll be seeing each other in court soon.

00:49:51.479 --> 00:49:54.800
You know, Chairman Jang Tae Sik of S Group...

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.101
I'll be indicting him.

00:49:58.016 --> 00:50:00.581
I stirred up S Group's reservoir,

00:50:00.581 --> 00:50:03.392
and it looks like people up top panicked.

00:50:03.392 --> 00:50:06.169
They even pulled a judge from
the High Court's civil division

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:08.995
into the criminal division.

00:50:13.059 --> 00:50:15.557
Fine. You can play dumb.

00:50:15.557 --> 00:50:17.725
But this time, let's do it by the book.

00:50:17.725 --> 00:50:21.512
Otherwise, I'll start with you
and tear everything apart.

00:50:21.512 --> 00:50:24.061
I graduated second in my class
at Hankuk University Law School.

00:50:24.061 --> 00:50:27.864
I'm smart, and I've got a very nasty temper.

00:50:27.864 --> 00:50:30.814
From what I see, you don't look that smart.

00:50:33.893 --> 00:50:37.200
Then I guess you admit the nasty temper part.

00:50:39.654 --> 00:50:42.413
If you want to keep living
as your in-laws' lapdog,

00:50:42.413 --> 00:50:45.009
let's do it by the book this time.

00:50:45.009 --> 00:50:49.095
I'll request full transcripts
and audio recordings at trial.

00:50:49.095 --> 00:50:51.732
Don't. I'll deny it.

00:50:51.732 --> 00:50:53.220
Why?

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.449
Nervous?

00:50:56.325 --> 00:50:59.132
If you're nervous, you've already lost.

00:51:16.196 --> 00:51:17.364
Breaking news.

00:51:17.364 --> 00:51:20.622
Choi Jong Hak, CEO of S Construction,
who was under investigation,

00:51:20.622 --> 00:51:22.744
was found unconscious this morning

00:51:22.744 --> 00:51:24.869
while in custody at the Seoul Detention Center.

00:51:24.869 --> 00:51:27.624
He was rushed to the hospital

00:51:27.624 --> 00:51:29.766
but was later pronounced dead.

00:51:29.766 --> 00:51:32.077
Police are currently investigating the case,

00:51:32.077 --> 00:51:34.515
with suicide considered
the leading possibility.

00:51:34.515 --> 00:51:37.926
Given that Choi was a key figure
in the prosecution's investigation...

00:51:37.926 --> 00:51:39.344
CEO Choi Jong Hak...

00:51:39.344 --> 00:51:40.846
didn't kill himself.

00:51:40.846 --> 00:51:42.584
There is growing speculation about

00:51:42.584 --> 00:51:44.975
outside pressure or
possible third-party involvement.

00:51:44.975 --> 00:51:47.673
Prosecutors have seized
internal off-the-books ledgers,

00:51:47.673 --> 00:51:50.859
revealing illegal fund flows
worth trillions of won...

00:51:51.639 --> 00:51:53.428
Did you get anything out of him?

00:51:53.428 --> 00:51:54.660
No.

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.853
I just warned him.

00:51:56.853 --> 00:51:58.968
Didn't seem to work.

00:51:58.968 --> 00:52:01.408
You should've at least blown up at him.

00:52:01.408 --> 00:52:02.993
Yeah.

00:52:02.993 --> 00:52:05.413
I'm already regretting it.

00:52:41.396 --> 00:52:42.443
Sir,

00:52:42.443 --> 00:52:44.493
can we expect a fair trial today?

00:52:44.493 --> 00:52:46.391
Will the death of the S Construction CEO

00:52:46.391 --> 00:52:48.823
affect the ruling?

00:52:50.161 --> 00:52:51.438
Sir,

00:52:51.438 --> 00:52:54.131
just one comment please...

00:52:56.995 --> 00:52:58.088
Please step back.

00:52:58.088 --> 00:53:00.659
Please, sir.

00:53:00.659 --> 00:53:02.543
The prosecution is targeting

00:53:02.543 --> 00:53:04.117
Chairman Jang Tae Sik of S Group

00:53:04.117 --> 00:53:07.432
over embezzlement, slush funds,
and improper lobbying with banks.

00:53:07.432 --> 00:53:09.223
The court will rule fairly,

00:53:09.223 --> 00:53:10.644
based on the law and the facts.

00:53:10.644 --> 00:53:12.984
Please step back.

00:53:18.987 --> 00:53:20.946
Just one word, sir.

00:53:22.744 --> 00:53:24.984
Hello, Justice.

00:53:29.275 --> 00:53:31.253
You were appointed the same time as him?

00:53:31.253 --> 00:53:32.124
[Kim Yun Hyeok, Presiding Judge]

00:53:32.124 --> 00:53:34.009
Yes.
[Kim Yun Hyeok, Presiding Judge]

00:53:35.289 --> 00:53:37.402
Are you two close?

00:53:39.292 --> 00:53:42.355
We're on decent terms.

00:53:44.219 --> 00:53:46.285
Good.

00:53:48.913 --> 00:53:50.278
Aren't you curious...

00:53:50.278 --> 00:53:52.256
who killed the S Construction CEO?

00:53:52.256 --> 00:53:53.764
It was because of
prosecutorial coercion, right?

00:53:53.764 --> 00:53:56.229
Some say he was driven to suicide.

00:53:56.229 --> 00:53:58.875
Then you should be out catching the killer.

00:53:59.716 --> 00:54:01.284
What's the point?

00:54:01.284 --> 00:54:04.673
The court can just acquit him anyway.

00:54:04.673 --> 00:54:07.450
As long as you follow the law,

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:10.757
I'd beg on my knees if I had to.

00:54:10.757 --> 00:54:13.222
Oh, right.

00:54:13.222 --> 00:54:14.790
Not you.

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:18.023
I should do that to Yoo Seon Cheol
at Haenal Law Firm.

00:54:18.712 --> 00:54:21.392
Are you out of your mind?

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:28.794
These are the records of...

00:54:28.794 --> 00:54:31.614
Chairman Jang Tae Sik's
embezzlement and slush funds.

00:54:37.424 --> 00:54:39.910
[Kim Yong Jin,
Accounting Director of S Construction]

00:54:40.941 --> 00:54:43.635
They say you're obsessed with
indicting S Group.

00:54:43.635 --> 00:54:45.101
Is that a prosecutor's duty,

00:54:45.101 --> 00:54:48.054
or a personal grudge?

00:54:48.788 --> 00:54:50.734
Both.

00:54:52.619 --> 00:54:56.245
I went after Jang Tae Sik
the moment I became a prosecutor.

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:05.263
You have impure motives.

00:55:22.573 --> 00:55:24.767
Let's grab lunch.

00:55:24.767 --> 00:55:26.726
I'm busy.

00:55:29.242 --> 00:55:32.523
This is complicated to handle, isn't it?

00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:36.631
Not really.

00:55:41.514 --> 00:55:43.868
Anything I can help with?

00:55:45.538 --> 00:55:47.591
You'll miss lunch.

00:55:47.591 --> 00:55:48.741
What about the ruling?

00:55:48.741 --> 00:55:49.975
Yes.

00:55:49.975 --> 00:55:52.128
The S Group's trial date is
the day after tomorrow...

00:55:52.128 --> 00:55:53.460
So,

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:55.722
the draft ruling should be ready by now.

00:55:55.722 --> 00:55:58.879
I'll check it at his lunch.

00:55:58.879 --> 00:56:00.839
Okay.

00:56:06.536 --> 00:56:08.912
You still here?

00:56:11.207 --> 00:56:13.427
I'm heading out now.

00:56:27.377 --> 00:56:30.153
He is from a no-name school
with zero connections...

00:56:30.153 --> 00:56:33.446
Why did Haenal Law Firm
pick a guy like that?

00:56:33.446 --> 00:56:35.912
I'm way better than him.

00:56:38.348 --> 00:56:41.042
It looks like the ruling on
Chairman Jang isn't ready yet.

00:56:41.042 --> 00:56:43.662
I'm kind of nervous.

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:02.616
Finally...

00:57:02.616 --> 00:57:05.357
Are you heading to Haenal Law Firm?

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.113
Mr. Yoo,

00:57:21.113 --> 00:57:22.991
it's me.

00:57:22.991 --> 00:57:25.739
Judge Lee Han Young submitted his resignation.

00:57:25.739 --> 00:57:28.121
I thought you should know.

00:57:33.478 --> 00:57:34.504
Let's get dinner.

00:57:34.504 --> 00:57:36.201
Can't you eat without me?

00:57:36.201 --> 00:57:38.039
Not me.

00:57:38.039 --> 00:57:40.152
With the Justice.

00:58:02.895 --> 00:58:04.779
Thank you.

00:58:06.685 --> 00:58:09.156
There's a senior judicial research clerk
at the Supreme Court

00:58:09.156 --> 00:58:11.708
whose term is ending soon.

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:16.460
Once that seat opens,
it has to be filled immediately.

00:58:17.072 --> 00:58:18.390
That's unfortunate.

00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:21.783
If I'd known earlier, I wouldn't have resigned.

00:58:23.409 --> 00:58:25.475
You resigned?

00:58:26.963 --> 00:58:30.156
After work,
I stopped by the chief judge's office.

00:58:34.709 --> 00:58:37.515
Did Yoo Seon Cheol approve it?

00:58:40.976 --> 00:58:42.878
Do you really think...

00:58:42.878 --> 00:58:45.711
Yoo Seon Cheol approved?

00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:51.008
By now,

00:58:51.008 --> 00:58:52.319
he probably knows.

00:58:52.319 --> 00:58:55.718
Your resignation won't be accepted
for the time being.

00:58:57.277 --> 00:58:58.637
Chief Justice Kang Shin Jin

00:58:58.637 --> 00:59:01.522
is very interested in this case.

00:59:04.111 --> 00:59:07.792
The Supreme Court is bigger than
it looks from the outside.

00:59:07.792 --> 00:59:09.405
If you don't like the research post,

00:59:09.405 --> 00:59:11.918
decide what you do want.

00:59:13.862 --> 00:59:17.135
While you prepare for the S Group trial.

00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:30.946
The prosecution will reassign the case
after the first trial,

00:59:30.946 --> 00:59:34.762
and a different prosecutor will
handle the appeal.

00:59:34.762 --> 00:59:36.381
But...

00:59:36.381 --> 00:59:39.112
Judge Lee Han Young is the problem.

00:59:39.112 --> 00:59:41.837
He turned down a Supreme Court post...

00:59:41.837 --> 00:59:43.938
and resigned.

00:59:45.905 --> 00:59:48.790
Did he change that fast?

00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:53.640
This is getting messy.

01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:04.568
Hello, sir.

01:00:05.771 --> 01:00:10.168
Looks like your son-in-law lacks
respect for his father-in-law.

01:00:10.168 --> 01:00:13.383
[Haenal Law Firm]

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:23.217
Sit.

01:00:32.881 --> 01:00:35.623
Do you only use your mouth in court?

01:00:35.623 --> 01:00:39.670
No greeting at all?
Like, "Sir, how have you been?"

01:00:40.414 --> 01:00:41.750
Oh.

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:44.716
Is it because I'm younger than you?

01:00:49.582 --> 01:00:51.942
Hello, sir.

01:00:51.942 --> 01:00:53.356
See? Much nicer.

01:00:53.356 --> 01:00:55.954
A family greeting keeps
things nice and friendly.

01:00:55.954 --> 01:00:58.196
So, did you resign?

01:00:59.011 --> 01:01:01.045
Yes.

01:01:01.045 --> 01:01:03.343
Finish the S Group case,

01:01:03.343 --> 01:01:04.369
then come back.

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:07.282
No. I'm going independent.

01:01:09.308 --> 01:01:12.228
Father, did you hear that?

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.433
Did another firm make you an offer?

01:01:20.247 --> 01:01:21.982
That'd be interesting.

01:01:21.982 --> 01:01:24.906
Haenal's son-in-law working at another firm.

01:01:24.906 --> 01:01:26.826
No.

01:01:27.915 --> 01:01:30.086
Nothing like that.

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:33.960
We'll talk later.

01:01:37.083 --> 01:01:39.629
Presiding Judge Lee Han Young.

01:01:40.258 --> 01:01:42.871
This is for you.

01:01:47.074 --> 01:01:49.042
What is this?

01:01:51.153 --> 01:01:54.093
The final ruling in the S Group case.

01:01:58.853 --> 01:02:01.434
A judge's robe represents...

01:02:01.434 --> 01:02:03.711
authority entrusted...

01:02:03.711 --> 01:02:06.611
by the people.

01:02:08.526 --> 01:02:11.578
From now on,

01:02:12.894 --> 01:02:16.088
Haenal Law Firm's power

01:02:16.088 --> 01:02:18.480
will stand behind that authority.

01:02:28.076 --> 01:02:31.017
It's been ten years.

01:02:31.017 --> 01:02:34.020
Living like a dog...

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.697
on Haenal's leash.

01:02:37.605 --> 01:02:39.448
Now...

01:02:40.188 --> 01:02:43.593
you're forcing the ruling too?

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:46.159
Finish this case...

01:02:46.159 --> 01:02:47.178
and come back.

01:02:47.178 --> 01:02:48.388
I'll go independent.

01:02:48.388 --> 01:02:50.890
What changes if you're still
Haenal's son-in-law?

01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:53.484
Then I'll divorce.

01:02:54.745 --> 01:02:55.980
Father.

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.791
That's why you don't let
a lapdog taste money.

01:03:01.734 --> 01:03:03.658
Lapdog...

01:03:03.658 --> 01:03:05.626
Whatever you do,

01:03:06.279 --> 01:03:10.065
not until the S Group trial is over.

01:03:10.781 --> 01:03:12.977
Understand?

01:03:27.397 --> 01:03:30.199
My dealings with Haenal Law Firm

01:03:31.551 --> 01:03:33.849
end here.

01:04:03.015 --> 01:04:05.615
Should we have a kid?

01:04:05.615 --> 01:04:08.611
I'm not saying I'll carry one.

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.136
Just bring one from somewhere.

01:04:10.136 --> 01:04:12.104
Let's get divorced.

01:04:16.068 --> 01:04:18.444
You seeing someone?

01:04:25.467 --> 01:04:27.035
Just bring a kid.

01:04:27.035 --> 01:04:30.182
If you don't have one, start trying now.

01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:36.243
A daughter would be nice.

01:04:41.193 --> 01:04:43.916
I told your father.

01:04:57.032 --> 01:04:59.585
You can't divorce me.

01:04:59.585 --> 01:05:01.725
Divorce happens...

01:05:03.936 --> 01:05:07.409
when I decide it does.

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:11.789
Don't come home

01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:13.222
until I say...

01:05:13.222 --> 01:05:15.622
you can.

01:05:43.099 --> 01:05:44.396
Father.

01:05:44.396 --> 01:05:47.858
That's why you don't let a lapdog taste money.

01:05:48.944 --> 01:05:51.604
I lived like a loser.

01:05:57.274 --> 01:06:01.167
You bastard, just drop dead!

01:06:03.897 --> 01:06:06.031
What?

01:06:06.031 --> 01:06:07.061
Hey.

01:06:07.061 --> 01:06:09.367
What did you just say?

01:06:09.367 --> 01:06:10.715
What did you just say?

01:06:10.715 --> 01:06:12.093
- Don't.
- Let go!

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:14.759
Drop dead, you bastard!

01:06:17.883 --> 01:06:20.243
You're nothing.

01:06:21.659 --> 01:06:22.717
Hey!

01:06:22.717 --> 01:06:24.170
Hey, stop it.

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:25.488
Stop.

01:06:25.488 --> 01:06:27.667
Hey, stop it.

01:06:27.667 --> 01:06:30.306
Enough. Come here.

01:06:30.902 --> 01:06:32.782
Let's just go.

01:07:24.445 --> 01:07:26.163
The granddaughter downstairs
took her own life.

01:07:26.163 --> 01:07:28.089
The plaintiffs' claims are...

01:07:28.089 --> 01:07:30.255
Some damn judge...

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:32.839
- Dismissed.
- pushed a dying person over the edge.

01:07:32.839 --> 01:07:34.590
Not guilty?

01:07:34.590 --> 01:07:35.842
How is he innocent?

01:07:35.842 --> 01:07:38.052
That's why you don't let a lapdog taste money.

01:07:38.052 --> 01:07:41.421
What kind of heartless law is this?

01:07:41.421 --> 01:07:44.074
How are we supposed to live
with this injustice?

01:07:44.074 --> 01:07:47.033
I can't live with this.

01:08:03.865 --> 01:08:06.667
How did my son end up like this?

01:08:44.782 --> 01:08:47.328
It's time. Why isn't he here yet?

01:08:47.328 --> 01:08:50.440
He'll be in any moment.

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.759
If the people taking my money worked like this,

01:08:52.759 --> 01:08:54.703
they'd all be finished.

01:08:54.703 --> 01:08:57.270
Of course. I know.

01:09:00.527 --> 01:09:03.412
All rise.

01:09:16.836 --> 01:09:19.346
Please be seated.

01:09:29.723 --> 01:09:31.458
The defendant, Jang Tae Sik,

01:09:31.458 --> 01:09:33.295
is merely a victim of

01:09:33.295 --> 01:09:36.388
the reckless and immoral embezzlement
and slush fund schemes

01:09:36.388 --> 01:09:39.289
carried out by S Construction
CEO Choi Jong Hak.

01:09:39.289 --> 01:09:41.395
However,

01:09:41.395 --> 01:09:43.463
an employee's wrongdoing is...

01:09:43.463 --> 01:09:47.741
ultimately the chairman's responsibility.

01:09:47.741 --> 01:09:50.188
I repent.

01:09:59.648 --> 01:10:01.258
For the past ten years,

01:10:01.258 --> 01:10:03.744
the defendant used S Construction

01:10:03.744 --> 01:10:05.312
as a vehicle for embezzlement

01:10:05.312 --> 01:10:08.556
and slush funds.

01:10:08.556 --> 01:10:11.422
Also, now seeks to pin his crimes...

01:10:11.422 --> 01:10:14.056
on the late CEO Choi Jong Hak.

01:10:16.902 --> 01:10:18.878
Accordingly, the prosecution,

01:10:18.878 --> 01:10:22.656
under the Act on Aggravated Punishment
of Specific Economic Crimes,

01:10:22.656 --> 01:10:25.257
seeks a sentence of...

01:10:25.257 --> 01:10:27.364
six years in prison

01:10:27.364 --> 01:10:29.508
and a fine of 12 billion won

01:10:29.508 --> 01:10:31.923
for the defendant, Jang Tae Sik.

01:10:33.811 --> 01:10:35.987
Don't worry.

01:10:52.145 --> 01:10:54.912
Defendant, please stand.

01:11:21.208 --> 01:11:23.195
The court orders.

01:11:24.964 --> 01:11:27.431
The defendant, Jang Tae Sik,

01:11:33.826 --> 01:11:36.729
is sentenced to ten years in prison

01:11:36.729 --> 01:11:39.101
and a fine of 24 billion won.

01:11:39.101 --> 01:11:42.134
The defendant is taken into custody.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:47.501
What? What just happened?

01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:56.479
Did you hear that? Ten years.

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:58.892
Why such a nice ruling?

01:11:58.892 --> 01:12:02.089
Is there anyone to notify
of the defendant's detention?

01:12:02.089 --> 01:12:03.901
Has he lost his mind?

01:12:03.901 --> 01:12:05.674
Hey, come down here!

01:12:05.674 --> 01:12:07.154
- What? Detention?
- Please calm down.

01:12:07.154 --> 01:12:08.347
Ten years?

01:12:08.347 --> 01:12:10.449
Let go of me! Are you kidding me?

01:12:10.449 --> 01:12:11.900
Judge Lee!

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:13.525
Redo this!

01:12:13.525 --> 01:12:15.431
Hey!

01:13:01.579 --> 01:13:04.189
Do you know what you just did?

01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:05.336
Tell them to appeal.

01:13:05.336 --> 01:13:07.482
What? This punk.

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:18.793
What the hell are you doing?

01:13:22.322 --> 01:13:25.181
Ridiculous.

01:13:25.181 --> 01:13:28.049
Did you want a divorce that badly?

01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:32.742
I'll send the papers.

01:13:55.291 --> 01:13:57.945
[Defendant's Seat]

01:14:03.155 --> 01:14:05.433
The defendant, Lee Han Young,

01:14:05.433 --> 01:14:08.499
is charged with murdering an accomplice

01:14:08.499 --> 01:14:10.567
and issuing threats.

01:14:10.567 --> 01:14:13.112
The prosecution hereby brings charges

01:14:13.112 --> 01:14:15.948
against the defendant, Lee Han Young.

01:14:15.948 --> 01:14:17.182
Defendant,

01:14:17.182 --> 01:14:19.881
do you admit to the charges?

01:14:32.246 --> 01:14:33.689
No. No.

01:14:33.689 --> 01:14:36.032
No!

01:14:36.032 --> 01:14:38.237
Defendant.

01:14:38.237 --> 01:14:40.338
It wasn't me!

01:14:45.434 --> 01:14:47.875
No.

01:14:47.875 --> 01:14:49.599
I...

01:14:49.599 --> 01:14:52.526
I am not guilty.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.813
I'm not guilty!

01:14:56.486 --> 01:14:59.398
I'm not guilty.

01:15:30.282 --> 01:15:32.292
I'll prove my own innocence.

01:15:32.292 --> 01:15:34.162
You can't handle this alone.

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:35.234
You piece of trash!

01:15:35.234 --> 01:15:37.833
This is what happens when trash plays judge!

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:39.219
I finally want to live...

01:15:39.219 --> 01:15:42.250
as the real Lee Han Young.

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:43.494
2025?

01:15:43.494 --> 01:15:45.863
I'm back exactly ten years.

01:15:45.863 --> 01:15:47.278
Kim Sang Jin?

01:15:47.278 --> 01:15:49.161
Arrest him now.
If you don't, that child will die.

01:15:49.161 --> 01:15:51.185
- How do you know that?
- Didn't you read the case file?

01:15:51.185 --> 01:15:52.542
You released him.

01:15:52.542 --> 01:15:53.862
I have a child.

01:15:53.862 --> 01:15:55.015
Right. I'm a judge.

01:15:55.015 --> 01:15:56.952
Then try Kim Sang Jin with me.

01:15:56.952 --> 01:16:00.305
I have to prove he's a serial killer.
