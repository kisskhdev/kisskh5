00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.990
[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.000
[Episode 8]

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.280
When that day comes,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.120
I hope you all remember
what was said on this boat today—

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.320
your heartfelt words

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.400
and lofty ambitions.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.350
Stand tall

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.390
and be the backbone of Great Xia.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.509
It was clearly just rhetoric

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:56.840
to recruit scholars.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.039
But why, after hearing it,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.230
do I feel like crying?

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.210
Your Majesty...

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.040
places such high hopes on us.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.330
I...

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.090
I really...

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.590
How inappropriate!

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.590
How can an emperor

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.020
speak so casually?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.960
Just because of the hardships,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.430
you want to turn poor scholars' bodies

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.490
into pawns

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.430
and sacrifice their lives for you,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.150
depose the Empress Dowager,
and get rid of Prince Duan.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.560
Because you are surviving precariously,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.420
you cannot express your own will.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.800
You have obstacles everywhere you head,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.840
so you cannot rectify court discipline.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.100
As the mighty Emperor,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.150
if you don't even have such courage,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.240
how can you talk about
paying fortunes for talent,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.170
pushing others to be the backbone?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.079
The common people in my village—

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.120
every household—

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.590
all toil in the fields all day,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.360
saving every grain they can,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.020
yet have barely enough to eat.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.090
My younger brother and sister,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.810
starved to death during a year

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.280
of poor harvest
shortly after they were born.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.030
Such heavy taxes—

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.960
did they truly go where they should?

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.680
The Central Army has been fighting
against Yan State for years.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.240
Yet the soldier provisions

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.170
are mixed with 30% sand and stones.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.280
As soon as I arrived in the capital,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.010
I saw the Court of Revision beat to death
a woman crying for justice.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.240
Your Majesty...

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.480
Your Majesty!

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.360
Have you truly opened your eyes

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.420
to see what I've described?

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.710
Li,

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.150
no need to say all this.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.480
Who was it that just said

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.400
if they could meet the Emperor,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.310
they would kowtow and offer advice
even at the cost of their lives?

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.310
Now the Emperor is right before you.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.290
What's happened to all of you?

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.079
Gone mute?

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.750
His Majesty
did punish the Minister of Revenue.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.010
It caused quite a stir.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.490
I believe everyone has heard about it.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.190
As for the case of the runaway horse,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.190
His Majesty also found a way

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.190
to bring
Grand Tutor Wei's family to justice.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.590
But

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.680
rumors among the people say

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.080
it was Prince Duan's doing.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.810
Every household in my hometown

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.590
were burning incense
praying for his blessing.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.810
No matter who did it,

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.690
have the people's lives

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.560
improved?

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.490
The incense from every household

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.430
was burned in vain at the end of the day.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.800
Li.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.270
Li.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.050
Defying the Emperor

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.120
is a capital offense.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.980
I don't mind
spilling my blood on this pleasure boat

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.120
to prove my determination with death.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.070
This perfectly fulfills my wish.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.170
-Mr. Li.
-Wait!

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.330
Mr...

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.360
Mr. Li.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.720
His Majesty came here today

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.080
not to drag everyone into court factions.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.400
Besides,

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.070
those who hold positions without merit,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.800
also those of the royal family,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.380
their deaths mean little.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.159
But what crime
have the common people committed?

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:58.890
The situation has become dire.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.360
Unfair taxation,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.850
corrupt officials,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.730
rampant corruption, and empty treasury...

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.600
Our abilities are limited.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.510
Though we have solutions,

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.390
one hand can't clap.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.950
That's why we need your help.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.250
I'm not eloquent

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.000
and cannot speak of grand principles.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.070
But besides being a consort,

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.560
I am also a citizen of Great Xia.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.430
I love this land.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.070
I also want to do something

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.600
for the people living here.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.200
But I am stupid.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.060
I can only implore you all.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.530
This is not for any tyrant
or demonic consort,

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.990
but for...

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.890
our elders of our homeland,

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.470
and for our deceased brothers and sisters.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.360
Please consider it carefully.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.400
If you wish to leave,

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.600
I will not stop you.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.540
If you wish to serve as officials,

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.030
I will fully support you,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.430
even if not under my command.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.760
I don't understand.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.090
Why are you doing this?

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.330
There is no particular reason.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.920
It's only because I believe

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.230
that wherever you are,

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.440
whatever you do,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.440
you surely act for the good of Great Xia.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.990
Even if...

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.760
it means opposing me.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.920
I...

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.870
I...

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.070
I never understood before why,

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.130
when speaking to the royals,
we condescend ourselves.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.560
Are we born to be trampled upon?

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.430
Now I understand.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.750
We are just

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.990
ever-growing and resilient—
the foundation.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.270
I was born with a terrible illness

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.890
and have only
two or three years left to live.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.890
May I ask Your Majesty,

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.870
will I live to see peace and prosperity,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.040
harmony and abundance?

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.710
This is my promise as the Emperor.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.450
I, Cen Jintian,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.680
am willing to serve Your Majesty

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.810
with all my loyalty.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.800
Even if they are just 2D characters,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.360
the suffering they endure

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.920
is real pain to them.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.530
I've always overlooked this fact,

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.000
thinking I was different from them.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.270
But how can I be certain

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.220
that I'm not a 2D character myself?

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.320
Since we're here,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.700
we might as well accept it.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.960
Hey, quick!

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.720
There's a leak!

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.250
Boatman!

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.560
Your boat is leaking!

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.280
Plug it!

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.480
-Mr. Yang, our boat is leaking!
-Help!

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.500
S-Same here!

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:23.960
Save them quickly!

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.120
Make sure to rescue all the scholars!

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:25.780
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:09:59.240 --> 00:09:59.660
Quick!

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.590
Grab it!

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.670
Xu Yao!

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.240
Get up!

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.000
This isn't how your story ends
in the book.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.240
You still have a vendetta to settle.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.500
You're still so young.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.870
You must have many things you want to do.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.440
In your story, your ending

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.670
is to be second only to one,
above thousands,

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:00.170

Do you remember?

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.670
That day at Banyue House,

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:55.870
Du Shan said

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.890
it was his final attempt
at the imperial exam.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:04.720
His poem

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.440
had just begun
to spread throughout the capital.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.040
It had just given him hope...

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.240
only for him to end up like this.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.610
Try to see it differently.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.650
Sacrificing one person

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.800
to ensure others' survival

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.280
is sometimes unavoidable.

Xiahou Po...

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.370
No matter if he foresaw this

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:41.960
or tracked us here,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.060
how dare he kill as soon as he got here—

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.970
right in front of me too.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:51.600
He simply wants to intimidate

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.060
me, an emperor
who suddenly wants to resist.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:55.610
I was wondering

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.240
what tragic past he had in his backstory

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.440
that made him feel compelled
by government corruption

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.720
to seize the throne.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.640
But the people he just tried to kill...

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.250
are the future officials,

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.490
the backbone of our nation,

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:16.680
and the final hope
to stabilize Great Xia.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:18.089
If he is a 2D character,

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.349
then he's killing innocent people.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.450
If he comes from a higher level,

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.060
knowing exactly who they are,

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:27.910
yet still choosing to kill them,

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.980
then it's for his own future as a warlord,

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.920

would I have died there too?

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.510

Certain of what?

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.610
Prince Duan must be a 2D character.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.300
Why do you say that?

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:12.440
West Mountain and East Lake are far apart.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.440
Prince Duan has limited forces.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.100
If he had a god's perspective,

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.000
knowing we were at East Lake,

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.960
why did they send
most of their forces to West Mountain

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.290
to surround our decoys?

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.940
He wasn't completely confident either.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.150
That's right.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.680
And the people
who ambushed us at East Lake

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.300
were few in number.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.650
They were clearly unprepared.

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:38.410
Otherwise,

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.880
it wouldn't have ended with
just one scholar's death.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.880
Exactly.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.640
And at East Lake,

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.030
they clearly didn't anticipate

Mr. Bei's fighting ability.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.000
Just as you said,

they killed someone in front of us

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.790
to intimidate us.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.440
There's no reason they could have lost.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.960
I don't believe it if their loss

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.700
was a calculated move too.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:08.750
So

Who else is there?

That shout of yours was impressive,

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.160
but it might have exposed you to him.

Actually, even without my shout,

Prince Duan would have suspected me
sooner or later.

The scholars, before meeting us,

had no idea who we were.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.600
Sacrificing one person

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.730
to ensure others' survival

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.690
is sometimes unavoidable.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.820
Sacrificing one 2D character

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.010
-for greater benefits.
-Drag him out!

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.000
After all,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.240
-he doesn't think their lives...
-Drag him out!

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.070
-I'm telling the truth.
-Are that important.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.870
Your Majesty!

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.640
They're all 2D characters—

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.770
all promising talents in their prime.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.330
In the blink of an eye...

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.050
Am I overthinking this?

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.620
If he can't be trusted either,

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.160
then in this palace,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.960
who can I trust?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:13.750
What are you thinking about?

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:14.280
Nothing.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.030
I'll investigate

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.080
this slowly.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.370
You're injured.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.700
You need to rest properly.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:26.550
You may leave now.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.080
You forgot? You've fallen out of favor.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.150
Xie Yong'er is coming soon.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:32.680
Go ahead.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:36.360
Yes, yes.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.250
Then I'll take my leave.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:40.240
Wait.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.410
How are you going to explain

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.010
the wound on your hand?

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:52.290
Get out!

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.610
Your Majesty, please spare me!

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.720
Which cross-eyed imperial physician

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.750
bandaged this

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.680
in such a ghastly manner?

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.240
It's not that bad.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.320
How can His Majesty do this?

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.830
He only cares for the newcomers
and ignores those that have been around.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.270
Even if Master made a mistake,

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.600
he shouldn't take it out on Your Highness.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.400
I just got a small cut

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.400
from a broken cup.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.780
How can this be blamed on His Majesty?

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.550
But I clearly saw it.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.440
Madam,

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.310
I suddenly want some sweet porridge.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:32.640
Could you make me a bowl?

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.240
Madam Bei is His Majesty's person.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.240
Watch what you say

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.720
and don't upset her.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.790
I'm not afraid.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.080
I'm just worried about My Lady.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.110
You could have been with your beloved,

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.680
living a happy life.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.240
But now you're trapped in this palace,

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.720
dealing with that tyrant every day.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.140
He even has people
watching you constantly.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.590
Serving the emperor is like
being with a tiger.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.520
Watch your head.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.160
How does Mei still remember

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.550
my original character
of secretly loving Prince Duan?

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.240
After being with me for so long,

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.840
why hasn't she caught on yet?

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:22.790
Du,

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:25.440
you always

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.030
found me

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.550
stingy.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.500
Today I bought the finest
and most expensive Huadiao wine.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.920
Wherever you are,

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:37.250
drink more.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:46.310
In Du's lifetime,

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.620
his ambitions were unfulfilled,

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.480
he had no way to serve his country,

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.950
and poured all his passion into poetry.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:53.790
Now,

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:55.880
having met a wise ruler,

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.070
-we will take on Du's sincerity...
-What's wrong?

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.130
and spare no effort to help Great Xia.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:02.830
Du,

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.310
just watch us.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:09.550
After what happened,

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.600
you must all understand

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:14.960
that to work with me, a puppet emperor,

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.540
to do something real for Great Xia

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.210
requires taking great risks.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:22.080
If you wish to withdraw,

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:23.810
it's understandable.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.510
However,

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:28.680
you have already been involved
in confidential matters.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.340
Forgive me,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.020
but I cannot let you

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.570
return home on your own.

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.530
I hope you understand.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.890
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.440
Do you want to kill us?

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.000
No.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.440
I will find you a place

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.750
far from this quagmire.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.110
I won't force you

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.110
to offer counsel

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.000
or act as advisors.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.620
You just need to study in peace

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:03.970
until the situation
in the capital stabilizes.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.250
No matter

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:06.810
who sits on the throne,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:07.830
you

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.770
will still be yourselves—

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.070
honest and capable talents.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.590
When that time comes,

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.250
use your knowledge and skills

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.170
to become virtuous ministers

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.250
remembered for generations.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.350
I,

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:38.860
Yang Duojie...

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:39.640
I,

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:40.720
Wang Zhao...

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.070
I,

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:42.250
Li Yunxi...

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.070
I,

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.960
Er Lan,

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.030
am willing to serve
Your Majesty with utmost loyalty

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:48.160
only for Great Xia's

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:49.270
peace.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.160
I don't have much time left

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.490
and cannot wait any longer.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:57.480
I only wish to witness Great Xia

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.840
return from darkness to light.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:03.880
We pledge to serve
with all our might until our last breath.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:10.640
Du.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.230
The six of us once promised

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.910
to be loyal to our country

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.760
and serve in the court together.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:17.310
Now,

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:19.790
you have departed

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:21.720
while we stayed.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.000
We will do our utmost

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:25.990
to support our wise ruler

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.170
in hopes of bringing peace to the land

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:30.480
and comfort your spirit in heaven.

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:31.630
Rest assured,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.490
this day will come soon.

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:36.980
The corrupt officials will pay the price.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.010
We will soon

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:40.750
restore your reputation.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:59.230
[Tomb of Nameless]

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:04.720
The weather is lovely today.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.070
Having you accompany me

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.680
brings me great joy.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.720
Your Majesty, look.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.920
I designed these flower arrangements
for the Flower Festival Banquet.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.830
They're all the most precious varieties

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.890
symbolizing prosperity and wealth.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:20.440
These flowers are indeed precious.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:23.870
But when arranged together,

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:26.510
they look somewhat disorganized.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:29.350
Then Your Highness, please look at mine.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:30.960
These are all jasmine flowers

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.680
with an enchanting fragrance.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.740
Please smell them.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.570
Jasmine indeed has a pure fragrance.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:42.790
But they look somewhat plain

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.640
and rather shabby.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.160
Then, Your Highness,

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:48.750
please look at these.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.110
Do you like orchids?

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:54.010
Orchids from secluded valleys
have extraordinary elegance.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.240
Orchids are indeed refined.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.750
But we must consider the symbolism.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.400
After all,
they will be displayed in the palace.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.060
They should convey
grandeur and magnificence.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:07.440
Yes.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.240
A talented scholar's life

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.510
is worth no more
than a handful of wildflowers.

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.040
Yet to please the powerful,

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:16.110
we exhaust ourselves thinking,

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.270
wasting resources
and burdening the people.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:18.000
Consort Xie,

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:19.880
what have you prepared?

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:23.400
Your Majesty,

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.290
I prepared peonies.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:31.030
Peonies?

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.310
Isn't that too common?

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:35.510
Right?

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.000
You are right.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.490
Though this flower is common,

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.390
the Flower Festival Banquet

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.190
happens only once a year.

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.570
This is about
Her Majesty's reputation.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.640
Her Majesty said

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.110
we must not only consider
whether it is precious or not,

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:53.970
but also their symbolic meaning.

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:56.480
They cannot appear too shabby either.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.000
Beautiful peony,

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:05.790
amidst a cluster of a hundred flowers

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.920
your stunning radiance blooms alone.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.750
Peony,

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.550
with the essence of all fragrances combined,

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.110
fully displaying the grandeur of a prosperous age.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.440
Though they speak of your delicacy, laden with dew,

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.400
your gentleness

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.040
is like the spring breeze bringing warmth.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:28.110
Though they praise your nobility and overflowing scent—

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.030
do they know?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.930
You have also endured the deepest cold and hardship.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.110
When the freezing snow sealed the earth,

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.640
you were quietly nurturing a thousand hopes.

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.550
And when the East Wind brushes the face,

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.320
you take your prosperity

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.550
and scatter it across the world.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.410
She recited
that long paragraph just like that?

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.110
This flattery is way too obvious.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.850
Beautiful poem!

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.880
Using flowers to symbolize people,

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.080
subtle yet profound.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.840
Consort Xie,

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.920
you truly embody scholarly elegance.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.960
No wonder the Emperor favors you so much.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.850
Thank you for your praise, Your Majesty.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.150
Unlike some people

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.110
who lack proper manners.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.000
Why must everything involve me?

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.239
What Flower Festival Banquet?

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.280
I think they're just bored
and want to waste money.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.480
Common people can barely afford to eat,

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:43.710
yet they still have time
for such frivolities.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.800
This isn't the way back to the palace.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.110
I didn't dare call out to you
since you were walking this way

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.239
with your head down.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:52.920
No wonder.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:54.270
-Let's—
-Consort Yu.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:58.970
The palace is so large,

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.590
yet somehow I run into him everywhere.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:02.440
Such bad luck.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:03.820
Your Highness.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.580
Consort Yu.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.550
May I have a word with you?
