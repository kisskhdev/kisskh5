{\an8}‪ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
‪ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:35.825
Hurry.

00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:38.065
Bring him back, now!

00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:39.745
- Understood.
- Bring him back?

00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:43.705
Lu Zhenglian was sent back
to his hometown before dawn today.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:45.465
Who authorized this?

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:47.305
The order came from the palace.

00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:53.785
I'll go after Lu Zhenglian.

00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:55.465
Go to the Palace Investigation Bureau.
Find Inspector Du.

00:02:09.144 --> 00:02:10.225
What is the rush?

00:02:10.304 --> 00:02:13.145
Li Peiyi found out
that the escaped palace maid

00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:15.185
was killed by Lu Zhenglian.

00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:18.665
Lu Zhenglian was demoted

00:02:18.745 --> 00:02:21.385
and sent back
to his hometown this morning.

00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:22.625
She will go after him or something?

00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:25.545
Well…

00:02:27.225 --> 00:02:29.185
- She did go after him?
- That's right.

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:33.745
Given her temperament,
things will be tricky.

00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:36.265
If Lu Zhenglian ends up
testifying against us,

00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:38.785
then don't give him the chance to speak.

00:02:38.865 --> 00:02:41.585
It might be too late to take action.

00:02:41.665 --> 00:02:43.585
We might be implicated. If we get exposed…

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:44.545
Your turn.

00:02:45.225 --> 00:02:46.785
You're still in the mood for Go?

00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:49.545
So impatient.

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:51.785
Then I will win.

00:02:54.345 --> 00:02:55.665
Relax.

00:02:56.745 --> 00:02:59.745
This game seems
to have reached a dead end,

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:02.705
but there is still
a chance for a turnaround.

00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:07.585
It seems there is no way out
at the center point.

00:03:09.025 --> 00:03:10.225
How to break the deadlock?

00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:19.665
Marvelous.

00:03:20.905 --> 00:03:23.345
All paths have led to an impasse.

00:03:23.985 --> 00:03:25.985
But there is always a way out.

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:29.105
If a head-on clash cannot bring victory,

00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:30.545
then besiege Wei to rescue Zhao.

00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:33.865
See, we found a way to break the deadlock.

00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:35.745
Your Highness.

00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:37.505
{\an8}CHUNMING GATE

00:04:30.345 --> 00:04:32.265
CHUNMING GATE

00:04:57.665 --> 00:04:58.585
Mr. Lu.

00:05:00.025 --> 00:05:02.665
- What happened?
- Something darted past

00:05:02.745 --> 00:05:04.105
and spooked the horse.

00:05:06.585 --> 00:05:07.865
What do we do now?

00:05:08.905 --> 00:05:10.505
Both the carriage
and the horse are done for.

00:05:10.585 --> 00:05:12.185
I'm afraid we can't travel further today.

00:05:14.185 --> 00:05:15.985
I can never count on you.

00:05:44.105 --> 00:05:45.145
Mr. Lu.

00:05:45.665 --> 00:05:47.105
Don't leave me here.

00:05:47.185 --> 00:05:48.665
Both jailers are dead.

00:05:48.745 --> 00:05:50.785
Y-You're escaping from custody.

00:05:51.745 --> 00:05:54.385
You expect me to wait here
and die with you?

00:05:54.465 --> 00:05:55.865
His Highness planned this for me.

00:05:55.945 --> 00:05:58.265
How can I let you loser hold me back?

00:06:04.825 --> 00:06:06.145
Mr. Lu.

00:06:07.505 --> 00:06:08.665
Mr. Lu.

00:06:08.745 --> 00:06:09.985
Mr. Lu, are you alright?

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:21.025
Li Peiyi.

00:06:21.105 --> 00:06:22.345
How dare you attack
a fourth-rank official!

00:06:24.545 --> 00:06:26.625
Still daydreaming?

00:06:28.105 --> 00:06:28.945
Recognize this?

00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:32.065
I've confessed
that I went to the Xiuhong House.

00:06:32.145 --> 00:06:34.505
You disguised yourself
as one of the girls there to tease me.

00:06:34.585 --> 00:06:35.985
That was an accident.

00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:39.305
I'll ask you one more time.
Do you remember Hanxiao?

00:06:40.585 --> 00:06:42.545
Who is this Hanxiao?

00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:44.625
I don't know her. I've never heard of her.

00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:46.105
Half a month ago,

00:06:46.185 --> 00:06:48.105
the Flower on the Wall case
shook the inner palace.

00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:49.705
A woman was buried within the palace wall,

00:06:49.785 --> 00:06:51.385
her body covered in scars.

00:06:51.465 --> 00:06:53.105
She died from long-term abuse

00:06:53.185 --> 00:06:55.425
and had been imprisoned
in the Xiuhong House.

00:06:55.505 --> 00:06:56.905
She had a red mole on each ankle.

00:06:57.505 --> 00:06:58.465
Her name was Hanxiao.

00:06:58.545 --> 00:06:59.585
She…

00:07:00.145 --> 00:07:00.985
She's dead?

00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:08.105
You took a person's life,
yet you don't even remember her name.

00:07:08.905 --> 00:07:10.425
I didn't kill her.

00:07:11.025 --> 00:07:13.305
The Xiuhong House has so many patrons.

00:07:13.385 --> 00:07:14.585
Why do you pin it on me?

00:07:14.665 --> 00:07:17.185
Because the scars on Hanxiao's body

00:07:17.265 --> 00:07:18.745
are the same as the one on my arm.

00:07:21.305 --> 00:07:22.945
This time, no one can save you.

00:07:43.185 --> 00:07:44.305
You wouldn't dare.

00:07:45.105 --> 00:07:47.665
You've schemed so much with such care

00:07:48.265 --> 00:07:49.905
because you want to live so badly.

00:07:50.705 --> 00:07:52.105
You don't just want to live,

00:07:52.185 --> 00:07:54.945
you want to live gloriously
and comfortably.

00:07:55.545 --> 00:07:58.585
You cherish your own life
while treating others' lives as worthless.

00:08:00.425 --> 00:08:02.425
I don't mind
sending you to the afterworld.

00:08:02.505 --> 00:08:04.305
No, no. No, no.

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:05.945
I know everything about the Xiuhong House.

00:08:06.025 --> 00:08:07.945
Spare my life. I'll tell you everything.

00:08:08.025 --> 00:08:08.945
Everything.

00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:18.305
Murder!

00:08:34.545 --> 00:08:37.105
Your Ladyship. You…

00:08:40.545 --> 00:08:41.625
How dare you!

00:08:45.905 --> 00:08:46.945
Wu Yuekun.

00:08:48.705 --> 00:08:49.785
What do you want?

00:08:50.425 --> 00:08:51.505
Inspector Du.

00:08:52.025 --> 00:08:54.465
Is it about what I want?

00:08:54.545 --> 00:08:56.225
Her Ladyship killed someone.

00:08:56.305 --> 00:08:57.985
Many people saw it.

00:08:58.065 --> 00:08:59.905
What can we do?

00:09:08.585 --> 00:09:09.425
What happened?

00:09:10.025 --> 00:09:11.945
I rushed here
only to find the overturned carriage

00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:13.985
and Lu Zhenglian ready to escape.

00:09:14.585 --> 00:09:16.585
He wanted to confess to save his life.

00:09:16.665 --> 00:09:19.185
So the driver pushed him onto my sword

00:09:19.265 --> 00:09:21.385
and then slit his own throat.

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:25.225
How credible does it sound to you?

00:10:10.825 --> 00:10:12.825
No, no. Don't kill me.

00:10:12.905 --> 00:10:14.345
I know everything about the Xiuhong House.

00:10:14.425 --> 00:10:15.865
Spare my life. I'll tell you everything.

00:10:15.945 --> 00:10:16.945
Everything.

00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:19.745
Murder!

00:10:31.025 --> 00:10:33.705
With an eyewitness, I'd say 80%.

00:10:35.185 --> 00:10:36.105
But there is none.

00:10:37.065 --> 00:10:37.905
Then it's only 10%.

00:10:53.545 --> 00:10:55.425
- Take me to the Court of Judicial Review.
- But…

00:10:55.505 --> 00:10:56.425
No.

00:10:56.505 --> 00:10:58.345
The Inner Guards found out about it.

00:10:58.425 --> 00:10:59.865
You should go
to the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:10:59.945 --> 00:11:01.145
Enough.

00:11:01.225 --> 00:11:03.025
This is a serious case.

00:11:03.105 --> 00:11:04.425
Report it to His Majesty.

00:11:07.225 --> 00:11:08.185
Inspector Du.

00:11:08.265 --> 00:11:12.425
Take the suspect,
Li Peiyi, to see His Majesty.

00:11:17.185 --> 00:11:20.025
Please calm your anger
for your health, Your Majesty.

00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:21.345
Wasn't the case closed?

00:11:21.425 --> 00:11:22.705
Why did she go after Lu Zhenglian?

00:11:23.865 --> 00:11:27.425
It's said that she had found
other evidence

00:11:27.505 --> 00:11:31.905
connecting Lu Zhenglian
to the Flower on the Wall case.

00:11:31.985 --> 00:11:33.305
She's after the Xiuhong House?

00:11:33.385 --> 00:11:34.305
That's right.

00:11:34.945 --> 00:11:36.705
So she wouldn't kill Lu Zhenglian.

00:11:37.305 --> 00:11:39.065
I also find it strange.

00:11:39.145 --> 00:11:43.305
But the Inner Guards and a dozen people
from the Court of Judicial Review

00:11:43.385 --> 00:11:47.745
claim to have seen Her Ladyship
kill Lu Zhenglian with their own eyes.

00:11:51.905 --> 00:11:54.625
It seems that Peiyi
has hit their sore spot.

00:11:54.705 --> 00:11:58.385
They probably want
to leave themselves a way out.

00:11:58.465 --> 00:12:01.425
And they were afraid
that you would dig deeper.

00:12:01.505 --> 00:12:02.705
However, with this development,

00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:06.345
things will be even trickier
for Her Ladyship.

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:11.385
Look into it.

00:12:11.465 --> 00:12:12.985
I'd like to see

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:15.705
if they can wrongfully condemn
my County Princess to death.

00:12:15.785 --> 00:12:18.865
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:12:30.185 --> 00:12:31.945
Congratulations, Inspector Lu.

00:12:32.025 --> 00:12:33.145
What did His Majesty say?

00:12:33.745 --> 00:12:35.025
His Majesty?

00:12:35.105 --> 00:12:37.425
Such trivial matters
need not trouble His Majesty.

00:12:38.745 --> 00:12:40.785
Your retirement request has been approved.

00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:43.385
You may retire and return
to your hometown tomorrow

00:12:43.465 --> 00:12:44.945
to enjoy a life of leisure.

00:12:45.025 --> 00:12:46.345
What did you say?

00:12:46.865 --> 00:12:48.865
We haven't received
any response for months.

00:12:49.465 --> 00:12:52.225
But now, you're driving him away
with Her Ladyship wrongfully imprisoned.

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:53.505
You scoundrels.

00:12:54.665 --> 00:12:56.865
This was decided
by the Ministry of Personnel.

00:12:56.945 --> 00:12:59.185
They rushed me here,
fearing that Inspector Lu

00:12:59.265 --> 00:13:01.065
had been exhausted from hard work.

00:13:01.145 --> 00:13:03.305
I made this trip out of goodwill.

00:13:03.385 --> 00:13:05.625
Why am I being scolded?

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:08.385
I failed to discipline my people.

00:13:08.465 --> 00:13:10.225
My sincere apologies.

00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:11.985
Seriously.

00:13:15.825 --> 00:13:18.745
Do me a favor. Don't stoop to her level.

00:13:20.665 --> 00:13:22.345
I will take my leave.

00:13:24.745 --> 00:13:26.465
What is her problem?

00:13:27.945 --> 00:13:29.345
What do we do now?

00:13:29.425 --> 00:13:32.465
The Court of Judicial Review
will be busy tonight.

00:13:55.265 --> 00:13:57.545
Your Ladyship. Eat something.

00:14:11.105 --> 00:14:12.145
Why the long face?

00:14:13.425 --> 00:14:14.545
Don't worry.

00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:15.745
I'm fine.

00:14:17.985 --> 00:14:19.705
It's different this time.

00:14:20.385 --> 00:14:21.345
How?

00:14:23.985 --> 00:14:24.905
Your Ladyship.

00:14:25.545 --> 00:14:27.905
In the past, no matter
how outrageous you were

00:14:27.985 --> 00:14:28.985
and what trouble you caused,

00:14:29.585 --> 00:14:32.945
His Majesty would only summon you
to scold you or ground you.

00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:36.785
How come he actually put you
in prison this time?

00:14:38.985 --> 00:14:42.185
Maybe I messed up way too badly this time.

00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:48.705
Your Ladyship.

00:14:49.825 --> 00:14:51.465
Stop investigating, alright?

00:14:52.185 --> 00:14:55.945
Go and tell His Majesty
that the case can be closed.

00:14:57.345 --> 00:14:59.625
Then maybe they'll let you go?

00:15:00.825 --> 00:15:02.025
What's wrong with you?

00:15:04.145 --> 00:15:05.465
I'm scared.

00:15:08.385 --> 00:15:10.105
They put you in prison,

00:15:10.665 --> 00:15:14.305
forced Inspector Lu to retire,
and dismissed Prosecutor Gu.

00:15:14.905 --> 00:15:16.745
They've killed so many people,

00:15:17.265 --> 00:15:19.585
but we don't even know who they are.

00:15:21.025 --> 00:15:22.185
What if…

00:15:22.265 --> 00:15:25.745
What if they want you dead
out of desperation?

00:15:25.825 --> 00:15:27.425
What would I do then?

00:15:37.545 --> 00:15:38.385
Don't be afraid.

00:15:39.665 --> 00:15:43.665
If they want me dead,
they won't spare your life.

00:15:52.505 --> 00:15:53.585
Your Majesty.

00:15:54.265 --> 00:15:57.145
Lu Zhenglian's case
has wide-reaching implications.

00:15:57.225 --> 00:15:58.825
Her Ladyship is involved.

00:15:58.905 --> 00:16:00.185
So is the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:16:00.265 --> 00:16:03.585
We should entrust this to someone reliable

00:16:04.225 --> 00:16:05.545
to bring it to a conclusion.

00:16:06.185 --> 00:16:08.665
Who do you recommend for this task?

00:16:09.585 --> 00:16:11.905
The Palace Investigation Bureau
should be in charge.

00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:14.385
But Inspector Du has just retired.

00:16:14.985 --> 00:16:17.625
Her Ladyship may hold
no substantive position,

00:16:17.705 --> 00:16:18.825
but her status is esteemed.

00:16:18.905 --> 00:16:22.145
It's inappropriate to have subordinates
investigate their superior.

00:16:22.825 --> 00:16:24.385
Meanwhile,

00:16:25.545 --> 00:16:29.185
the Court of Judicial Review
isn't fit for this job.

00:16:29.265 --> 00:16:32.225
The officials
cannot freely enter the palace.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:33.785
It's really tricky.

00:16:35.065 --> 00:16:37.905
So, according to you,
no one can take on this case?

00:16:39.425 --> 00:16:40.505
I am dull-witted.

00:16:40.585 --> 00:16:43.025
I truly cannot think
of a suitable candidate.

00:16:46.785 --> 00:16:49.625
Does anyone want to volunteer?

00:16:56.505 --> 00:16:58.945
I volunteer to investigate the case.

00:17:08.865 --> 00:17:11.305
I, Xiao Huaijin,
Deputy Director of Astronomy,

00:17:11.385 --> 00:17:12.545
bore the qilin badge

00:17:12.625 --> 00:17:14.944
to help Her Ladyship investigate
the Flower on the Wall case.

00:17:15.025 --> 00:17:18.665
Lu Zhenglian is closely related
to Hanxiao, the deceased.

00:17:18.745 --> 00:17:20.665
It is within the purview of my duties.

00:17:20.745 --> 00:17:22.224
I beg for your permission.

00:17:28.385 --> 00:17:29.985
I was right about you.

00:17:30.065 --> 00:17:31.305
I'll leave it to you.

00:17:31.385 --> 00:17:32.705
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:17:35.665 --> 00:17:37.825
Congratulations, Grand Tutor,

00:17:37.905 --> 00:17:39.905
on having such a capable son.

00:17:54.465 --> 00:17:56.585
I sent you to the Astronomical Bureau

00:17:56.665 --> 00:17:59.265
precisely to keep you away
from court disputes.

00:17:59.785 --> 00:18:01.465
Why won't you listen?

00:18:01.545 --> 00:18:04.585
How is the investigation
related to court disputes?

00:18:04.665 --> 00:18:06.025
Stop playing dumb.

00:18:07.065 --> 00:18:09.625
They put Her Ladyship
in prison for murder.

00:18:10.385 --> 00:18:11.825
How can you contend with them?

00:18:16.425 --> 00:18:17.665
Since you know who they are,

00:18:17.745 --> 00:18:20.985
why not just tell me
so I can solve the case sooner

00:18:21.065 --> 00:18:22.425
and spare you the anxiety?

00:18:22.505 --> 00:18:23.825
You…

00:18:26.065 --> 00:18:28.905
I have no interest in court affairs.
I'm an inspector.

00:18:28.985 --> 00:18:32.265
The case you're investigating
is all about a court affair.

00:18:32.785 --> 00:18:36.945
If you fail to find evidence
to free Her Ladyship,

00:18:37.585 --> 00:18:39.225
you will be implicated.

00:18:39.945 --> 00:18:41.665
And if you actually solve the case,

00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:45.785
you'll be telling His Majesty
that these people are ganging up.

00:18:49.985 --> 00:18:52.065
- What?
- Father.

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:53.905
Don't tell me…

00:18:53.985 --> 00:18:55.065
Nonsense.

00:18:55.585 --> 00:18:57.065
How could I visit such a filthy place?

00:18:59.745 --> 00:19:01.465
Then I am relieved.

00:19:13.425 --> 00:19:14.425
Here comes my savior.

00:19:17.145 --> 00:19:18.105
We don't have much time.

00:19:18.185 --> 00:19:20.985
Someone in the Xiuhong House
must know who the patrons are.

00:19:21.065 --> 00:19:22.305
We need that list as soon as possible.

00:19:23.345 --> 00:19:26.225
Aren't you assigned
to Lu Zhenglian's murder?

00:19:26.305 --> 00:19:27.545
What about the Xiuhong House?

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:28.865
They framed you

00:19:28.945 --> 00:19:30.745
to stop your investigation
into the Xiuhong House.

00:19:30.825 --> 00:19:33.185
Because something
about that case terrifies them.

00:19:33.265 --> 00:19:35.105
As long as we obtain it,

00:19:35.185 --> 00:19:37.625
they will tell the truth out of fear.

00:19:39.145 --> 00:19:40.465
I knew I was right about you.

00:19:41.105 --> 00:19:42.425
Who should we consult?

00:19:45.265 --> 00:19:46.305
Ruyi.

00:19:47.545 --> 00:19:49.625
I know you are with
the Astronomical Bureau.

00:19:50.865 --> 00:19:52.385
I also like the stars.

00:19:52.465 --> 00:19:55.505
But the stars are too far away from me.

00:19:57.185 --> 00:20:00.345
When I was little, my mother taught me

00:20:02.065 --> 00:20:04.825
to hold my hand like this.

00:20:06.465 --> 00:20:08.345
Look through this small hole

00:20:09.385 --> 00:20:10.865
and you can see the stars.

00:20:12.785 --> 00:20:15.225
I got over all those nights

00:20:16.425 --> 00:20:18.425
at the Xiuhong House

00:20:18.505 --> 00:20:21.905
by looking at the stars
and thinking of my mother.

00:20:24.025 --> 00:20:24.985
I was right about you too.

00:20:26.465 --> 00:20:27.665
Wait for me.

00:20:40.785 --> 00:20:42.265
You can't see the sky from here.

00:20:42.785 --> 00:20:44.345
Ruyi couldn't have seen the stars.

00:20:45.105 --> 00:20:46.425
She lied to us.

00:20:47.105 --> 00:20:48.185
She left us a clue.

00:21:05.425 --> 00:21:06.265
Found it.

00:21:09.985 --> 00:21:10.825
This is…

00:21:10.905 --> 00:21:12.065
Elephant Ear.

00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:13.665
This plant drips water at night.

00:21:13.745 --> 00:21:15.625
This is the "star" Ruyi spoke of.

00:21:21.465 --> 00:21:22.305
Don't open it.

00:21:24.185 --> 00:21:27.025
Only His Majesty can read the list.

00:21:31.145 --> 00:21:32.585
ZICHEN HALL

00:21:43.145 --> 00:21:46.545
I have presented the chest to His Majesty.

00:21:47.545 --> 00:21:48.785
Mr. Xiao.

00:21:48.865 --> 00:21:51.785
The night is chilly.
Go home and get some rest.

00:21:51.865 --> 00:21:55.585
His Majesty will surely
summon you tomorrow morning.

00:21:59.745 --> 00:22:00.585
Thank you, Eunuch Guo.

00:22:08.185 --> 00:22:09.425
Hurry. Hurry.

00:22:09.505 --> 00:22:11.425
- What happened?
- There's a fire.

00:22:14.825 --> 00:22:16.105
Put out the fire.

00:22:17.425 --> 00:22:19.545
Careful. Be careful.

00:22:20.585 --> 00:22:21.425
Mr. Xiao.

00:22:22.065 --> 00:22:23.025
Is His Majesty alright?

00:22:23.105 --> 00:22:24.745
His Majesty is alright.

00:22:24.825 --> 00:22:27.825
It's just that Consort Shu's cat
knocked over a candlestick.

00:22:27.905 --> 00:22:30.825
Some memorials got burned.
Everything else is fine.

00:22:31.825 --> 00:22:32.665
What about the chest?

00:22:33.465 --> 00:22:34.465
Mr. Xiao.

00:22:35.065 --> 00:22:38.505
His Majesty is well aware
of your great merit.

00:22:48.945 --> 00:22:53.465
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:23:02.025 --> 00:23:03.065
When did she come back?

00:23:04.825 --> 00:23:05.705
Early this morning.

00:23:05.785 --> 00:23:07.905
One of the jailers
escorting Lu Zhenglian survived

00:23:07.985 --> 00:23:09.705
and witnessed the entire incident.

00:23:09.785 --> 00:23:11.625
He finally regained consciousness

00:23:12.225 --> 00:23:13.585
and testified for Her Ladyship.

00:23:14.425 --> 00:23:15.265
How convenient.

00:23:16.265 --> 00:23:17.825
Wasn't last night's fire convenient?

00:23:21.265 --> 00:23:22.865
How long will she keep venting?

00:23:24.785 --> 00:23:25.825
Probably…

00:23:28.625 --> 00:23:30.465
Probably, another hour will be enough.

00:23:41.345 --> 00:23:43.265
If you don't want to drink,

00:23:43.985 --> 00:23:45.465
you don't have to sit here.

00:23:47.225 --> 00:23:48.785
If I'm not mistaken,

00:23:48.865 --> 00:23:51.385
that list contains the names
of many high-ranking officials.

00:23:51.465 --> 00:23:53.265
Dealing with them

00:23:53.345 --> 00:23:56.545
might disturb the court
and the entire nation.

00:23:56.625 --> 00:23:58.905
Besides, the flood
in the south is ongoing.

00:23:58.985 --> 00:24:00.625
The court is in dire need of talent.

00:24:01.305 --> 00:24:04.145
His Majesty did this
for the bigger picture.

00:24:06.545 --> 00:24:07.385
Indeed.

00:24:08.545 --> 00:24:10.025
Thankfully, the cat was smart

00:24:10.105 --> 00:24:12.145
and maintained world peace.

00:24:17.705 --> 00:24:20.905
His Majesty did this also to protect you.

00:24:23.465 --> 00:24:26.705
But the ones who need protection
are not me.

00:24:27.265 --> 00:24:29.545
It's those former palace maids
who were finally freed

00:24:29.625 --> 00:24:32.465
from years of servitude,
only to be deceived, toyed with,

00:24:32.545 --> 00:24:33.705
and abused.

00:24:34.785 --> 00:24:35.945
The nation needs peace.

00:24:36.705 --> 00:24:38.145
The court needs pillars.

00:24:38.825 --> 00:24:40.265
But now, those pillars are rotten.

00:24:42.505 --> 00:24:43.945
How can the nation ever attain peace?

00:24:48.865 --> 00:24:50.825
Boss. Lou Chuo is dead.

00:25:07.065 --> 00:25:10.705
XIA, 13TH YEAR OF DALI

00:25:25.905 --> 00:25:26.945
Come on.

00:25:27.785 --> 00:25:29.105
To Your Highness.

00:25:29.185 --> 00:25:31.065
To you, Mr. Yu.

00:25:31.145 --> 00:25:33.545
Thanks to your mediation,

00:25:34.065 --> 00:25:36.985
we're able to keep drinking
and having fun here.

00:25:37.505 --> 00:25:41.385
PRINCE OF HENG, LI DUO

00:25:48.825 --> 00:25:52.945
Li Peiyi ruined my plans.

00:25:53.465 --> 00:25:56.825
She's lucky that Father kept her safe.

00:25:57.345 --> 00:26:00.345
Otherwise, I would have killed her.

00:26:01.145 --> 00:26:03.425
His Majesty has always favored her.

00:26:03.505 --> 00:26:06.225
Please don't let her bother you.

00:26:06.305 --> 00:26:11.145
But what is His Majesty
doing with Xiao Huaijin?

00:26:11.225 --> 00:26:14.025
He sent Xiao Wenyuan's son
to investigate us.

00:26:14.545 --> 00:26:15.745
What's his intention?

00:26:18.025 --> 00:26:20.065
No matter His Majesty's intention,

00:26:20.665 --> 00:26:23.385
anyone who stops me from making money

00:26:23.945 --> 00:26:26.625
or enjoying myself will pay the price.

00:26:29.905 --> 00:26:32.665
Yuchun House has some new girls.

00:26:32.745 --> 00:26:35.825
If you're both interested,
I can summon them.

00:26:37.425 --> 00:26:38.385
Forget it.

00:26:38.905 --> 00:26:40.265
We have plenty of girls.

00:27:09.225 --> 00:27:11.145
Let's call it a day. I'm off.

00:27:11.665 --> 00:27:13.065
Your Highness, wait.

00:27:13.785 --> 00:27:14.705
We're waiting for someone.

00:27:14.785 --> 00:27:17.705
Who dares to make me wait?

00:27:18.305 --> 00:27:20.705
- I'm done.
- Your Highness, please stay.

00:27:26.825 --> 00:27:28.785
What brings you here?

00:27:29.385 --> 00:27:31.505
I know you've been missing me.

00:27:31.585 --> 00:27:33.545
So I came as soon as I could.

00:27:33.625 --> 00:27:35.025
‪Yuck!

00:27:35.105 --> 00:27:36.545
I didn't even think of you.

00:27:40.225 --> 00:27:41.585
You came empty-handed?

00:27:42.185 --> 00:27:44.985
I've prepared some exceptional flowers
for Your Highness.

00:27:45.065 --> 00:27:46.425
What flowers?

00:28:10.345 --> 00:28:12.025
Lotus blossoms in clear water.

00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:15.105
Fabulous.

00:28:15.185 --> 00:28:16.425
Fabulous.

00:29:27.025 --> 00:29:28.065
Your Ladyship.

00:29:29.945 --> 00:29:32.185
How much did you drink?

00:29:33.225 --> 00:29:34.345
Your Ladyship.

00:29:36.465 --> 00:29:37.545
What?

00:29:37.625 --> 00:29:38.465
There's a case.

00:29:39.185 --> 00:29:41.025
- I'm on leave.
- A major case.

00:29:41.105 --> 00:29:42.985
Prince of Heng died
at Mr. Yang's residence.

00:29:43.065 --> 00:29:44.585
A dozen dancing girls
and the Vice Minister

00:29:44.665 --> 00:29:45.865
of Personnel also died there.

00:29:48.625 --> 00:29:50.105
Still, none of my business.

00:29:50.185 --> 00:29:51.145
Find the Chief Justice.

00:29:52.305 --> 00:29:54.905
People who've been to the scene say
that Prince of Heng had a huge scar.

00:29:56.625 --> 00:29:58.945
Hanxiao didn't know who he was,

00:30:00.065 --> 00:30:01.465
but during the struggle,

00:30:02.265 --> 00:30:06.385
she saw a huge scar
on the inside of his wrist.

00:30:07.465 --> 00:30:08.505
Let's go.

00:30:12.305 --> 00:30:13.985
What did you do to Mr. Xiao?

00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:21.065
Your Ladyship.

00:30:22.505 --> 00:30:23.985
I'm fine. Go to rest.

00:30:24.625 --> 00:30:26.185
Mr. Xiao is here.

00:30:35.825 --> 00:30:36.945
Come in.

00:30:37.025 --> 00:30:39.305
I'll leave soon so as not to disturb you.

00:30:39.385 --> 00:30:42.945
You've been on leave
since the fire at the Imperial Study.

00:30:43.465 --> 00:30:46.905
I don't think you need me
for anything else.

00:30:47.585 --> 00:30:49.265
So I'm returning the qilin badge.

00:30:49.345 --> 00:30:51.105
And I came to inform you.

00:31:02.865 --> 00:31:04.025
Have a drink.

00:31:10.465 --> 00:31:12.945
I saw Birou at the west market yesterday.

00:31:14.265 --> 00:31:15.145
She's back?

00:31:15.745 --> 00:31:16.705
That's right.

00:31:17.425 --> 00:31:18.585
But she seemed weird.

00:31:19.825 --> 00:31:20.785
She wanted to avoid you?

00:31:21.545 --> 00:31:22.665
That's right.

00:31:24.745 --> 00:31:26.105
She always felt she wronged you.

00:31:28.145 --> 00:31:29.545
She has a conscience.

00:31:30.625 --> 00:31:33.305
People with a conscience
live very hard lives.

00:31:34.585 --> 00:31:35.425
What about you?

00:31:42.225 --> 00:31:43.985
You seem rather tired.

00:31:50.225 --> 00:31:53.505
You've done your best
about the Xiuhong House case.

00:31:53.585 --> 00:31:57.065
His Majesty did his best too.

00:32:03.785 --> 00:32:05.185
Fifteen years ago,

00:32:05.265 --> 00:32:07.265
on a night with a full moon,

00:32:08.265 --> 00:32:11.945
I was ill and stayed in the palace.
My family was massacred that night.

00:32:12.745 --> 00:32:14.865
Over 100 people
in the household were all killed.

00:32:16.905 --> 00:32:19.185
The Court of Judicial Review
"did their best".

00:32:19.265 --> 00:32:21.105
The Palace Investigation Bureau
"did their best".

00:32:21.865 --> 00:32:23.905
Consort Shu said
His Majesty "did his best".

00:32:25.105 --> 00:32:26.825
But what counts as doing one's best?

00:32:31.305 --> 00:32:32.825
Please don't pity me.

00:32:33.865 --> 00:32:37.385
I just want to say
that I didn't do my best.

00:32:42.665 --> 00:32:44.465
You came to bid me farewell.

00:32:44.545 --> 00:32:45.425
At least, it's a closure.

00:32:46.305 --> 00:32:49.545
Thank you for your help
in the past few months.

00:32:50.345 --> 00:32:51.425
It's late.

00:32:52.265 --> 00:32:53.225
See yourself out.

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:21.905
Your Ladyship.

00:33:21.985 --> 00:33:25.425
You can say that His Majesty
was shielding those people.

00:33:25.505 --> 00:33:28.585
But he did save you
by suppressing the truth.

00:33:28.665 --> 00:33:30.305
Perhaps to His Majesty,

00:33:30.825 --> 00:33:33.745
there are paths to justice
that lie beyond the one you perceive.

00:33:35.065 --> 00:33:36.825
Why are you making me sound unreasonable?

00:33:36.905 --> 00:33:38.025
Inspector Du,

00:33:38.105 --> 00:33:39.785
Wuren, Prosecutor Gu,

00:33:40.585 --> 00:33:41.825
and me.

00:33:42.905 --> 00:33:45.305
We are with you.

00:33:46.705 --> 00:33:48.785
Being with me only brings you trouble.

00:33:49.305 --> 00:33:51.105
You have to return
the qilin badge, anyway.

00:33:51.945 --> 00:33:53.265
You still don't trust me.

00:33:55.865 --> 00:33:57.545
All feasts must come to an end.

00:33:58.785 --> 00:34:00.465
Deputy Director Xiao. I toast to you.

00:34:04.945 --> 00:34:08.105
Now, can you trust me?

00:34:11.304 --> 00:34:13.065
I have no qilin badge to return.

00:34:16.145 --> 00:34:18.025
I wish to stand by your side.

00:34:33.744 --> 00:34:34.905
The person you are

00:34:35.425 --> 00:34:37.705
has little to do with the face
you show the world

00:34:37.784 --> 00:34:42.145
or the lady the world believes you to be.

00:34:46.025 --> 00:34:48.264
I dare not claim to know you,

00:34:48.344 --> 00:34:50.145
but I know your character.

00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:53.824
Thank you, Deputy Director Xiao.

00:34:58.425 --> 00:35:01.705
The way you address me
shows that you still don't trust me.

00:35:05.145 --> 00:35:05.985
Mr. Xiao.

00:35:30.425 --> 00:35:31.545
You're not heartless.

00:35:32.545 --> 00:35:34.105
You just hate to hide your thoughts.

00:35:34.705 --> 00:35:37.585
Who doesn't have
disgraceful thoughts and stories?

00:35:38.185 --> 00:35:39.025
Your Ladyship.

00:35:39.825 --> 00:35:43.065
You don't hide your thoughts,
nor do you flaunt your kindness.

00:35:43.145 --> 00:35:44.905
For this, I respect you.

00:36:03.945 --> 00:36:05.025
Cheers.

00:36:16.825 --> 00:36:19.185
Mr. Xiao. Are you drunk?

00:36:23.385 --> 00:36:25.145
I have indeed drunk too much.

00:36:25.665 --> 00:36:27.065
I'll take my leave now.

00:37:51.145 --> 00:37:53.305
He actually used
the "heart-to-heart" tactic.

00:37:53.385 --> 00:37:55.705
Poor Deputy Director Xiao.

00:37:55.785 --> 00:37:57.945
He must have poured his heart out to you.

00:37:58.025 --> 00:37:59.745
I poured my heart out too.

00:37:59.825 --> 00:38:01.185
You…

00:38:02.105 --> 00:38:03.305
are heartless.

00:38:08.105 --> 00:38:10.225
Look what you did to Deputy Director Xiao.

00:38:11.465 --> 00:38:13.785
He is highly perceptive.
How can I fool him?

00:38:19.105 --> 00:38:20.625
Deputy Director Xiao…

00:38:20.705 --> 00:38:22.145
No. Mr. Xiao.

00:38:23.025 --> 00:38:25.185
There's a murder case
at Vice Minister Yang's residence.

00:38:25.265 --> 00:38:26.385
We have to go.

00:38:27.265 --> 00:38:29.625
Come find us when you're ready.

00:38:55.345 --> 00:38:56.505
Your Ladyship.

00:38:58.025 --> 00:39:01.065
Last night, Mr. Yang secretly invited
Prince of Heng and Vice Minister Yu over

00:39:01.145 --> 00:39:02.625
to discuss "important matters".

00:39:02.705 --> 00:39:04.585
They forbade servants
from the back courtyard

00:39:04.665 --> 00:39:06.505
and kept only the dancing girls.

00:39:07.105 --> 00:39:08.705
Which establishment are they from?

00:39:08.785 --> 00:39:09.945
They are in-house dancers.

00:39:11.105 --> 00:39:12.505
In-house?

00:39:12.585 --> 00:39:13.545
Can we identify them?

00:39:13.625 --> 00:39:15.865
Their faces are swollen
beyond recognition.

00:39:15.945 --> 00:39:17.105
What about their master?

00:39:17.705 --> 00:39:20.545
Someone brought these girls over
with a code phrase.

00:39:20.625 --> 00:39:23.665
The servants didn't know
who he was and dared not ask.

00:39:24.505 --> 00:39:26.705
The deceased
have bluish lips and fingernails.

00:39:26.785 --> 00:39:28.785
Their bodies are stiff.
It should be poisoning.

00:39:28.865 --> 00:39:31.145
But the wine, food,

00:39:31.225 --> 00:39:33.825
incense, and candles
have all been inspected.

00:39:34.345 --> 00:39:36.305
- Non-toxic?
- That's right.

00:39:38.465 --> 00:39:40.105
What about the pool water?

00:39:40.185 --> 00:39:41.465
We checked it.

00:39:41.545 --> 00:39:43.065
But it's strange.

00:39:43.145 --> 00:39:45.665
The water contains toxins
in trace amounts.

00:39:45.745 --> 00:39:47.385
To poison all these people,

00:39:47.465 --> 00:39:49.145
they'd have to drink the entire pool dry.

00:39:49.225 --> 00:39:51.625
Or perhaps after they were poisoned,

00:39:51.705 --> 00:39:53.425
the murderer poured the residual
into the pool.

00:39:54.305 --> 00:39:55.905
Their times of death are similar.

00:39:55.985 --> 00:39:57.265
They were poisoned almost simultaneously.

00:39:57.345 --> 00:39:58.825
But their throats aren't blackened.

00:39:58.905 --> 00:40:00.865
So the poison wasn't ingested orally.

00:40:01.865 --> 00:40:03.625
Did they actually die from the bath?

00:40:07.025 --> 00:40:08.345
What's this fancy thing?

00:40:08.425 --> 00:40:10.745
It's the steam bath
introduced from the Western Regions.

00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:13.345
Light a fire under the stone stove
to heat the stones,

00:40:13.425 --> 00:40:17.145
then pour water over them
to produce steam.

00:40:17.225 --> 00:40:18.425
People sit in the steam.

00:40:18.505 --> 00:40:20.425
It's said to improve blood circulation.

00:40:23.505 --> 00:40:25.465
It's quite fashionable lately.

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:29.305
That's impressive.

00:40:29.385 --> 00:40:30.665
You've solved the case.

00:40:31.705 --> 00:40:32.945
Huh?

00:40:33.025 --> 00:40:34.625
I have? How?

00:40:35.665 --> 00:40:37.825
They inhaled the poison.

00:40:39.585 --> 00:40:41.065
Have you identified the poison?

00:40:41.145 --> 00:40:42.825
Judging by their symptoms,

00:40:42.905 --> 00:40:44.745
it should be a blend of several poisons.

00:40:44.825 --> 00:40:47.865
But the poison in the pool
is heavily diluted

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:48.985
and hard to detect.

00:40:49.665 --> 00:40:51.945
Take the water to Inspector Du.
He'll figure it out.

00:40:52.665 --> 00:40:54.745
Inspector Du has retired.

00:40:55.425 --> 00:40:56.585
So he has time now.

00:41:00.105 --> 00:41:00.945
Mr. Xiao.

00:41:02.665 --> 00:41:03.545
Your Ladyship.

00:41:04.065 --> 00:41:06.105
This bathhouse seems strange to me.

00:41:06.185 --> 00:41:07.145
But I can't tell why.

00:41:26.385 --> 00:41:27.625
Come on.

00:41:30.145 --> 00:41:31.545
Great wine.

00:41:31.625 --> 00:41:32.665
Cheers.

00:41:40.825 --> 00:41:41.865
There.

00:41:42.705 --> 00:41:43.865
One person is missing.

00:41:53.505 --> 00:41:56.625
The gatekeeper said that a man came
with those dancers at first,

00:41:56.705 --> 00:41:58.065
but left early.

00:41:58.145 --> 00:42:00.585
He thought he was just a servant
escorting the girls.

00:42:00.665 --> 00:42:01.905
That was the murderer?

00:42:02.945 --> 00:42:04.065
We don't know.

00:42:04.145 --> 00:42:05.585
But that man must be poisoned too.

00:42:06.185 --> 00:42:07.705
The murderer dispersed the poison

00:42:08.425 --> 00:42:10.185
into the air with the steam.

00:42:10.265 --> 00:42:12.905
Prince of Heng, the two vice ministers,
and six dancers

00:42:12.985 --> 00:42:14.625
who were in the room from the beginning

00:42:14.705 --> 00:42:15.985
were most heavily poisoned.

00:42:16.065 --> 00:42:16.945
The man we are looking for

00:42:17.025 --> 00:42:19.305
was the last to arrive
and was only lightly poisoned.

00:42:20.025 --> 00:42:21.985
But while running out,
the poison kicked in.

00:42:22.585 --> 00:42:23.985
The lamps in the corridor
were knocked over.

00:42:24.065 --> 00:42:26.465
I bet he knocked them over
while stumbling out.

00:42:27.185 --> 00:42:28.705
Find the officials who took leave today.

00:42:28.785 --> 00:42:30.305
Sick leave or personal leave.

00:42:30.385 --> 00:42:31.705
See them in person.

00:42:31.785 --> 00:42:34.425
Those who don't show up
will receive a visit from us.

00:42:34.505 --> 00:42:35.345
Understood.

00:42:35.425 --> 00:42:37.465
That man sat between
the two vice ministers

00:42:37.545 --> 00:42:38.465
in the seat of honor.

00:42:39.345 --> 00:42:40.625
Then it's even simpler.

00:42:40.705 --> 00:42:42.505
Check officials
of the fourth rank and above.

00:42:45.225 --> 00:42:46.185
Thought of something?

00:42:47.185 --> 00:42:49.025
No. Nothing.

00:43:04.065 --> 00:43:05.105
Prosecutor Gu?

00:43:09.745 --> 00:43:10.745
Lady Wuren.

00:43:11.465 --> 00:43:13.225
Why are you moving corpses here?

00:43:15.105 --> 00:43:16.745
I was dismissed and made a commoner.

00:43:17.345 --> 00:43:20.265
But I heard that someone
spoke up for me to Chief Minister Wu.

00:43:20.345 --> 00:43:22.545
So I'm allowed to stay.

00:43:22.625 --> 00:43:24.985
Now, I'm just a petty clerk.

00:43:25.065 --> 00:43:27.105
This is part of my job.

00:43:30.025 --> 00:43:31.825
Your Ladyship. Deputy Director Xiao.

00:43:32.905 --> 00:43:34.105
Your Ladyship.

00:43:34.625 --> 00:43:36.265
How can we help Mr. Gu?

00:43:36.345 --> 00:43:38.385
I was at fault. I deserve it.

00:43:38.465 --> 00:43:40.985
I believe that I'm allowed to stay

00:43:41.065 --> 00:43:43.385
and work here thanks to you two.

00:43:44.665 --> 00:43:46.465
You may have injured someone,

00:43:47.065 --> 00:43:48.385
but you had your reason.

00:43:48.465 --> 00:43:51.825
How did our internal dispute
disrupt the Ministry of Personnel?
