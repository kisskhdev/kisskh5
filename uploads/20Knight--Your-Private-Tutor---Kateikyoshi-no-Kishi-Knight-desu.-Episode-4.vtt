00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.940
My name is Toru Takasugi.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.460
3rd year at Omori High School, Bali

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.260
He's a Balinese Yankee.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.680
Hey, this sweat is my island

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.760
I guess that's why.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.040
Is it an island?

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.000
Sweat belongs to everyone

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.200
reactor.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.960
Where is zare or zari?

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.520
You're free to fish for crabs.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.920
ah?

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.100
Hey, I said I was asleep.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.760
Not you.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.780
It's time to leave

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.340
That's it.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.820
That will wake you up.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.300
Looks like Sakuraeli

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.440
Do it!

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.080
Hey, what a bastard.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.860
What is this?

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.820
Sakuraeri.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.120
No matter how unreasonable the noise

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.200
I buy what is sold even in a fight.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.860
Among men,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.640
No, among the Yankees

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.960
Yankee common sense.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.180
Hey, what a bastard.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.060
I'm doing it again.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.980
hey.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.160
Don't be silly.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.040
Oh, it's time for the inn.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.620
picture?

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.290
What time is it now?

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.670
picture?

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.890
Oh, seriously?

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.670
Hey, I'm going home.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.790
Hey, it's you, you.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.130
Hey, come on, you come on.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.250
Yo.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.090
I'm not going.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.530
why.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.430
Seriously, this sweat fluid

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.390
Because it belongs to everyone.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.070
See you then.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.670
Oh, hey, hey, don't run away.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.270
hey hey.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.380
No matter how unreasonable the noise

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.660
I buy what is sold even in a fight.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.680
Among men,

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.500
No, among the Yankees

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.160
Yankee common sense.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.220
It's open.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.960
It was supposed to be.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.520
Kishigishi becomes a tutor

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.180
Until I get there.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.480
Buggy.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.780
Chinese?

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.700
yes.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.060
What does Toro-kun do?

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.180
Is there a Chinese sentence that says?

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.920
Delcam…

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.700
a!

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:43.650
I love you, please

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.470
I love you, huh?

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.810
By no means a miracle worker

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.330
Did you receive it?

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.210
I didn't tell you!

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.370
That's amazing, Touroku

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.790
yeah!

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.390
I can write such difficult kanji

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.750
What!

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.350
Ma…

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.530
Well...

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.810
Yankees are around here

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.930
There's a guy who can't read Chinese.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.110
Is that so?

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.350
Yankees are amazing

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.750
That's right!

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.510
It's playful!

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.670
but…

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.990
I love you too

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.370
Isn't that also Chinese?

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.330
Is it wrong?

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.010
Yes, these kanji are correct.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.310
Touro is called teji.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.050
kun likes kanji

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.410
What is it?

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.690
Anything cool

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.450
I like it, that's good

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.430
Right, Touro-kun too?

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:47.040
It's cool, isn't it?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.660
teeth…

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.740
Small fish Tenkakoi are running alone

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.960
oh!

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.060
Those are the words of Buddha.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.420
That's nice, Touro-kunpi.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.120
It's tough!

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.960
Kixie, only I am the best

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.160
Strong is a famous saying, right?

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.180
Super cool!

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.900
That's a little different, isn't it?

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.720
The leaves are my existence in this world.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.360
There's only one person left

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.100
It is said to be a priceless and precious existence.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:31.730
What do you mean? Yes, what do you mean?

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.080
And this one is also technically Han.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.120
It can't be called a sentence, han.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.720
A sentence is written using kanji.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.080
written in Chinese grammar

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.260
What does it refer to?

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.340
So it's a spell, right?

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.320
It looks like a spell now

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.960
Motouro-kun's name

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.980
You will be able to read it more easily.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.900
Uro-kun's growth

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.440
It's totally fine if it's okay.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.640
Yes, the end of term is almost here

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.600
It's a test, so let's do our best together.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:20.750
Let's hang it up, okay?

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.370
Touro-kun's story ah,

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.510
What's going on earlier?

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.370
Well, it's just a fight, so no worries.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.550
Wow?

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.450
Touro-kun is fighting

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.090
Have you come?

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.810
Almost any unreasonable thing

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.430
Even in a fight I was sold

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.410
I'm buying this Yankee

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:48.290
Is that common sense?

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.210
Maybe it's a squishy noise

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.910
Have you ever had a fight?

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.270
No, it's not sold.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.930
Have you never done it?

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:06.330
No, I'm sure it's because I'm weak.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.630
The crab looks weak

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.890
Everyone is more bored than me

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:13.210
It is clear that it may be possible

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.170
picking a fight with the weak

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.150
It is a cowardly thing to do

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:28.610
That's why

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.250
Wow, this is the way

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.950
This body hidden in plain sight

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.210
Look at me, so hit me.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.150
hit?

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.610
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.170
I'm strong and say hit me

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.490
Even if it's from, it's okay!

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.490
Seriously, it's okay!

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.750
So feel free to say wow!

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.310
face!

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.870
picture?

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.990
No, just a fist punch

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.490
Right!

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.350
Is that so?

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.270
Sorry, I'm training my nose too.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.310
I thought, no, I have to

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:10.730
Hey!

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.790
That's right, miracle

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:14.650
There's blood on your shirt

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.210
Why not!

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.590
This is totally fine, that's it.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.430
Tork's nose...

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.390
No, I'm Tisci

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.050
If you want to attack with

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.770
Stop, come on, stop.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.450
You're right, take that off.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.630
Let mom wash it

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:39.200
Sorry Kiseki-chan,

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.860
The unexpected weakness is

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.440
Wet!?

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.200
Tork, help me!

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.700
my tutor idiot

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.160
Don't listen!

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.830
Yes, sorry, please borrow it.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.570
It's perfectly fine to put it away.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.230
My nosebleeds have stopped

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.850
That was really good.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:18.090
Let's be sweet with your words

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:25.780
What?

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.200
Huh?

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.380
Moe!

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.740
This is gap moe!

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.020
kisishishishishishi

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:44.440
That's true, it's a mistake

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.860
It's too cute

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.640
Which is this...

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.410
Sorry, sweats

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.010
I don't usually wear it so I'm excited

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.110
Shi, I have an unexpected weakness.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.210
Sweat!?

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.450
Always in a suit

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.590
Even though it's sharp

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.810
!?

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.270
Tork, help me!

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.570
Can I just look at it like this?

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.430
Can I take a video?

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.340
Tork, help me!

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:40.900
picture?

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:08.390
I'm sorry, are you okay?

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:28.760
The finished product

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.600
Shi-sensei today is another stupid son

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.460
Thank you very much.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.580
Luke, you worked hard today too.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.360
Is it true?

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.700
I’m an idiot for skipping school too.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.440
That child of Rino was taught by the teacher.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.200
I run back to work

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.680
Honestly, are you surprised?

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.000
Well, Kishi-sensei is at home.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.500
If you're waiting, it's me from back then.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.780
I ran away and went home.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:04.160
Yes, but yes?

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.800
No, it's nothing.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.320
Thank you for waiting.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:15.140
Well, milk and toys

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.040
Thank you for your letter paper.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.320
Is there such a thing?

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.380
It's probably your milk.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.580
Hey, excuse me for stopping.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:38.860
Please excuse me today.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.420
I also memorized three Chinese words.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.840
That's wonderful, isn't it?

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.220
Let Rukun grow, well.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.420
I wonder if you remember?

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.340
But it's okay, Tolk.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.420
If it is, then understand the meaning properly.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:13:05.400
I understand that, so I guess so.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.560
How about Meka Tolkun?

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.660
It's over, I'll take it.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:23.790
Thank you very much.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.630
The umbrella is crispy

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:29.730
Yeah, if it were me, I'd never do it.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.410
I hate it before me

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:36.610
line or tolkun is self

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:44.500
I'm an arrogant student.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.480
What if I got 100 points?

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.860
Reward, reward

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:50.220
Is it?

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.480
Oh I'll do my best with that

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.150
Okay, I'll think about it.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.110
Look at that!

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:08.850
Well, the will I learned today

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.770
Good luck Tolk

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:21.190
Well, what is Shiga?

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.710
Rakantara is finally here

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:29.410
Those who have ambitions like

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.090
It's finally happening oh yeah that's it

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:35.250
Still, it was a shame.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.230
Rukun ah I don't remember it at all

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:43.730
No way, it's okay I

00:14:43.730 --> 00:15:04.020
It's difficult. It's difficult.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:14.340
Ah, who are you?

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.660
Who is Kuraebi?

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.880
You're a creepy shrimp

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.620
You're better than that

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.940
My brother who has a beautiful moisture in front

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.260
Proper conversation and knowledge

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:28.420
What is teru na sesame pasta?

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:38.980
It's a waste.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:48.940
- Hey, what is this photo?

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.700
That's right, you're fighting.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.080
Kashitoteisacharacha

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:52.780
Don't be lazy

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:53.960
Is he still a Yankee?

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.640
Okay, what's good?

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.500
Yeah, I'm a Yankee

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.480
He's a Yankee in

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.220
So what are you doing with this photo?

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:10.830
Please try to explain

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:20.560
Shikishi this is me

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.640
I am a private tutor for

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.820
What's that, a private tutor?

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.920
You're cheating

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.700
There is a better theory

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.980
That's not a lie

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.340
As a former Yankee

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.940
Well, you're done.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.440
You're real

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.800
The hustle and bustle of being a Yankee

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.160
We'll spend our time fighting

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.700
Dress like you

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.620
Studying with a private tutor

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.500
I don't have time to study.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.700
It's a good study

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:55.720
What's that about you studying?

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.920
study study study

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.720
Which one is yours?

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:12.660
E-learning

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.020
Bunitomaraz

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:20.720
That's all there is to it

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.280
However, I will learn again.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:35.010
What kind of spell is that?

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.950
I don't have time to study

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.210
The idiot who said that has fucking free time.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.670
But I learned nothing

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.770
I told you my family

00:17:46.770 --> 00:18:02.630
Don't make fun of the teacher

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:06.730
When Reiten comes along

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:09.810
Well, the point is, I'll die if I sit down.

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.170
Well, it's like doing it.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.190
This character and this character

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:24.550
It's the other way around, huh?

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:34.940
It's super squishy

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.420
I'm definitely curious.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.860
Those straight eyes

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:50.060
I'm not saying this.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.720
Why did things develop so quickly?

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.080
I can't keep up, but...

00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:00.600
Suki-sukisnanoto

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.840
Uru-kun, fight again.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:10.580
Did you come here? Yes, this is it.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:14.840
Or assaulted once inside

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.320
You did it, Tooru-kun.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:24.460
It's no laughing matter

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.860
What is this first aid kit?

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.640
van four dimensional pocket

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.160
Is it connected to

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.300
Look at me, it hurts a little

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:43.490
Please be patient, Tooru.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.330
why are you fighting today

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:50.190
Why did you do this?

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:56.040
Genuine garden teacher

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.020
It's okay to say that

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.380
I'm going to spend my time in Ka, Tsutomu.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.500
I don't have time to be strong

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:07.050
It's important to me

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:12.240
Please forgive me for making fun of you

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:22.090
Toru-kun who wasn't there is a hundred

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:23.690
100 victories is a good thing

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.730
No matter what, don't fight

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.050
to defeat the enemy's soldiers

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:28.970
is the good of good

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.430
Do you know the Chinese sentence?

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.310
What are those words from Sun Tzu?

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.390
The meaning is all wars

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.670
It's best to win

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:44.950
No, what the fuck is that?

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.050
People who are scared of saying kanbun

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:47.810
Isn't that an excuse?

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.930
No, this is never scary

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.490
This is not the kanji that says

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.410
Text is an opponent without a fight

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:56.590
subjugate the soldiers of

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.010
is the best thing to do

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:01.770
Are you serious?

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.070
How to do it

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.230
Le with me twice a week

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.030
working together

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:12.780
Please be confident

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.900
Tooru-kun, you are fighting

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.960
become stronger than win

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.660
Start walking down the road with me

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.620
I'll win in a fight

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.880
There's nothing like becoming stronger

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.440
Of course

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.730
No, no, no, about studying

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.390
Of course I'm studying

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.990
It's impossible to win

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.810
I'll say it out loud.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:51.410
But I've been looking like this for 3 years

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:55.930
It's like we'll meet again forever

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.590
How did he win by studying?

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:00.830
It's Tsunta, Tooru-kun and me.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.410
Believe and follow me

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.950
Please, yes, I am Tooru-kun.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:06.930
believe in the potential for growth

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.490
I am a proud student.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:22.630
I got it from 100

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:27.370
Reward if you score

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.310
That's what it means.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:39.380
I'm worried, Tooru-kun, yes.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.920
The treatment is completed.Study

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:48.940
Sorry, restarting

00:22:55.300 --> 00:23:00.720
That's why the face is no good, the face

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:08.640
I'm sorry but it's brutal

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.080
The friendship between

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.740
It's all about going against your heart

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.160
not a very close friend

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.640
Even if I liked you

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.440
I can't say it either.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.680
From me, Yankee

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.960
Rumo's direct I love you

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.420
That's the person I love

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.640
What is the beginning of love?

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.640
Uru-kun's wonderful things

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.280
I want to know more about

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.100
Yes, it's a huge hit.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.180
people and things you like

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.460
I know about it myself

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.340
Wouldn't you like to?
