00:01:44.545 --> 00:01:46.145
- What's this?
- A brand.

00:01:47.185 --> 00:01:48.665
Same as the one behind Hanxiao's ear.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:53.865
DU'S MANSION

00:01:54.545 --> 00:01:56.625
Old man, find anything yet?

00:01:56.705 --> 00:01:57.825
What poison is it, exactly?

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:02.425
This is my homemade wine.

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:03.985
Xiao,

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.705
you'll appreciate its delicate nature.

00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:10.505
I named this wine Amber Glow.

00:02:10.584 --> 00:02:12.825
Look. That color.

00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:14.945
Now smell it. That aroma.

00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:16.385
Fine craftsmanship, Mr. Du.

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:21.825
I bought the best grapes
from Persian merchants.

00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:23.985
Only made this one small barrel.

00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:26.105
Come on. First cup from the new jar.

00:02:26.185 --> 00:02:27.425
It's for you to taste.

00:02:27.505 --> 00:02:29.185
- You're not talking, huh?
- Please.

00:02:31.785 --> 00:02:32.825
Put the barrel down.

00:02:32.905 --> 00:02:34.905
- This wine is precious!
- Talk or not?

00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:36.665
Put it down and I'll talk.

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:37.985
- Three…
- I'll talk!

00:02:38.065 --> 00:02:39.665
Okay… I'll talk.

00:02:39.745 --> 00:02:41.145
Bird-poison. Aconite.

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:42.945
Killer's got a lot of hate,

00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:44.385
but not much experience.

00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:47.825
They threw in the most lethal stuff
they could think of.

00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:51.585
There's one more plant.

00:02:52.185 --> 00:02:53.545
But what exactly it is,

00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:55.025
I couldn't tell.

00:02:55.105 --> 00:02:56.425
When can you tell?

00:02:56.505 --> 00:02:57.745
I can't.

00:02:57.825 --> 00:02:59.665
Herbs are like snake venom.

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:00.585
There are thousands.

00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:02.985
Unless the poisoner admits it themselves,

00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:05.825
- otherwise, it's hard to tell.
- Really?

00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:09.145
Really. I already told you.

00:03:09.225 --> 00:03:11.065
Now give me the wine.

00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:12.985
What an old man.

00:03:13.065 --> 00:03:14.065
You get more long-winded with age.

00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:15.705
Bet you're bored at home.

00:03:16.505 --> 00:03:17.945
Bored?

00:03:18.025 --> 00:03:19.905
I've retired.

00:03:19.985 --> 00:03:24.025
The one thing I should do is… rest.

00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:27.265
Come on. Let's drink.

00:03:28.345 --> 00:03:30.825
Someone's been poisoned
and might not be dead yet.

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:32.545
We can't save them.

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:33.825
This poison's vicious.

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:34.905
Even if an immortal shows up,

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:36.985
there's still no way. Come on.

00:03:40.425 --> 00:03:41.465
Just as I thought.

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:42.945
Even the Imperial Medical Office said

00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:45.545
there's no saving them.

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:46.625
Yeah.

00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:47.745
The medical officers checked.

00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:48.705
All said they won't make it.

00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:50.265
What do they know?

00:03:50.345 --> 00:03:51.985
Treating illness, sure.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.825
Detox? That's my job.

00:03:54.665 --> 00:03:58.105
That person's life
can still be held on a bit.

00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:00.465
As long as, before they die,

00:04:00.545 --> 00:04:03.145
we find the last poison,

00:04:03.225 --> 00:04:05.945
get the antidote, and add my prescription.

00:04:08.785 --> 00:04:10.825
Old man, that's you alright!

00:04:10.905 --> 00:04:12.385
Inspector Du,
you're well-read and worldly.

00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:15.665
This is nothing yet.

00:04:15.745 --> 00:04:16.905
Just wait.

00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:19.105
I'll get you two something good!

00:04:27.985 --> 00:04:30.425
The artist drew these sketches
based on their bone structures.

00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:32.065
Their bodies were badly swollen.

00:04:32.145 --> 00:04:33.345
So it's only an approximation.

00:04:33.425 --> 00:04:34.825
Except for Birou,

00:04:35.345 --> 00:04:36.545
the other six girls are all here.

00:04:36.625 --> 00:04:39.345
These days, Mr. Gu
has visited their hometowns.

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:40.905
No one's seen them return.

00:04:41.545 --> 00:04:43.025
Besides these six girls,

00:04:43.545 --> 00:04:44.585
those who got killed

00:04:44.665 --> 00:04:46.705
were mostly former clients
of Xiuhong House.

00:04:47.305 --> 00:04:49.185
Why would the killer
want to wipe them all out?

00:04:50.505 --> 00:04:51.625
Mr. Xiao,

00:04:51.705 --> 00:04:53.745
you said you'd seen Birou before. Where?

00:05:00.985 --> 00:05:02.425
How long have you been back here?

00:05:04.025 --> 00:05:04.945
I just got back.

00:05:05.545 --> 00:05:06.705
Or did you never leave at all?

00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:12.065
Your Ladyship,
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

00:05:12.705 --> 00:05:13.865
I'm sick like this.

00:05:13.945 --> 00:05:16.705
Even if I went back home,
I couldn't make a living.

00:05:17.225 --> 00:05:19.585
So… I stayed here instead.

00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:31.705
What do you do for a living?

00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:37.025
Smells so good.

00:05:37.105 --> 00:05:39.625
I blend essential oils and hair oil.

00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:42.305
They nourish the hair
and help condition the body too.

00:05:42.905 --> 00:05:45.345
If Your Ladyship likes it,
take a few jars back with you.

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:47.545
If you don't like it too strong,

00:05:47.625 --> 00:05:49.505
I can make a lighter scent as well.

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:52.585
Stop picking at it.

00:05:52.665 --> 00:05:53.505
You're making it bleed.

00:05:55.185 --> 00:05:56.505
I'll be fine with some honey balm.

00:05:56.585 --> 00:05:58.625
Are you still in touch
with Ruyi and the others?

00:06:00.305 --> 00:06:02.505
I wasn't that close with them.

00:06:02.585 --> 00:06:04.865
And I didn't leave
Western Capital with them.

00:06:07.705 --> 00:06:08.985
Did something happen to them?

00:06:10.385 --> 00:06:12.745
If you hear anything about them,
please tell me.

00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:17.625
ZHUQUE GATE

00:06:17.705 --> 00:06:18.785
Wuren.

00:06:23.265 --> 00:06:24.105
Mr. Gu.

00:06:24.705 --> 00:06:26.705
Are you looking for an official
who's been on leave?

00:06:27.305 --> 00:06:28.305
You have a lead on him?

00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:30.225
I know someone.

00:06:30.305 --> 00:06:32.625
The day after Prince of Heng died,
he suddenly took leave

00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:34.145
and said he had to rush home.

00:06:34.225 --> 00:06:35.345
But these past few days,

00:06:35.425 --> 00:06:37.745
he summoned
all the famous physicians to his house.

00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:41.385
Though… Maybe I'm overthinking it.

00:06:42.225 --> 00:06:43.465
Who is it?

00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:48.425
Chief Justice, Wu Yuekun.

00:06:49.305 --> 00:06:54.265
WU'S MANSION

00:06:55.945 --> 00:06:57.825
Sirs, my master has gone out.

00:06:57.905 --> 00:06:59.305
Waiting here is pointless.

00:07:01.305 --> 00:07:02.665
Tell your lady

00:07:03.185 --> 00:07:05.985
your master's poison
can only be cured by me.

00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:23.745
What medicines have you used?

00:07:30.185 --> 00:07:32.665
We found the best physicians
in Western Capital.

00:07:32.745 --> 00:07:34.065
They prescribed antidotes.

00:07:34.665 --> 00:07:36.545
But they said the poison is strange.
It can't be fully neutralized.

00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:38.505
It's only barely keeping him alive.

00:07:38.585 --> 00:07:41.985
We don't even know
how long he can hold on.

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:48.585
Your Ladyship,

00:07:49.545 --> 00:07:52.065
can my husband still be saved?

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:54.785
Catch the killer sooner,

00:07:54.865 --> 00:07:56.545
and we save him sooner.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.545
It depends on whether you cooperate.

00:08:00.705 --> 00:08:02.265
I'm just a woman.

00:08:02.345 --> 00:08:03.625
How am I supposed to catch a killer?

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:05.905
Just answer our questions.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.145
Five days ago,

00:08:07.225 --> 00:08:09.705
did Wu Yuekun go
to Vice Minister Yang's home?

00:08:09.785 --> 00:08:11.065
Was he poisoned the same night?

00:08:16.865 --> 00:08:18.465
Do you have anyone else to rely on?

00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:23.825
If Wu Yuekun truly dies,

00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:26.145
how will you live from then on?

00:08:34.705 --> 00:08:36.585
Why should I believe

00:08:36.664 --> 00:08:38.345
you can save my husband?

00:08:40.185 --> 00:08:42.465
You're desperate and grasping at straws.

00:08:42.545 --> 00:08:45.185
If not us, who else can you trust?

00:08:54.105 --> 00:08:55.505
If I say the wrong thing,

00:08:56.545 --> 00:08:58.665
he'll beat me to death!

00:09:04.145 --> 00:09:07.185
Fine. When he dies,
no one will hit you again.

00:09:09.585 --> 00:09:10.625
I'll talk.

00:09:10.705 --> 00:09:12.025
I'll talk.

00:09:15.265 --> 00:09:16.385
Five days ago,

00:09:16.465 --> 00:09:18.505
my husband went out to entertain guests.

00:09:18.585 --> 00:09:20.425
He came back early, all of a sudden.

00:09:21.025 --> 00:09:22.985
Then he kept coughing blood.

00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:25.185
He warned me

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:27.025
not to let anyone know.

00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:29.745
Then he passed out.

00:09:30.665 --> 00:09:32.185
Our driver was afraid

00:09:32.265 --> 00:09:34.065
he'd be dragged into a murder case.

00:09:34.145 --> 00:09:38.985
He told me my husband
had gone to Vice Minister Yang's house.

00:09:39.065 --> 00:09:41.985
After that, he resigned
and wouldn't stay a single extra day.

00:09:43.065 --> 00:09:44.945
He must've stepped in something big.

00:09:45.865 --> 00:09:46.705
But…

00:09:48.025 --> 00:09:50.145
I'm just a woman.

00:09:50.225 --> 00:09:52.025
What could I do?

00:09:53.265 --> 00:09:55.505
That's all I know. Your Ladyship…

00:09:57.865 --> 00:09:58.705
Your Ladyship!

00:09:59.305 --> 00:10:01.145
Please save my husband!

00:10:39.025 --> 00:10:40.985
Go tell the physicians you hired

00:10:41.065 --> 00:10:42.305
there's no Gelsemium in this poison.

00:10:42.905 --> 00:10:46.065
It's aconite. Your prescription is off.

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:47.545
He'd be better off
just drinking warm water.

00:10:47.625 --> 00:10:48.665
Alright.

00:10:49.705 --> 00:10:50.785
I'll go now.

00:11:00.825 --> 00:11:01.745
Stop staring.

00:11:02.425 --> 00:11:04.225
You should thank your lady.

00:11:04.305 --> 00:11:05.265
She just saved your life.

00:11:05.905 --> 00:11:07.785
That pill I gave you just now

00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:09.825
will buy you four hours at most.

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:12.665
Tell the truth
and help us catch the killer fast,

00:11:12.745 --> 00:11:15.185
or keep stalling and die for it.

00:11:15.265 --> 00:11:16.145
You choose.

00:11:17.585 --> 00:11:20.065
The real owner of Xiuhong House
is you, isn't it?

00:11:22.345 --> 00:11:24.865
You pretended to let Prosecutor Cheng
investigate closely,

00:11:24.945 --> 00:11:26.865
so you could track every step of the case

00:11:26.945 --> 00:11:28.225
and line up scapegoats in advance.

00:11:28.305 --> 00:11:29.625
You played it safe at every turn.

00:11:29.705 --> 00:11:31.225
You finally got away clean.

00:11:31.305 --> 00:11:32.785
So why risk it now?

00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:37.905
Are you that stupid,
or do you think we are?

00:11:45.265 --> 00:11:47.785
Xiao Huaijin…

00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:51.665
You're so young,

00:11:51.745 --> 00:11:54.585
yet just like your father,
always lecturing.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.945
Say whatever you want.

00:11:58.025 --> 00:12:00.065
Spin it however you like.

00:12:01.465 --> 00:12:05.465
I was only poisoned by accident

00:12:05.545 --> 00:12:08.465
in my own house.

00:12:08.545 --> 00:12:10.225
As for the rest,

00:12:10.985 --> 00:12:12.585
I know nothing.

00:12:18.105 --> 00:12:19.865
You schemed it this long,

00:12:20.585 --> 00:12:22.345
and all you've got is deny?

00:12:23.025 --> 00:12:25.025
Just like Lu Zhenglian.

00:12:25.665 --> 00:12:28.505
So you deny going
to Vice Minister Yang's house

00:12:28.585 --> 00:12:30.705
and having anything
to do with those girls?

00:12:31.905 --> 00:12:34.665
I've kept my name clean my whole life.

00:12:34.745 --> 00:12:37.185
Don't you slander me!

00:12:45.345 --> 00:12:46.185
Fine.

00:12:47.545 --> 00:12:49.625
Since you want to play the good official,

00:12:50.545 --> 00:12:52.025
I'll tell you a story.

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:53.785
Deputy Director Xiao,

00:12:54.345 --> 00:12:56.785
what story could possibly
suit the Chief Justice?

00:13:00.065 --> 00:13:01.465
Of course,

00:13:01.545 --> 00:13:04.105
the story of hating evil
and upholding justice

00:13:04.185 --> 00:13:05.905
at all cost.

00:13:07.185 --> 00:13:08.225
Go on, please.

00:13:08.905 --> 00:13:09.945
In the Xiuhong House case,

00:13:10.025 --> 00:13:12.465
though Sun Zhiwang
and Lu Zhenglian have met justice,

00:13:12.545 --> 00:13:13.705
everyone knows

00:13:13.785 --> 00:13:16.105
the real masterminds,
those nobles who abused palace maids,

00:13:16.705 --> 00:13:18.225
are still at large.

00:13:18.905 --> 00:13:20.465
Chief Justice Wu Yuekun

00:13:20.545 --> 00:13:22.105
was heartsick to see the law trampled,

00:13:22.185 --> 00:13:24.745
his men set up, and even more heartsick

00:13:24.825 --> 00:13:26.025
that justice couldn't be served.

00:13:26.785 --> 00:13:27.745
But he also knew

00:13:27.825 --> 00:13:29.265
all witnesses and evidence were gone.

00:13:29.345 --> 00:13:33.105
By normal means,
he could never get true justice.

00:13:33.185 --> 00:13:34.305
So,

00:13:34.945 --> 00:13:36.505
he chose the dangerous path

00:13:37.105 --> 00:13:40.625
to make them pay in his own way.

00:13:41.825 --> 00:13:43.545
But how would he make them pay?

00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:45.865
After hearing Lou Chuo's confession,

00:13:45.945 --> 00:13:48.305
he tracked down Prince of Heng,
the one with scars on his inner wrist.

00:13:48.385 --> 00:13:50.185
He pretended to win Prince of Heng's trust

00:13:50.265 --> 00:13:52.305
and little by little,
dug up that whole group's secrets.

00:13:52.385 --> 00:13:53.385
Five days ago,

00:13:53.985 --> 00:13:56.105
he and Prince of Heng met in secret
at Vice Minister Yang's home.

00:13:56.185 --> 00:13:58.105
He used the chance
to scatter homemade poison

00:13:58.185 --> 00:13:59.545
into the pond.

00:14:01.345 --> 00:14:02.905
To avoid suspicion,

00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:05.225
he'd rather enter
the poisoned pond himself

00:14:05.305 --> 00:14:06.945
and go down with them.

00:14:07.025 --> 00:14:08.865
Thankfully, Heaven was watching.

00:14:08.945 --> 00:14:12.145
He took the antidote in time
and kept his life.

00:14:17.345 --> 00:14:19.225
What a heroic and epic story,

00:14:19.305 --> 00:14:20.665
a touching one.

00:14:21.185 --> 00:14:23.065
His Majesty will surely show mercy

00:14:23.145 --> 00:14:25.305
and praise your noble heart,

00:14:25.385 --> 00:14:27.305
even if

00:14:27.385 --> 00:14:30.905
- you poisoned His Majesty's own son.
- You…

00:14:30.985 --> 00:14:33.905
You think I've got no proof,
just making things up?

00:14:33.985 --> 00:14:35.185
You…

00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:37.145
Of course I have proof.

00:14:48.625 --> 00:14:50.345
Your personal token,

00:14:51.025 --> 00:14:52.305
an imperial gift.

00:14:53.105 --> 00:14:54.625
What are you doing?

00:14:54.705 --> 00:14:57.265
What are you doing?

00:15:00.505 --> 00:15:02.105
Looking for evidence, of course.

00:15:03.185 --> 00:15:06.305
After I drained the poison water
from Vice Minister Yang's pond,

00:15:06.385 --> 00:15:08.345
I found this at the bottom.

00:15:14.185 --> 00:15:17.105
This bottle of poison
was mixed just for you.

00:15:17.185 --> 00:15:19.265
It's almost like what was in the pond.

00:15:19.345 --> 00:15:22.625
Once it's diluted in water,
it's a perfect match.

00:15:23.345 --> 00:15:26.225
Little vials like this,
I hid five or six in your residence.

00:15:27.785 --> 00:15:28.825
Don't rush.

00:15:28.905 --> 00:15:30.625
When the Palace Investigation Bureau
searches your home,

00:15:31.225 --> 00:15:32.385
you'll see where I hid them.

00:15:35.425 --> 00:15:36.785
What we lack now is a witness.

00:15:37.505 --> 00:15:39.225
Your lady won't admit it, of course.

00:15:39.865 --> 00:15:41.465
And your driver has long fled.

00:15:41.545 --> 00:15:42.825
But that's fine.

00:15:43.465 --> 00:15:44.665
The gatekeeper
at Vice Minister Yang's house

00:15:44.745 --> 00:15:45.585
saw you that night.

00:15:45.665 --> 00:15:46.625
He can testify.

00:15:46.705 --> 00:15:49.625
He's lying. He's lying!

00:15:49.705 --> 00:15:51.105
Yeah, he is lying.

00:15:51.185 --> 00:15:54.625
But this remains a secret
known only to us.

00:15:59.345 --> 00:16:01.505
You're best at erasing evidence.

00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:04.305
Then let me show you
the art of fabricating it.

00:16:04.825 --> 00:16:07.665
You can lie through your teeth,
and I can twist the truth too.

00:16:08.265 --> 00:16:09.945
Thanks to you, you "elders,"

00:16:10.025 --> 00:16:12.425
I've learned quite a few
new ways to crack a case.

00:16:12.945 --> 00:16:14.465
Since you like to play,

00:16:15.065 --> 00:16:16.225
I'll play to the end.

00:16:17.225 --> 00:16:20.505
I'd rather die than let you have your way!

00:16:27.745 --> 00:16:29.665
You'd better keep your word.

00:16:29.745 --> 00:16:31.705
But don't think dying ends this.

00:16:31.785 --> 00:16:33.225
If you dare kill yourself,

00:16:33.305 --> 00:16:35.385
I'll make this story stick anyway

00:16:35.465 --> 00:16:36.745
and wipe out your whole clan,

00:16:36.825 --> 00:16:38.705
no heirs left.

00:16:42.545 --> 00:16:45.745
I have no parents. A cursed lone star.

00:16:45.825 --> 00:16:47.305
I don't fear living,
and I sure don't fear dying.

00:17:01.665 --> 00:17:03.105
But Wu Yuekun…

00:17:04.305 --> 00:17:05.305
do you fear?

00:17:21.025 --> 00:17:23.345
It's all those girls' fault!

00:17:24.025 --> 00:17:26.625
I was ready to quit for good.

00:17:27.665 --> 00:17:30.105
But they came begging me,

00:17:30.945 --> 00:17:33.065
saying once they left Xiuhong House,

00:17:33.145 --> 00:17:34.865
they had no way to live.

00:17:34.945 --> 00:17:36.865
They asked me to help them.

00:17:37.865 --> 00:17:41.425
They even hatched the plan themselves.

00:17:42.505 --> 00:17:45.865
To go to the ministers' mansions.

00:17:45.945 --> 00:17:48.385
Safer and more fun that way.

00:17:48.465 --> 00:17:50.665
I went soft

00:17:50.745 --> 00:17:52.705
and agreed.

00:17:53.985 --> 00:17:55.905
They got me killed.

00:17:55.985 --> 00:17:58.265
They got me killed!

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:02.465
You're beyond saving.

00:18:04.265 --> 00:18:05.545
If you want to save
your wife and children,

00:18:06.265 --> 00:18:09.185
write your crimes down, every last one.

00:18:09.265 --> 00:18:10.705
In two hours,

00:18:11.345 --> 00:18:13.945
whether you walk back to the living
or walk towards the underworld

00:18:14.025 --> 00:18:14.865
is up to you.

00:18:40.985 --> 00:18:43.585
This is where Wu Yuekun kept those girls.

00:18:44.265 --> 00:18:45.745
This room's too neat.

00:18:45.825 --> 00:18:47.025
Doesn't look like anyone lived here.

00:18:49.105 --> 00:18:51.385
Would women use the exact same balm?

00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:52.985
Especially women living together.

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:54.265
Usually not.

00:18:54.865 --> 00:18:56.625
Especially those who live by their looks.

00:18:56.705 --> 00:18:59.825
They need something
clients will remember at once.

00:19:05.425 --> 00:19:07.825
Sun, moon, and stars are alike in form,
jewel-like in glow.

00:19:07.905 --> 00:19:08.905
Sustained by essence,

00:19:08.985 --> 00:19:11.105
each keeps its role
and shines its radiance.

00:19:11.185 --> 00:19:12.505
Though stars are all spheres,

00:19:12.585 --> 00:19:14.025
their sizes, colors,

00:19:14.105 --> 00:19:15.745
and speeds all differ.

00:19:15.825 --> 00:19:17.025
People are no different,

00:19:17.105 --> 00:19:19.065
each with their own tastes and habits.

00:19:19.145 --> 00:19:22.185
And those habits leave traces

00:19:22.265 --> 00:19:24.665
in what they use and where they live.

00:19:28.425 --> 00:19:31.905
But all six arranged
their space identically,

00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:34.385
even using the same items.

00:19:34.465 --> 00:19:37.785
And there's nothing here
that matches who they were.

00:19:38.865 --> 00:19:40.265
In this room,

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:43.385
I can't read any clues, any preferences.

00:19:43.985 --> 00:19:46.105
Women should at least have
some personal items.

00:19:46.625 --> 00:19:47.465
A handkerchief,

00:19:47.545 --> 00:19:48.825
a sachet,

00:19:48.905 --> 00:19:50.825
or jewelry with their name on it.

00:19:51.785 --> 00:19:53.025
None here.

00:19:53.105 --> 00:19:54.825
Not on their bodies either.

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:56.985
Two possibilities.

00:19:57.505 --> 00:19:59.865
First, someone cleaned this place.

00:20:00.385 --> 00:20:01.225
Second,

00:20:02.465 --> 00:20:03.625
they knew they were going to die.

00:20:33.505 --> 00:20:34.785
Where is Vice Minister Yang's body?

00:20:34.865 --> 00:20:35.865
Over there.

00:20:54.705 --> 00:20:56.785
So that's how the poison was brought in.

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:19.425
{\an8}DISCIPLINE AND PRUDENCE

00:21:19.505 --> 00:21:20.345
Come on.

00:21:21.665 --> 00:21:23.785
- Have a sip.
- Much obliged.

00:21:28.785 --> 00:21:31.185
- Well?
- That's fine wine.

00:21:34.025 --> 00:21:35.505
Xiao,

00:21:35.585 --> 00:21:37.185
come by often.

00:21:37.265 --> 00:21:39.625
If you get my wine, you get me.

00:21:41.825 --> 00:21:45.225
That wild girl…
She finally let you rest today?

00:21:45.825 --> 00:21:47.785
She was going
to the Court of Judicial Review,

00:21:47.865 --> 00:21:48.705
so she told me to wait here.

00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:53.185
She… She's coming here again?

00:21:54.265 --> 00:21:55.705
Old man!

00:21:55.785 --> 00:21:56.985
Save me!

00:22:02.145 --> 00:22:03.145
What happened?

00:22:03.225 --> 00:22:05.505
How is it? Same as the poison
Prince of Heng took?

00:22:07.625 --> 00:22:08.705
Same.

00:22:11.745 --> 00:22:13.985
You poisoned yourself on purpose
just to trick me into tasting it?

00:22:14.705 --> 00:22:16.545
Just a sip. It won't kill you.

00:22:17.425 --> 00:22:20.105
Besides, with your miracle antidote,

00:22:20.185 --> 00:22:21.265
we're safe.

00:22:27.785 --> 00:22:29.265
You found how they poisoned them?

00:22:30.505 --> 00:22:31.345
I did.

00:22:32.025 --> 00:22:33.065
But we still need one person.

00:22:33.745 --> 00:22:35.185
The one who supplied them the poison.

00:22:37.945 --> 00:22:38.985
Did anyone go in?

00:22:39.065 --> 00:22:40.905
No. Only one servant
delivered the medicine,

00:22:40.985 --> 00:22:42.305
and I carried it in.

00:22:51.825 --> 00:22:52.745
No way.

00:22:53.345 --> 00:22:55.545
That servant
took a sip right in front of me.

00:23:10.905 --> 00:23:14.705
Beeswax. Clove. Sweet reseda.

00:23:17.905 --> 00:23:19.105
That person never planned to live.

00:23:20.785 --> 00:23:21.785
That person…

00:23:22.385 --> 00:23:23.905
You will have to see them yourself.

00:23:41.745 --> 00:23:43.705
Have I caused you trouble again?

00:23:46.025 --> 00:23:47.185
For people like that,

00:23:48.025 --> 00:23:50.585
to throw away your life, is it worth it?

00:23:53.385 --> 00:23:55.505
For people like us,

00:23:55.585 --> 00:23:58.465
dying is easier than living.

00:23:59.465 --> 00:24:00.745
If we die

00:24:00.825 --> 00:24:03.265
and drag those beasts down with us,

00:24:05.025 --> 00:24:06.225
then it's not a bad trade.

00:24:09.465 --> 00:24:10.345
Your Ladyship, please sit.

00:24:21.025 --> 00:24:22.785
That day, after Mr. Xiao

00:24:22.865 --> 00:24:24.825
sent us away from Western Capital,

00:24:25.825 --> 00:24:27.985
I fought with Ruyi in the carriage.

00:24:28.705 --> 00:24:31.105
Back then, if she hadn't
gone back on her word,

00:24:31.185 --> 00:24:33.225
she clearly remembered that client's face,

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:34.665
then suddenly changed her story,

00:24:35.465 --> 00:24:38.025
you would've caught all those monsters.

00:24:39.185 --> 00:24:40.985
You wouldn't have
been framed and jailed either.

00:24:41.585 --> 00:24:43.585
You did so much for us,

00:24:43.665 --> 00:24:45.025
and it all went to waste.

00:24:46.105 --> 00:24:47.105
Hanxiao,

00:24:48.225 --> 00:24:49.065
Taozhi.

00:24:50.265 --> 00:24:51.545
They died for nothing too.

00:24:53.945 --> 00:24:56.945
I was furious.
I didn't want to travel with them,

00:24:57.025 --> 00:24:58.425
so I got off the carriage.

00:25:03.705 --> 00:25:06.185
That day, I didn't have a single coin.

00:25:09.625 --> 00:25:10.865
To get my purse back,

00:25:12.025 --> 00:25:13.625
I ran after the carriage.

00:25:15.105 --> 00:25:16.265
But I never thought

00:25:17.305 --> 00:25:18.745
I'd actually catch up.

00:25:21.345 --> 00:25:22.545
What happened?

00:25:24.345 --> 00:25:26.225
Ruyi? Cuizhu?

00:25:27.745 --> 00:25:28.745
Where are you?

00:25:32.305 --> 00:25:33.265
Sir,

00:25:33.785 --> 00:25:35.625
what happened? Where are they?

00:25:37.545 --> 00:25:38.785
Wu Yue…

00:25:38.865 --> 00:25:40.065
Say it.

00:25:40.145 --> 00:25:40.985
…Kun!

00:25:43.665 --> 00:25:45.345
With every last ounce of strength,

00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:48.465
that man said one name.

00:25:51.505 --> 00:25:52.345
Wu Yuekun.

00:25:53.425 --> 00:25:54.545
I don't know if Ruyi and the others

00:25:55.145 --> 00:25:56.625
are dead or alive.

00:25:58.905 --> 00:26:00.985
Not until I reached
the Court of Judicial Review gate

00:26:01.065 --> 00:26:02.385
did I see his face.

00:26:02.985 --> 00:26:04.545
Even without a mask,

00:26:04.625 --> 00:26:05.985
I'd still recognize him.

00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:08.345
He's the real owner of Xiuhong House.

00:26:08.425 --> 00:26:10.065
I saw him there.

00:26:10.865 --> 00:26:13.225
Before the banquet began that day,

00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:15.345
Zhenniang had us change clothes.

00:26:16.345 --> 00:26:18.025
Then, like we were merchandise,

00:26:18.825 --> 00:26:20.545
she presented us to him.

00:26:21.145 --> 00:26:24.225
His eyes were like a hawk's.

00:26:25.465 --> 00:26:26.905
Even through the mask,

00:26:27.665 --> 00:26:28.985
he sized us up.

00:26:31.265 --> 00:26:33.385
And with his own hands,

00:26:34.145 --> 00:26:35.785
he pushed us into an endless nightmare.

00:26:40.345 --> 00:26:42.625
Yet he didn't even remember who I was.

00:26:43.665 --> 00:26:46.785
He even asked what grievance I had.

00:26:48.665 --> 00:26:50.985
That's when I finally understood

00:26:51.065 --> 00:26:53.065
why Ruyi kept changing her words.

00:26:54.145 --> 00:26:56.625
And I understood why you and Mr. Xiao

00:26:57.505 --> 00:26:59.985
couldn't save her,
no matter how hard you tried.

00:27:01.985 --> 00:27:05.185
Because the one investigating the case
was the mastermind.

00:27:06.465 --> 00:27:07.865
So you decided to take revenge.

00:27:10.025 --> 00:27:12.105
But at the time, I didn't know how.

00:27:15.025 --> 00:27:17.185
I feared Ruyi and the others
were already dead,

00:27:18.745 --> 00:27:20.545
but I prayed they were still alive.

00:27:22.105 --> 00:27:23.425
So…

00:27:24.785 --> 00:27:27.425
every day, I followed Wu Yuekun.

00:27:27.505 --> 00:27:29.065
I wanted to find them,

00:27:30.465 --> 00:27:31.945
but he was cautious.

00:27:32.505 --> 00:27:34.585
That house gate was always guarded.

00:27:35.225 --> 00:27:38.025
Later, I don't know what Ruyi did,

00:27:38.105 --> 00:27:39.705
but she earned Wu Yuekun's trust.

00:27:41.745 --> 00:27:44.305
He even let her go out

00:27:44.385 --> 00:27:46.065
to buy makeup and powder.

00:27:47.905 --> 00:27:50.345
I seized the chance to meet her.

00:27:59.025 --> 00:28:00.185
Why are you here?

00:28:00.265 --> 00:28:01.825
Why are you here too?

00:28:04.785 --> 00:28:06.705
Western Capital isn't a place for you.

00:28:07.425 --> 00:28:09.265
- Leave, now.
- Come with me.

00:28:12.065 --> 00:28:13.545
I know a back road.

00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:14.545
Within two hours,

00:28:14.625 --> 00:28:16.865
I can get you on a southbound boat.

00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:18.065
As for the other girls,

00:28:18.145 --> 00:28:19.465
I'll find a way to save them.

00:28:19.985 --> 00:28:21.505
I won't let him drag you back again.

00:28:23.785 --> 00:28:25.225
He didn't take them.

00:28:26.425 --> 00:28:27.745
I brought them back.

00:28:29.105 --> 00:28:31.945
- You…
- Since he won't let us go,

00:28:32.585 --> 00:28:33.705
then…

00:28:34.305 --> 00:28:35.665
I won't let him go either.

00:28:38.905 --> 00:28:40.145
With this token,

00:28:40.745 --> 00:28:42.105
at the next relay station,

00:28:42.185 --> 00:28:45.865
they'll send men
to escort you the rest of the way.

00:28:52.145 --> 00:28:53.825
I'm going to kill Wu Yuekun

00:28:54.945 --> 00:28:56.465
and avenge everyone.

00:28:57.905 --> 00:28:59.265
We'll kill him together.

00:29:01.465 --> 00:29:02.865
Do you really want to kill him?

00:29:03.625 --> 00:29:05.225
Not just him.

00:29:07.025 --> 00:29:08.785
I want to kill myself too.

00:29:11.825 --> 00:29:13.745
I thought leaving Xiuhong House

00:29:15.145 --> 00:29:16.545
would end the nightmare.

00:29:16.625 --> 00:29:19.425
But… ever since that day,

00:29:21.505 --> 00:29:24.105
not one night have I slept in peace.

00:29:24.945 --> 00:29:26.745
The moment I think

00:29:26.825 --> 00:29:28.585
of those men with their blades,

00:29:28.665 --> 00:29:29.985
cutting into us

00:29:30.065 --> 00:29:32.025
one slice after another,

00:29:32.625 --> 00:29:35.345
still able to live at ease,
safe and sound,

00:29:36.385 --> 00:29:39.145
I… I don't even dare to die.

00:29:39.745 --> 00:29:41.225
I'm so scared.

00:29:42.505 --> 00:29:44.145
I'm scared that if I die,

00:29:44.225 --> 00:29:47.585
no one will ever know what they did.

00:29:51.665 --> 00:29:52.945
Ruyi told me

00:29:53.465 --> 00:29:55.425
that to stay alive,

00:29:56.105 --> 00:29:57.585
they pretended

00:29:57.665 --> 00:30:00.665
they wanted to stick with Wu Yuekun
and make a living.

00:30:01.265 --> 00:30:03.945
They even came up with a plan
he couldn't refuse.

00:30:04.625 --> 00:30:07.545
They'd build him a "moving" Xiuhong House.

00:30:08.705 --> 00:30:10.265
Wu Yuekun was wary and suspicious.

00:30:11.105 --> 00:30:14.225
No matter how perfect the plan was,
he wouldn't agree easily.

00:30:16.745 --> 00:30:18.945
To win Wu Yuekun's trust,

00:30:19.545 --> 00:30:20.945
Ruyi did a lot of talking.

00:30:22.425 --> 00:30:23.825
She even told him,

00:30:25.185 --> 00:30:27.745
if not for Hanxiao and Taozhi

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:29.305
making such a big fuss,

00:30:29.945 --> 00:30:31.825
she never would've wanted
to leave Xiuhong House.

00:30:33.945 --> 00:30:35.425
Ruyi also discovered

00:30:36.225 --> 00:30:37.705
that though Wu Yuekun was cautious,

00:30:38.305 --> 00:30:41.545
his superiors seemed to be pressuring him
to reopen Xiuhong House.

00:30:41.625 --> 00:30:43.905
So she played to his tastes

00:30:44.665 --> 00:30:46.585
and proposed a traveling pleasure den.

00:30:48.265 --> 00:30:51.145
Only then did Wu Yuekun say
he'd keep working with them.

00:30:51.865 --> 00:30:55.025
But targeting noble households
wasn't easy.

00:30:56.785 --> 00:31:00.425
Every time they entered,
they were searched top to bottom.

00:31:01.425 --> 00:31:03.665
And for a long time,
they couldn't find a chance to act.

00:31:06.425 --> 00:31:08.105
Until I came up with a way.

00:32:10.065 --> 00:32:11.385
You must've

00:32:12.065 --> 00:32:13.625
pieced together the rest.

00:32:16.465 --> 00:32:18.185
I thought my vengeance was done

00:32:19.065 --> 00:32:21.185
and wanted to follow them in death.

00:32:22.905 --> 00:32:25.385
But I found Wu Yuekun wasn't dead.

00:32:29.265 --> 00:32:30.865
I couldn't understand

00:32:32.625 --> 00:32:34.665
why that day, I was the only lucky one

00:32:34.745 --> 00:32:37.145
jumping off the carriage and escaping it.

00:32:37.745 --> 00:32:39.025
Not until that moment

00:32:39.785 --> 00:32:42.785
did I understand Heaven had its plan.

00:32:44.145 --> 00:32:47.105
It was so that when that beast Wu Yuekun

00:32:47.185 --> 00:32:48.905
was barely clinging to life,

00:32:50.065 --> 00:32:52.425
I could hand him one more bowl of poison.

00:33:05.545 --> 00:33:07.025
- This place is so beautiful.
- Careful!

00:33:09.625 --> 00:33:11.185
- That's so fun!
- Come!

00:33:11.265 --> 00:33:12.265
Look!

00:33:16.545 --> 00:33:17.465
It's warmed up.

00:33:19.505 --> 00:33:22.625
The flowers back home are about to bloom.

00:33:33.305 --> 00:33:35.785
Your Ladyship, do you know?

00:33:36.785 --> 00:33:38.945
That Hundred Charms flower
on the palace wall

00:33:39.665 --> 00:33:41.145
has another name.

00:33:44.825 --> 00:33:45.905
It's called Hanxiao.

00:34:05.225 --> 00:34:06.065
Madam,

00:34:07.065 --> 00:34:08.784
is this where palace maids are buried?

00:34:09.465 --> 00:34:10.905
Your elder sister
was a former palace maid.

00:34:10.985 --> 00:34:12.145
She shouldn't have been buried here.

00:34:12.225 --> 00:34:15.065
But His Majesty showed mercy
and granted her a resting place.

00:34:20.105 --> 00:34:23.065
TOMB OF LOU CHUO, TOMB OF HANXIAO

00:34:23.905 --> 00:34:25.505
This tomb is huge.

00:34:26.545 --> 00:34:27.905
Who's buried inside?

00:34:28.665 --> 00:34:30.665
Your sister's close friends in the palace

00:34:31.585 --> 00:34:34.945
and the seven bravest women
in all of Western Capital.

00:34:36.865 --> 00:34:39.625
TOMB OF THE SEVEN PALACE MAIDS

00:34:49.784 --> 00:34:52.264
TOMB OF HANXIAO

00:34:52.344 --> 00:34:53.465
Hanxiao…

00:34:57.105 --> 00:34:57.945
I folded these

00:34:58.505 --> 00:35:00.145
for you myself.

00:35:01.625 --> 00:35:03.105
Down there,

00:35:05.425 --> 00:35:06.785
use them freely.

00:35:18.305 --> 00:35:19.305
His Majesty has issued an edict

00:35:19.385 --> 00:35:21.505
to reform the palace maids' discharge.

00:35:21.585 --> 00:35:24.825
Maids who leave the palace
will be settled more properly.

00:35:25.425 --> 00:35:28.585
The families of the slain maids
will receive compensation.

00:35:29.265 --> 00:35:31.545
{\an8}Prince of Heng's title has been stripped.

00:35:31.625 --> 00:35:33.025
{\an8}As for Wu Yuekun, Vice Minister Yang…

00:35:33.105 --> 00:35:36.665
Their families have all been exiled.
Mr. Gu has been reinstated.

00:35:38.025 --> 00:35:39.905
All of this cost nine lives.

00:35:41.225 --> 00:35:42.625
I solved the case,

00:35:43.825 --> 00:35:45.465
but I didn't save anything.

00:35:51.385 --> 00:35:55.585
TO THE LATE SISTER GU TAOZHI

00:36:24.425 --> 00:36:25.705
It's all over.

00:36:26.345 --> 00:36:29.545
My sister will be grateful
to you all from heaven.

00:36:32.105 --> 00:36:34.545
Before she passed,
Birou asked me to bring you this.

00:36:39.825 --> 00:36:40.985
Birou told me,

00:36:41.585 --> 00:36:43.745
that day, Taozhi heard
they were going out to work,

00:36:44.265 --> 00:36:45.825
but they couldn't say what job

00:36:45.905 --> 00:36:47.145
or where they were going.

00:36:47.225 --> 00:36:48.505
She couldn't rest easy.

00:36:48.585 --> 00:36:51.425
She didn't even have time to tell you
and got on the carriage with them.

00:36:52.425 --> 00:36:54.985
Birou always felt she got Taozhi killed.

00:36:55.585 --> 00:36:57.425
She wanted to apologize to you in person,

00:36:57.505 --> 00:36:59.265
but she never had the courage.

00:37:01.825 --> 00:37:02.945
Taozhi was always like that,

00:37:03.745 --> 00:37:05.825
upright, warm-hearted.

00:37:06.825 --> 00:37:08.185
That's my sister.

00:37:10.465 --> 00:37:12.945
It's only our fault we got there too late.

00:37:13.665 --> 00:37:14.985
Don't say that.

00:37:15.585 --> 00:37:16.905
If not for you giving it your all,

00:37:16.985 --> 00:37:19.065
there might've been more girls harmed.

00:37:19.985 --> 00:37:21.305
Even if she'd known the ending,

00:37:22.225 --> 00:37:23.145
that day,

00:37:23.705 --> 00:37:25.545
she still would've
gotten on that carriage.

00:37:29.425 --> 00:37:30.665
I learned from my family's letter

00:37:30.745 --> 00:37:32.705
that Mr. Xiao had secured

00:37:32.785 --> 00:37:35.625
a fine burial plot
for my sister back home,

00:37:35.705 --> 00:37:37.025
so she may rest in peace.

00:37:39.545 --> 00:37:40.785
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

00:37:42.425 --> 00:37:44.705
It's all I could do.

00:37:50.825 --> 00:37:53.105
That day in prison, I was too rash.

00:37:56.145 --> 00:37:57.025
Sorry for my offense.

00:37:59.745 --> 00:38:00.825
I…

00:38:02.425 --> 00:38:03.585
Take care, Mr. Gu.

00:38:04.145 --> 00:38:05.225
We'll be waiting for your return.

00:38:05.865 --> 00:38:06.785
Take care.

00:38:16.705 --> 00:38:18.945
SWALLOW HOUSE

00:38:19.025 --> 00:38:20.625
At the second ke of Shen Hour,

00:38:20.705 --> 00:38:23.425
Pang Erlang presents Liu Ying'er
with a winning prize,

00:38:23.505 --> 00:38:25.185
Peerless Beauty!

00:38:25.265 --> 00:38:28.345
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

00:38:28.425 --> 00:38:30.345
You once said

00:38:30.425 --> 00:38:32.145
the Astronomical Bureau sends apprentices

00:38:32.225 --> 00:38:34.625
to check the water clocks
in the palace and royal mansions.

00:38:35.225 --> 00:38:37.385
Would the bureau keep records
of those apprentices?

00:38:38.785 --> 00:38:39.905
It would.

00:38:40.905 --> 00:38:42.385
Then 15 years ago,

00:38:42.465 --> 00:38:45.345
who was sent
to the Prince of Duan's mansion?

00:38:45.425 --> 00:38:46.345
Can we find out?

00:38:48.425 --> 00:38:50.545
Not sure. It's been so long.

00:38:50.625 --> 00:38:52.025
No telling if the record survived.

00:38:55.385 --> 00:38:57.745
If we don't know, then it might.

00:38:58.345 --> 00:38:59.505
Please help me check.

00:39:06.665 --> 00:39:09.905
TWO APPRENTICES
FROM THE PRINCE OF YAN'S MANSION

00:39:41.585 --> 00:39:43.305
ZI, CHOU, YIN, MAO, CHEN, SI

00:39:43.385 --> 00:39:45.185
CHEN, SI

00:39:45.265 --> 00:39:47.705
BY IMPERIAL COMMAND

00:39:51.505 --> 00:39:54.545
GENTLE RAINS, PROPITIOUS BREEZES

00:40:00.465 --> 00:40:01.345
How is it?

00:40:03.265 --> 00:40:04.185
It's been too long.

00:40:04.265 --> 00:40:05.345
There's no record left.

00:40:07.665 --> 00:40:09.305
Figures. Too much time has passed.

00:40:10.785 --> 00:40:11.785
Thank you.

00:40:21.665 --> 00:40:23.465
In 15 years,

00:40:23.545 --> 00:40:25.905
this is the first time
you asked to see me.

00:40:26.505 --> 00:40:28.225
That night at Prince of Duan's mansion,

00:40:28.305 --> 00:40:30.065
who was the water-clock apprentice?

00:40:31.905 --> 00:40:35.185
Calibrating the clock
is the Astronomical Bureau's duty.

00:40:35.265 --> 00:40:36.625
But that page of records was destroyed.

00:40:37.905 --> 00:40:40.385
And clearly, someone did it long ago.

00:40:41.545 --> 00:40:44.185
She asked you about this?

00:40:47.265 --> 00:40:50.145
If there's no trail, then drop it.

00:40:50.225 --> 00:40:52.065
That apprentice must know something.

00:40:55.265 --> 00:40:56.905
If you don't want her to remember,

00:40:57.505 --> 00:40:59.185
why cling to it?

00:41:03.425 --> 00:41:04.465
She might forget.

00:41:06.145 --> 00:41:07.305
But some things…

00:41:08.505 --> 00:41:09.785
I still remember.

00:41:18.545 --> 00:41:20.585
HANLIANG HALL

00:41:40.465 --> 00:41:43.985
FANGSHENG, PALACE MAID

00:42:57.545 --> 00:43:00.025
Ruisheng!
Can't she shut the door properly?

00:43:05.305 --> 00:43:06.425
Mother.

00:43:15.985 --> 00:43:18.345
Ruisheng even forgot to change the candle.

00:43:19.025 --> 00:43:20.825
- Honestly…
- Mother.

00:43:32.865 --> 00:43:33.985
Mother.
