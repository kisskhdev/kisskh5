1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,972
The sinkholes
appeared with no warning

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,907
- in every country in the world.
-Complete chaos

4
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:10,143
at this hour on the streets of
every major city on the planet.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

6
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:11,744
They're exploding
from the ground.

7
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,346
It seems like, with no warning,
they're exploding

8
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,914
- from the ground.
-Scientists say

9
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,483
the creatures that emerged
from the sinkholes

10
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:18,518
may have been hibernating
for thousands of years.

11
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,320
Their bullets
merely hinder the creatures

12
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:21,954
but don't stop them.

13
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,456
Many nations
have called in the military.

14
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,325
...thousands dead,
no end in sight.

15
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:26,993
People who live
at high altitudes are reporting

16
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,861
that they've seen the Reapers
stop cold at 8,000 feet.

17
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,797
This is Nederland, Colorado.

18
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:32,532
Most of our town is destroyed,
but everything above 8,000 feet

19
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,534
is completely untouched.

20
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,803
Global lifeline
appears to be 8,000 feet.

21
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,838
Authorities are
urging survivors

22
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,873
to stay above that elevation.

23
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,443
8,000 feet is
the global lifeline.

24
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:47,248
If you can get to high ground,
go there now.

25
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,711
MAN
Hey, Hunter.

26
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,447
Everything okay?

27
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,451
Hunter?

28
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,361
I just... just wanted
to see other people.

29
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:24,096
And you said most of the
monsters are sleeping again.

30
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,199
You're on oxygen every night.

31
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:30,804
What if your lungs seized up
when you were running away?

32
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,975
I'm sorry, Dad.

33
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,580
I can't lose you.

34
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,782
I can't.

35
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,052
I need you to understand that.

36
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,453
-  This one's heavy.
- Yeah.

37
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,955
Hold on.

38
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,492
- You got it?
-  Yeah.

39
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:28,461
Hey,
what happened this morning?

40
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:31,230
He went across The Line
to get a better view

41
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,932
of the Red Rock settlement.

42
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,834
Well, he's the only kid
up here.

43
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,603
He's lonely.

44
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,439
He's alive.

45
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,109
Some of us need more
than that, Will.

46
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,977
I mean, we may be safe up here,

47
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,281
but this mountaintop is
like a prison to him.

48
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,485
He didn't just go there
to see Red Rock.

49
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,424
WILL
The Line crosses

50
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,226
Elba Fire Road near there.

51
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,832
It's the last place
he saw his mother.

52
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,790
MAN
Crow's Nest Refuge reports

53
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,726
they sent a party of five
below The Line

54
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,427
to forage for essentials.

55
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,229
Nobody's come back so far,

56
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,031
but they're still
holding out hope.

57
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:47,133
They asked us to send somebody
out to the pinnacle

58
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,101
to look for any signs
they're still out there.

59
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,737
What road did they take?

60
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:53,039
Sugarloaf Run
in the upper valley.

61
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,047
WILL
I get it.

62
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,618
You trust Nina.
But this is a suicide mission.

63
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:13,686
It's not your job
to save the world.

64
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,691
Okay, buddy.

65
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,192
I'm here. I'm here.

66
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,162
Take it easy.

67
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,372
All right. Deep breaths.

68
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,543
Nice and easy. Deep breaths.

69
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,545
Deep breaths.

70
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,480
Nice and easy.

71
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,049
There you go.

72
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,417
Nice and easy.

73
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,289
Oh, I love you, man.

74
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,553
So, the hay
keeps the potato warm

75
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,289
as it grows out of the ground.

76
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,391
When it gets cold,
you put the hay over it,

77
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:29,528
keep the frost off the ground,
keep the potato warm.

78
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,863
All right?

79
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,598
Now, it's about timing,
all right?

80
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,801
When you let it go...

81
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,736
You have to let it go
at the right moment.

82
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,137
Let go of the string.

83
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,639
There you go.

84
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,945
WILL
It's Hunter's birthday.

85
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:49,381
Mm. And you want my last box
of mac and cheese?

86
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,649
I have these to trade.

87
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,585
It's not much, but...

88
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,023
It's enough.

89
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,991
HUNTER
No way!

90
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,392
- How'd you get this?
-Come on.

91
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,929
You know
I got connections, man.

92
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,865
Happy birthday.

93
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,135
Dad, why don't you use
the radio anymore?

94
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:13,572
Oh. We have flags to signal the
other refuges if we need to.

95
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,274
But it's not the same
as talking to them.

96
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,009
It's hard enough
to make enough electricity

97
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,310
for the things
we absolutely need,

98
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,511
like your machine.

99
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,913
Especially in the winter,

100
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,215
with the days being so short.

101
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,255
You're gonna leave, aren't you?

102
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,924
That was your last filter.

103
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,125
We need more.

104
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,360
You get sick again...

105
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,461
Then I won't get sick.

106
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,397
No, it doesn't work like that.

107
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,301
When?

108
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,171
I'm going to be okay.

109
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,314
I got 'em from Charlie.

110
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,817
I'm pretty sure
he's trying to sleep with me.

111
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,118
He's 80.

112
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,053
Well,
after three years up here,

113
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,923
I'm considering it.

114
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:05,657
Where's Hunter?

115
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,327
Sleeping.

116
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,865
It's Friday night, you know.

117
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,466
Is it?

118
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,202
Mm-hmm.

119
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,940
If this was before,
what would you be doing?

120
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,810
I'd probably be at the 19th
hole with my father-in-law.

121
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,647
I'm sorry, I never pictured you
as the country club type, Will.

122
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,249
I wasn't.

123
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,919
But Tara's family loved it.

124
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,454
I hated it.

125
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,925
And now I miss it.

126
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,602
Goddamn it.

127
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,286
We're out of filters, so
I'm-a have to give you a shot.

128
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,478
Hello, Nina.

129
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,147
How are you?

130
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,985
How's the drinking?

131
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,154
Keeps me from killing myself.

132
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,992
How's yours?

133
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,261
Keeps me from killing you.

134
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,167
I'm leaving tomorrow.

135
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,636
For Boulder.

136
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,740
Well, that's probably the last
thing I expected you to say.

137
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,676
I don't have a choice.

138
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,215
You'll die.

139
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,951
They can't be killed.

140
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,685
You believed that,
you wouldn't still have

141
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,722
this pirate flag on your wall.

142
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,992
I found a safe way there.

143
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,732
There is no safe way.

144
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,002
I know every map.

145
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,104
Every route. Two days' walk.

146
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,407
Impossible to stay
above The Line the whole time.

147
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:37,844
Hunter's machine.

148
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,048
The last filter burnt out.

149
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,516
The hospital in Boulder
will have a crate of 'em.

150
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,553
But if I don't go, Hunter dies.

151
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,961
The place was probably looted.

152
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,362
No one had time to loot.

153
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,464
You're gonna have to go
below The Line

154
00:14:58,465 --> 00:14:59,565
at least a dozen times.

155
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,832
You can't survive a dozen

156
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,833
encounters with those things.

157
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,103
You survived.

158
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,304
That was luck.

159
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,839
Luck is not a strategy.

160
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,475
Luck won't help you.

161
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,210
You're the only person
who fought them and lived.

162
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,844
You've studied them for years.

163
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,680
- That'll help me.
- So what? "Do me a favor, Nina.

164
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,415
Let's go. Let's die together."

165
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,917
But last year, you thought
you found a way to kill them

166
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,353
if you could get back
to your old lab.

167
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,888
That's why Tara went with you.

168
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,556
I have a way to Boulder.

169
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:27,259
It's mapped out. We only go
below The Line twice.

170
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,228
Twice?

171
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:30,529
That's not possible.

172
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,863
It is.

173
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,065
Calway Mine.

174
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,267
It goes through the mountain.

175
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,602
A mine?

176
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,936
A fucking mine, Will?

177
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,339
That's your plan?

178
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,840
That's a death trap
by definition.

179
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,409
My company did a big job there.

180
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,377
I walked every inch.

181
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,447
I know those tunnels.

182
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,251
You don't know anything.

183
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,087
You're desperate.

184
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,056
Desperate people get killed.

185
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,224
8:00 a.m.

186
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:00,426
Cathedral Point Overlook.

187
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,094
Who says I'm going?

188
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,363
Everything you've done up here
since day one says that.

189
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:08,200
Shooting at that goddamn
Reaper scale every night.

190
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,469
All you think about
is killing one of these things,

191
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,272
and you need something
from down there to do it.

192
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,107
You owe me this much.

193
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,476
For Tara.

194
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,911
Will.

195
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:24,950
Boulder is 2,000 feet
below The Line.

196
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,385
Even if you make it there,

197
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:27,920
they'll be there waiting
for you.

198
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,191
It only takes one of them.

199
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,627
I know.

200
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:11,297
TARA
Nina.

201
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,132
Nina, it's getting closer.

202
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,102
Nina!

203
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:18,304
-It's coming this way!
-Stay to the right!

204
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,439
I can't hold my breath
any longer.

205
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,973
Shoot! Shoot!

206
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,544
-No, please.
-We're going down!

207
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,013
-Oh, God! Oh, God!
-Please.

208
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,018
I-I can't...

209
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,270
- Thanks.
-No problem.

210
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,541
I have to go tomorrow.

211
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,244
He's got four days,
five at the most.

212
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,679
I'll stay here with him.

213
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,521
Changed the zero to 200 yards,

214
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,258
so you'll be able to engage 'em
from further out.

215
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,593
Oh.

216
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,362
AP rounds.

217
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,364
These are from
my own personal stash.

218
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:21,700
Slow 'em down a bit more
than a regular 556.

219
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,402
Good luck out there.

220
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,205
Thanks.

221
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,941
Were you planning
on telling me?

222
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,543
Huh?

223
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,179
You just gonna run off
and get yourself killed

224
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,215
without saying a word,
like Tara?

225
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,719
I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for.

226
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,787
Yeah, it was.

227
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,888
- Hey, Tim?
-Yeah.

228
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,190
My gear?

229
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,757
Katie, what are you doing?

230
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,593
-Going with you.
-No, you're not.

231
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,295
Not asking permission, Will.
You can't go out there alone.

232
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,062
You need a partner
to watch your back.

233
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,631
Right. Nina's going with me.

234
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,566
Oh, I'm definitely going now.

235
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,101
The town needs you up here.

236
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,703
And I need to see
what's down there.

237
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,038
Why? What's the point?

238
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:03,642
We're rats on a sinking ship,
and we need to find a way off.

239
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,077
No, we don't.
We can survive up here forever.

240
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,546
Everyone except Hunter.

241
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,781
I don't want to live
like this forever, Will.

242
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,483
And we both know
Hunter doesn't, either.

243
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,984
Well, it's not his decision
to make.

244
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,187
Not at eight years old.

245
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,157
We're gonna have to fight them
eventually, Will.

246
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,828
It might as well be today.

247
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,073
We don't need your help.

248
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,775
You don't need anyone's help,
do you, Nina?

249
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,279
You ever seen one
coming for you?

250
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,048
Up close.

251
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,118
Not just a flickering light
in the distance.

252
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,822
The way they tear people apart.

253
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,024
Bullets bounce off them
like nothing.

254
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,093
Unless you hit them
square in the face,

255
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,063
and even then, it just gives
you a few seconds to run.

256
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,502
We're gonna die out there.

257
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,472
But you first.

258
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,298
I won't be gone long.

259
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,865
That's what Mom said.

260
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,234
I'm coming back.

261
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,338
Promise.

262
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,043
WILL
We hit Alta Vista Ski Area,

263
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,812
we might even use the ski lift.

264
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,146
With what power?

265
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,715
They have backup generators.

266
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,016
Which won't work

267
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,885
after sitting idle
for 992 days.

268
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,222
If the batteries aren't
drained, I'll get it running.

269
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,906
So, what's in Boulder, Nina?

270
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,643
My old lab.

271
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,546
I thought you were
a professor at Caltech.

272
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:22,781
Researcher.

273
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,452
Can't teach kids.
They're too stupid.

274
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,556
Caltech students
are too dumb for you?

275
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:32,825
So what's that make us, then?

276
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:37,464
Not Caltech students, Katie.

277
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,340
You could be nice.

278
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,976
At least try.

279
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,312
What's wrong
with not giving a shit?

280
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,920
How do we know there isn't one

281
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,390
hibernating down there?

282
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,792
I'm not picking anything up.

283
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,094
I guess that's not
a compass, is it?

284
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:10,629
No.

285
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,297
Did you find a way
to track 'em?

286
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,166
Uh, bioelectromagnetism.

287
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,267
They generate
their own magnetic fields.

288
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,436
Stronger than ours.

289
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,771
Stronger than any animal
on Earth.

290
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,306
When they're within
a half mile,

291
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,875
the needle is drawn to them.

292
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,951
So, it's two miles
to the ski area?

293
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,488
One mile if we cut
through the forest.

294
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,537
Nina, you're the expert.

295
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:55,674
Any idea why they don't go
above 8,000 feet?

296
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:58,377
Mostly, I'm just hoping
they don't change their minds.

297
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,114
Anything on that?

298
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,985
Nothing yet.
It's quiet for now.

299
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,357
Might be something
we could use.

300
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:01,006
All right.
Still clear on the tracker.

301
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,643
Needle moves, you say so.

302
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,290
Got some ammo here.

303
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,460
A few flares.

304
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:33,606
Jackpot.

305
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,945
- Huh?
- You know how to use that?

306
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:41,880
It's designed
for an 18-year-old

307
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,248
just out of basic training.

308
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:44,650
I'm pretty sure
I can figure it out.

309
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,285
No need.

310
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,656
- So you've done this before?
- I'm from Texas, Will.

311
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:51,957
Well, I'm from Louisiana.

312
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,391
It doesn't mean
my dad taught me

313
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,595
how to use a grenade launcher.

314
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,639
Nina! How's it going?

315
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,344
- Nina, can we please go?
- Will you two just shut up?

316
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,846
I'm looking at a Reaper scale.

317
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,688
If she wants to stay,
just let her.

318
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,323
Just let her.
We don't need her anyway.

319
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:28,994
Actually, you do. Unlike you,
I'm not dead weight.

320
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:31,529
Um, fuck you, Nina.

321
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,364
We both know who
you're trying to fuck, Katie,

322
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,833
and it's not me.

323
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,434
It's your best friend's
husband.

324
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:38,136
You know what?

325
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,005
Who you got killed.

326
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:41,808
Do you remember that?

327
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,475
Shit. Stop it.

328
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:47,779
You bitch.

329
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:52,684
I don't like you, Nina.

330
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,353
I never have.

331
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,492
I don't blame you, Katie.

332
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,034
I'm fine. I'm fine.

333
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,541
Where'd they all come from?

334
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,611
Three years without us.

335
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,749
Hold up. I need a minute.

336
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,984
Top of the mountain's
8,000 feet.

337
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,153
Ten, 15-minute hike,
we're safe.

338
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,956
Or I can try to get
the chairlift working.

339
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:39,658
We'd have to be
faster than that.

340
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:42,962
They're here.

341
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,335
Down there.

342
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,636
Run!

343
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:52,971
We'll never
make it to The Line.

344
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:54,472
-We have to!
- It's too far!

345
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:55,941
We have to try the lift.

346
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:57,008
What if the battery's dead?

347
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,144
She's right!

348
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,049
- Cover me!
- Okay.

349
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:26,538
Come on, Will.

350
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,344
Come on, baby. Come on.

351
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:54,399
Oh, shit. Come on.

352
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,224
Fuck.

353
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,297
Come on, come on.

354
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:50,089
Hit the switch!

355
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,311
Seventy-eight hundred feet.

356
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,312
You have to jump!

357
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,885
Come on, Katie!

358
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,686
Go, go, go! Jump!

359
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,822
Come on!

360
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,333
Shit, I'm out.

361
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,572
- Don't let go!
- I got you. I promise.

362
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:17,143
We're almost there.

363
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:24,615
Hang on!

364
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,151
Eight thousand!

365
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:30,356
We made it. We made it.

366
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:50,041
Run! Run! Run!

367
00:31:55,982 --> 00:31:57,683
Come on, Katie!

368
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,373
Y'all okay?

369
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,443
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

370
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:43,395
18-year-old, single malt.

371
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,075
Those grenades did nothing.

372
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:04,750
To one more night alive.

373
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,530
It is different.

374
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,601
Seeing them up close.

375
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:27,306
We're not meant to share
the planet with those things.

376
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:32,611
Maybe the Jesus freaks
were right.

377
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,515
Maybe the Reapers are
judgment for mankind's sins.

378
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,617
For eating God's apple,
then clear-cutting

379
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,752
the Garden of Eden
with the knowledge it gave us.

380
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,921
I don't buy that.

381
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,857
So what do you buy?

382
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,229
They're Earth's
new apex predators.

383
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,964
And we're prey.

384
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,972
So how do we
take our place back?

385
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,180
They came out of nowhere,
all at once.

386
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,449
No one's had a chance
to study them.

387
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,850
You study something
long enough,

388
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,285
you can figure out
how to kill it.

389
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,222
If it doesn't kill you first.

390
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,395
A lot more of us are gonna die.

391
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,732
But one day,
we're gonna beat them.

392
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:35,241
Three years, day and night,
researching them.

393
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:37,743
Something had to stand out.

394
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:42,513
What they did when they
first came out of the ground.

395
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,082
Which was?

396
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,586
Wipe out 95% of the world's
population in a month.

397
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,589
They didn't stop
to eat or sleep.

398
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,924
They just didn't stop.

399
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:56,228
I don't follow.

400
00:34:57,263 --> 00:35:00,064
Predators kill to eat.

401
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:01,866
The Reapers kill to kill.

402
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:04,068
And they only killed us.

403
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,837
It's like it's all they wanted,
was just to get rid of us.

404
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,141
I don't think there's
some master plan, Nina.

405
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,742
Simply what you said.

406
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,711
They're predators
and we're prey.

407
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:16,047
I didn't say that. Katie did.

408
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,884
So what are you saying?

409
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,990
Nothing. It's just a question.

410
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:27,793
But I want an answer.

411
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,833
TARA
What if Nina's right?

412
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,436
What if she has found
a way to kill those things?

413
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:13,103
WILL
I don't believe her.

414
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,406
- Why not?
- She wants it too badly.

415
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,642
- What does that mean?
- You know what I mean.

416
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:19,644
If anyone could
figure it out, it's her.

417
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,078
She's a physicist.

418
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,647
Yeah, with a Messiah complex.

419
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:24,649
Baby, that's all physicists.
They make a living

420
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,451
unlocking God's secrets.

421
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:29,254
I get it. You trust her.

422
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:31,155
But this is a suicide mission.

423
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,923
It's not your job
to save the world.

424
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,394
- What is my job?
- To stay alive.

425
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:39,196
You would have said something
different when we first met.

426
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,367
That's before you almost died
in childbirth

427
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:46,871
and we had a one-pound infant
clinging to life in the NICU.

428
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,339
This is for Hunter.

429
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,874
No, it's not.

430
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,643
Not for Nina.

431
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,312
This is about her wanting to be

432
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,846
the first person
to kill a Reaper.

433
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,114
And she'll die to do it.

434
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:58,783
She's not suicidal, Will.

435
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:02,320
She's after immortality.

436
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:04,455
Why can't you see that?

437
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:06,156
She doesn't have a family.

438
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,860
She's never had a family.
She ca--

439
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,569
It's just a matter of time
before he runs out of filters.

440
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:20,738
That's a year from now,
at least.

441
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,841
And the Reapers will
still be down there.

442
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:25,744
So what's the difference?

443
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,915
Another year together.

444
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,352
That's the difference.

445
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,084
When we come out,
it'll be close to dark.

446
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:09,854
Can't hit the city at night.

447
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:11,722
There's a ranger station
on the other side.

448
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:14,692
We can stay there
until daybreak.

449
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:16,394
What's the plan in there?

450
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:17,928
This is level nine.

451
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,597
The ladder will take us down
to level eight.

452
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:22,533
We take eight
across the mountain, 2.2 miles.

453
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:26,236
We exit at 8,023 feet,
on the other side,

454
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:29,073
12 miles west of Boulder.

455
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:32,109
Anything below level eight
is under The Line.

456
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,578
We exit at 8,023 feet?

457
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:34,846
That's right.

458
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,115
How exact is that?

459
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,386
Very.

460
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:43,488
How do you know these tunnels
are perfectly straight?

461
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:44,989
That they don't bow
somewhere in the middle?

462
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,424
That would take us
below The Line.

463
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:48,259
Or did you not think
about that?

464
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,465
- Oh, you son of a bitch.
- Easy.

465
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,602
We're going below The Line,
aren't we?

466
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:03,208
- Will?
- For how long?

467
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,077
231 yards.

468
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,313
What?

469
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:12,249
Both ends of the tunnel are
above 8,000 feet, so...

470
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,786
So, nothing! These tunnels
are not hermetically sealed.

471
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,287
How do you know
there aren't any fissures

472
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,023
that lead to the lower levels
of the mine?

473
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,091
You should have told us this
before we left the refuge.

474
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,693
It's 231 yards.

475
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,829
And besides,
your tracker will tell us

476
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,330
if one of them is
within a half a mile.

477
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:28,599
- No, it won't.
- It just did.

478
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,100
Above ground.

479
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,536
It's not gonna work
under a mile of rock.

480
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:34,171
It's 45 seconds.
Why are you so worried?

481
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,506
They come from
underground, Will.

482
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:37,542
They're built for it.
We're not.

483
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:39,343
They can see in the dark.

484
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,546
They detect the smallest amount
of CO2, which we exhale

485
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:43,347
and will build up
pretty fucking fast

486
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:44,583
inside a fucking mine.

487
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:47,252
Fuck.

488
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,055
You swear a lot.

489
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,458
Fuck you, Katie.

490
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:55,894
- That's good.
-  Let's go.

491
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,440
What's wrong?

492
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,242
See my earlier comment
about the tracker

493
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:20,278
not working
underneath a mountain.

494
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:55,180
No.

495
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:57,782
No.

496
00:41:57,783 --> 00:41:59,283
No, no, no, no, no.

497
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,018
No! No!

498
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,858
It's welded shut?

499
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,995
What now?

500
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:17,201
Climb down to level seven.

501
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,969
That's below The Line, Will.

502
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,339
- Yeah.
- For how long?

503
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:25,042
About a thousand yards.

504
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,277
A thousand yards?

505
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,179
That's ten football fields.

506
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,881
I mean,
how-how steep are these cliffs

507
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,116
that we're trying to avoid?

508
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:34,018
They're impassable.

509
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:36,486
So either we climb down
or we go back.

510
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,523
And I'm not going back.

511
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,849
Either of you guys afraid
of heights?

512
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,085
No, I'm afraid of monsters.

513
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,732
So, what do we do
when we get to the bottom?

514
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:23,668
- We just start sprinting?
- No, we can't sprint across.

515
00:43:23,669 --> 00:43:26,236
We'll just exhaust ourselves
and make too much noise.

516
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:28,405
Worse than that--
we'll quadruple our CO2 output,

517
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:30,775
which they can track
from a mile away.
That's what that light is

518
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:31,777
at the end of
the tentacles.

519
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,611
They track us
like giant mosquitoes.

520
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:36,180
Great.

521
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:38,216
So, slow and steady.

522
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:42,386
- Are we ready?
- No.

523
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:44,790
Just need a minute
to ponder my own death.

524
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,427
You're funnier than I realized.

525
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:51,862
Thanks.

526
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:53,932
You're smarter than I realized.

527
00:43:57,502 --> 00:43:59,704
So, where were you
when they showed up?

528
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:05,710
Well, the night
before the Reapers appeared...

529
00:44:07,412 --> 00:44:09,815
...my boyfriend and I
had gotten into an argument.

530
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,918
And he took a swing at me
and broke my nose.

531
00:44:13,919 --> 00:44:15,219
- What?
- Yeah.

532
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,486
What'd you do?

533
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,155
I hit him with a frying pan

534
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,424
and stole his car
and drove it to Nederland.

535
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:22,059
That's fair.

536
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,162
Anyway, next morning,

537
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,897
I heard everything happening
over the radio,

538
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:29,900
so I just went straight up
the fire road till the end

539
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:32,002
and found the refuge.

540
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,706
- Life's a bitch sometimes.
- Yep.

541
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:38,776
And then giant murder bugs
hatch from the ground,

542
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:41,578
and it's amazing how quick
nostalgia sets in.

543
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:45,116
You should be
a motivational speaker.

544
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:48,854
Can we get down this ladder, please?

545
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,428
This way.

546
00:46:00,225 --> 00:46:02,093
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

547
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:05,696
I think there's
something back there.

548
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:07,932
I don't see anything.

549
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:09,968
I heard something.

550
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,771
- Or maybe I'm just being crazy.
- Wait.

551
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,907
- Cover your light.
- What?

552
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:18,776
Please do it.

553
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,755
Is that...?

554
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:36,193
Move!

555
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:49,439
Duck!

556
00:47:07,225 --> 00:47:09,260
Go, go, go, go!

557
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,969
Oh, shit.

558
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,539
Will! Will! In here!

559
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:25,910
It ends.

560
00:47:25,911 --> 00:47:27,144
Go, go, go!

561
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:29,347
Will, it's a dead end. Shit.

562
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:37,321
Over here! Come on!

563
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:39,423
Turn off your headlamps.

564
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:41,025
They can still track us
through the CO2.

565
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:43,260
- So what do we do?
-  Don't breathe.

566
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:05,742
- There's a way out!
- Go, go, go!

567
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,645
Go, go, go, go, go!

568
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:13,284
Hurry!

569
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,422
Go!

570
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,094
Will!

571
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:26,930
Will, Will, Will, come on.

572
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:28,232
Come on.

573
00:49:28,233 --> 00:49:30,934
- Come on!
- Come on, run!

574
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:33,203
Katie, wait for us! Katie!

575
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:35,240
There's an exit!

576
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:38,142
Katie!

577
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:39,777
Katie!

578
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:54,791
Katie, no!

579
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:57,262
Will!

580
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,602
No.

581
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:13,278
She's gone.

582
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,147
She's gone.

583
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,583
Oh, my God.

584
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:21,918
It led right back into
the tunnel we came through.

585
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:25,955
What was she thinking?

586
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:29,626
It's coming back.

587
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:31,695
What's that?

588
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:33,331
What?

589
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:40,638
Oh, my God. It's a ladder.

590
00:50:46,677 --> 00:50:48,212
Will, come on!

591
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,026
Katie.

592
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:42,432
You still believe in God?

593
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,135
I'm stubborn.

594
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:48,406
What'd you ask for?

595
00:51:51,576 --> 00:51:53,378
Revenge.

596
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:28,037
Looks okay.
You think it'll start?

597
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,540
If there's a fresh battery
inside.

598
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:34,511
Tires are kind of ratty,
but it'll do.

599
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:27,598
I must have made
a thousand boxes of this stuff.

600
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,868
Every night,
Tara would ask Hunter

601
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:35,204
what did he want for dinner,
and every night--

602
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,741
mac and cheese.

603
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:40,744
It's the casein,
the milk protein in cheese.

604
00:54:40,745 --> 00:54:43,147
It's like an opioid,
as addictive as morphine.

605
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:51,155
Sorry.

606
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,335
I really liked Tara.

607
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:10,408
Seems like that was the
last person you liked, Nina.

608
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:17,246
Katie grew on me.

609
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,650
Guess I got her killed, too.

610
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:24,954
I should have never
brought us in those mines.

611
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:26,623
Would have been easier
scaling the mountain

612
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:29,158
with no equipment.

613
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,428
You want to make
her death matter?

614
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:32,629
Don't feel guilt.

615
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,665
Feel anger.

616
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:39,168
I don't feel anything anymore.

617
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,604
That's too bad.

618
00:55:40,605 --> 00:55:42,138
Anger's a terrible thing
to waste.

619
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:44,140
You would know.

620
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:46,444
So would you.

621
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,416
I don't hate you, Nina.

622
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:54,150
Yeah, you do.

623
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:55,953
I would.

624
00:56:00,891 --> 00:56:02,660
What's in your old lab?

625
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,432
Periclase.

626
00:56:08,433 --> 00:56:10,634
Cubic version
of magnesium oxide.

627
00:56:10,635 --> 00:56:12,236
Okay.

628
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:16,506
The Reapers' scales--
they're impenetrable.

629
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:18,875
I think it's because
they're electrically charged.

630
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,877
A defense mechanism, I think.

631
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,246
You think?

632
00:56:24,348 --> 00:56:27,116
If I'm right,
a projectile, a bullet,

633
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:29,318
bonded with periclase,
it hits them,

634
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,655
and theoretically,
it creates a momentary

635
00:56:31,656 --> 00:56:34,390
million-volt differential,
and boom.

636
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,494
Uncontrollable
internal combustion.

637
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,963
A magic bullet?

638
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:42,165
That's what you've been
working on all this time?

639
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:44,534
Literally a magic bullet?

640
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:46,335
It's not magic. It's science.

641
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:48,805
- It's a guess.
- It's a hypothesis.

642
00:56:48,806 --> 00:56:51,576
With a healthy dose
of wishful thinking.

643
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:57,715
Tara believed me.

644
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:03,921
Tara would believe anything
she thought could save Hunter.

645
00:57:05,456 --> 00:57:06,923
You knew that,

646
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,093
talked her into going
and got them all killed.

647
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:13,297
My wife, our friends.

648
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,634
I told her not to go.

649
00:57:17,968 --> 00:57:20,638
I told her
listening to you was suicide.

650
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:28,612
And yet, here you are.

651
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:31,782
With me,
standing on that same ledge.

652
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:01,746
Here we go.

653
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:19,990
Jesus.

654
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:22,893
Fifth floor.

655
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,075
This way.

656
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,910
Don't look.

657
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:15,813
I have to.

658
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,572
Where are they?

659
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,308
There should be cases
of 'em in here.

660
01:00:47,611 --> 01:00:50,213
- Was that...?
- Can't tell.

661
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:52,082
Nothing on the tracker.

662
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:55,985
Where else could they be?

663
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,987
Uh, the OR.

664
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,491
That's one, no question.

665
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,946
WILL
Here.

666
01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:32,688
- Come on, Will, we got to go.
- I know.

667
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,793
Shit. It's close.

668
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:38,395
I'm looking. I'm looking.

669
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:42,932
I got 'em!

670
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:44,600
All right, come on.

671
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,636
Come on, come on, come on!

672
01:01:47,671 --> 01:01:49,073
Okay.

673
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,193
Come on.

674
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:16,866
Jesus fucking Christ!

675
01:02:42,026 --> 01:02:43,726
Holy fuck!

676
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,538
Go. Go.

677
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,609
Here! In here.

678
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:06,950
- Now we're trapped.
- No, we're not.

679
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:23,466
Stairs.

680
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:25,769
- What are you doing?
- I'm right behind you.

681
01:04:19,056 --> 01:04:20,856
I thought I told you to run.

682
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,893
And I didn't listen.

683
01:04:29,133 --> 01:04:30,867
Is it dead?

684
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:34,004
It's not moving.

685
01:04:41,745 --> 01:04:43,146
Yeah, but...

686
01:04:43,147 --> 01:04:45,715
Right. We should
get the hell out of here.

687
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,217
The lab is close.

688
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,219
- There's no time.
- I still need periclase.

689
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,221
- The magnesium oxide.
- I have Hunter to think about.

690
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,822
This is about more
than just your son.

691
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,391
There's no such thing
as more than my son.

692
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,160
How much time
did you just buy yourself?

693
01:04:57,161 --> 01:04:59,662
Six months? A year? Then you're
right back here again.

694
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:01,664
Or we can prove
that they can be killed,

695
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:03,666
and when we fly that flag
over the refuge,

696
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:06,302
everyone else stuck on those
mountaintops will know it.

697
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,704
The whole world will come
and fight with us.

698
01:05:08,705 --> 01:05:11,507
The odds may be stacked
against us, but I'm with Katie.

699
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:13,509
We can't live like this
forever.

700
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,545
Sooner or later,
we have to fight them.

701
01:05:16,713 --> 01:05:18,747
But I need your help.

702
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,784
I can't do this alone.

703
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:26,022
Shit.

704
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:27,457
Let's go.

705
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,986
Scale.

706
01:06:47,037 --> 01:06:49,039
Nothing on the tracker.

707
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,175
I'm gonna need five minutes.

708
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:53,843
I'll keep watch.

709
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,025
Thank God.

710
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:47,564
I never knew you had a family.

711
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:53,703
Well, I did.

712
01:07:55,205 --> 01:07:56,705
You never said a word.

713
01:07:56,706 --> 01:07:58,508
No.

714
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:07,350
Let's let this dry,
see what happens.

715
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:09,185
Gonna take a few minutes.

716
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:11,788
Figured you might want this.

717
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:37,981
I was here when it happened.

718
01:08:40,217 --> 01:08:42,251
It was a Saturday, but...

719
01:08:42,252 --> 01:08:45,020
but my team was close
to a breakthrough,

720
01:08:45,021 --> 01:08:47,523
using cobalt to increase
the electron flow in batteries.

721
01:08:47,524 --> 01:08:49,326
Makes 'em
three times more efficient.

722
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:56,300
That's what I was thinking
about when the world ended.

723
01:08:58,101 --> 01:08:59,836
Batteries.

724
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:08,110
Billy, my seven-year-old,
had a soccer game that day.

725
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:09,912
You ever seen kids that age
play soccer?

726
01:09:09,913 --> 01:09:12,282
How they all just converge
on the ball at once?

727
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:21,758
The worst part is,
I chose not to go to that game.

728
01:09:30,066 --> 01:09:32,668
My husband had
been traveling for two weeks,

729
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:35,137
and he came back.

730
01:09:35,138 --> 01:09:37,173
I was...

731
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:43,213
I was tired of being a mom.

732
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:47,015
But there's nothing
you could have done.

733
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:50,053
I could have held him
in my arms one last time.

734
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,667
I'm sure you've had
the same thought about Tara.

735
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:12,140
I never should have
encouraged her to come with me.

736
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:13,709
I was overconfident.

737
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,778
I thought I'd figured out a way
to hold them off,

738
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:17,780
and I was wrong.

739
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:19,448
If it's any consolation,
I hate myself more

740
01:10:19,449 --> 01:10:22,085
than you could possibly
hate me.

741
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:28,157
I only blame you because it's
easier than blaming myself.

742
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:32,528
I knew she was going to go,

743
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:34,564
even after I tried to stop her.

744
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:38,200
And I let it happen.

745
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:39,635
You can't blame yourself.

746
01:10:39,636 --> 01:10:41,671
Neither of us can.

747
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:44,908
What's the point?

748
01:10:51,415 --> 01:10:53,417
All right.

749
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:15,604
You tried, Nina.

750
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:18,541
You did everything you could.

751
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:20,008
Go home, Will.

752
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:22,445
Go save your son.

753
01:11:22,446 --> 01:11:24,247
He's running out of time.

754
01:11:25,248 --> 01:11:27,416
- What about you?
- I'm gonna stay.

755
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:29,385
There are other things
I can try.

756
01:11:29,386 --> 01:11:31,520
Look, I'm not leaving you here.
We're in this together.

757
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:33,088
And you got me here.

758
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:34,723
But it didn't work,
and I'm not leaving

759
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:36,559
until it does
or until they kill me first.

760
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,293
- Nina...
- Look,

761
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,195
my car is still
in the lot outside.

762
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:43,532
If I get this right, I won't
need your help to get back.

763
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:46,234
I'll be on the road
right behind you.

764
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:49,572
If I don't...

765
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:51,675
there's no point
in you dying here with me.

766
01:11:53,577 --> 01:11:55,479
Go.

767
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,482
Go be with Hunter.

768
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:51,954
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

769
01:15:17,113 --> 01:15:18,548
Shit.

770
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:31,454
Oh, shit.

771
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:43,099
Oh, shit.

772
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:45,494
Son of a bitch.

773
01:18:04,781 --> 01:18:06,515
They're machines.

774
01:18:08,484 --> 01:18:10,652
They hunt us,
but they don't eat us.

775
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:13,088
They don't sleep.
They don't breathe.

776
01:18:13,089 --> 01:18:15,791
They don't go an inch
above 8,000 feet.

777
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:17,625
That's not a living creature.

778
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:19,896
That's programming.

779
01:18:20,964 --> 01:18:22,799
By who?

780
01:18:34,677 --> 01:18:36,579
Good shot.

781
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:39,215
Thanks.

782
01:18:45,021 --> 01:18:47,189
Why 8,000 feet?

783
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:49,025
I have no idea.

784
01:18:59,002 --> 01:19:01,003
Is your car still running?

785
01:19:01,004 --> 01:19:03,039
Radiator blew half a mile back.

786
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:07,309
God, it felt amazing
to kill those fuckers.

787
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:09,845
Going to feel even better
when you raise that pirate flag

788
01:19:09,846 --> 01:19:12,414
and tell the world
we have a way to beat 'em.

789
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:34,637
Dad!

790
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:40,442
Told you I was coming back.

791
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:42,311
I missed you so much.

792
01:19:52,655 --> 01:19:53,990
Come on.

793
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:17,880
Oh, you see it? They did it!

794
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:27,322
MAN
Crow's Nest, this is Red Rock.

795
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,790
Are you seeing
what we're seeing?

796
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:30,158
WOMAN
We have line of sight...

797
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,060
MAN 2
Yes. Confirmed.

798
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:33,595
- We have clear line of sight.
-Copy that. This is...

799
01:20:33,596 --> 01:20:35,664
WILL
This is Lost Gulch Refuge.

800
01:20:38,201 --> 01:20:40,735
Three years ago,

801
01:20:40,736 --> 01:20:43,472
the world we knew
disappeared overnight.

802
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:49,577
We lost our homes,

803
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:52,347
our communities

804
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,850
and most of the people
we loved.

805
01:20:59,455 --> 01:21:03,292
We still don't know why
above 8,000 feet we were safe.

806
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:08,564
But we don't have to play
by those rules anymore.

807
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:16,572
The Reapers tried
to take our planet.

808
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:22,078
They thought we'd die up here
in these mountains.

809
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:34,590
Well, we're still here.

810
01:21:57,346 --> 01:22:00,616
Sooner or later,
we had to fight them.

811
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:06,021
Might as well be today.
