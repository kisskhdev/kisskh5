WEBVTT

00:18.061 --> 00:19.062
Sorry.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.759
I don't have all
night, sweetheart.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.718
Yeah, right. Not
gonna happen.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.285
You didn't even
check my card, man!

00:24.415 --> 00:25.286
Next!

00:25.416 --> 00:26.765
Hey, what's up?

00:26.896 --> 00:30.856
Seriously? That's me in the
picture, Charlie Gibson!

00:30.987 --> 00:32.597
Come on in,
ladies.

00:32.728 --> 00:35.209
- Really?
- Listen, it's not your night.

00:35.339 --> 00:36.732
Dude, if you know
how to do math,

00:36.862 --> 00:38.473
you'll see I
just turned 21.

00:38.603 --> 00:39.778
Whatever. Get in.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.476
OK. Go on in.

00:41.606 --> 00:42.564
Thank you.

01:11.593 --> 01:12.420
Jack.

01:16.685 --> 01:17.425
Hello?

01:19.427 --> 01:21.385
Whoa, whoa, slow down.
I can barely understa--

01:23.387 --> 01:25.302
Have you been drinking?

01:25.433 --> 01:26.695
It's Charlie.

01:26.825 --> 01:27.783
Put her on
speaker.

01:29.915 --> 01:31.743
Hey, Charlie? It's
Dad. Can you hear me?

01:31.874 --> 01:36.313
<i>Dad. I need help. I</i><i>
need... picked up.</i>

01:36.444 --> 01:37.749
Where are you?

01:37.880 --> 01:41.318
<i>217 Scott Street. Please hurry.</i>

01:41.449 --> 01:43.712
OK, stay right
there; I'm on my way.

01:43.842 --> 01:47.629
<i>No! Please don't</i><i>
hurt me! I'll do anything!</i>

01:47.759 --> 01:48.630
Charlie!

01:48.760 --> 01:49.631
It got disconnected.

01:50.936 --> 01:51.720
Call her back.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.637
<i>Hey! You've reached Charlie.</i>

01:55.767 --> 01:57.682
It went straight to voice mail.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.684
You stay here in
case she comes back.

02:10.913 --> 02:12.567
Call me as soon
as you pick her up.

02:12.697 --> 02:14.003
- I will.
- Be careful.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.526
- I love you.
- I love you too.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.016
<i>Hey, you've reached Charlie.</i>

02:27.147 --> 02:28.409
<i>Please leave a message</i><i>
after the beep.</i>

02:40.160 --> 02:41.596
<i>DAD! HELP ME!</i>

02:41.726 --> 02:42.553
Charlie?

02:43.467 --> 02:44.425
Charlie, where are you?

02:45.513 --> 02:47.210
Charlie, say something, please!

02:47.341 --> 02:47.863
<i>Help me!</i>

02:48.994 --> 02:49.865
Where are you?

02:51.736 --> 02:52.172
Charlie!

03:32.212 --> 03:33.387
Charlie, oh my God.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.606
Why are you still up, Mila?

03:38.348 --> 03:39.523
Oh!

03:39.654 --> 03:41.482
What are you doing!

03:41.612 --> 03:44.485
Your phone call nearly
scared the life out of us.

03:44.615 --> 03:46.661
Your father is out there
looking for you right now.

03:46.791 --> 03:49.054
Call? What call?

03:49.185 --> 03:52.754
You called him! You were
crying, asking to be picked up.

03:52.884 --> 03:55.235
No. I never called Dad.

03:57.411 --> 04:00.240
My phone's been
dead for hours. See?

04:05.549 --> 04:06.724
That's impossible!

04:09.466 --> 04:11.425
<i>It wasn't me!</i>

04:11.555 --> 04:15.559
I swear it was your
voice, your screams...

04:15.690 --> 04:17.735
the way you speak when you cry.

04:17.866 --> 04:20.695
I told you my phone's dead.

04:20.825 --> 04:24.699
I was... at a friend's
place; they'll tell you.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.962
Maybe you drank too much,
and you don't remember...

04:27.092 --> 04:27.832
I mean, this wouldn't be...

04:35.753 --> 04:37.668
Hi. I'm Detective Faulkner.

04:37.799 --> 04:39.801
Are you Mila Gibson?
Can I come in for a minute?

04:39.931 --> 04:41.281
Yes, please.

04:46.721 --> 04:47.461
This way.

04:54.511 --> 04:58.820
Hi, Charlie. I'm
Detective Faulkner.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.519
Did you find my dad?

05:02.650 --> 05:06.567
We have a team at 217
Scott Street as we speak.

05:10.179 --> 05:11.659
I'll need to take this.

05:12.790 --> 05:13.791
<i>Faulkner</i><i>
speaking.</i>

05:21.973 --> 05:23.845
So it's confirmed then?

05:25.586 --> 05:27.892
<i>Sit tight. I'll be right there.</i>

05:28.023 --> 05:28.980
What is it?

05:29.111 --> 05:30.678
Did they find him?

05:33.768 --> 05:35.509
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.645
The body that we found was...
was your father.

05:44.605 --> 05:45.649
I'm so sorry.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.818
<i>Hey, it's Matthew.</i><i>
You know the drill.</i>

06:23.948 --> 06:26.603
Matthew, why the hell
are you ignoring me?

06:26.734 --> 06:27.822
I need you!

06:30.172 --> 06:33.218
Dad's been... shot.

06:33.349 --> 06:35.830
Someone killed him.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.571
Please call me back!

06:44.621 --> 06:46.797
<i>Where are you?</i>

06:46.928 --> 06:52.760
<i>217 Scott</i><i>
Street. Please hurry!</i>

06:52.890 --> 06:55.240
<i>OK stay right</i><i>
there. I'm on my way!</i>

06:55.371 --> 06:59.114
<i>No, please! Don't hurt</i><i>
me! I'll do anything!</i>

06:59.244 --> 07:01.029
<i>Charlie!</i>

07:01.159 --> 07:02.770
<i>And that's</i><i>
where the call drops.</i>

07:04.815 --> 07:06.251
It wasn't me.

07:06.382 --> 07:07.775
I'll be checking
your call history

07:07.905 --> 07:09.167
as well as your father's.

07:09.298 --> 07:10.821
We know he recorded his calls,

07:10.952 --> 07:12.780
so we'll see what
else we can find.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.608
Is this process long or...?

07:14.738 --> 07:16.479
No. We should know
more soon enough.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.840
<i>Jack was my best friend!</i>

07:29.971 --> 07:33.061
I can't believe you
didn't call me last night!

07:33.191 --> 07:35.455
Why the hell did I have to hear
about this from my ex-wife?

07:36.325 --> 07:37.631
How come Melody knows?

07:39.720 --> 07:41.722
I called her.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.593
I'm sorry, Tim, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

07:45.769 --> 07:48.032
What? She's my Godmother!
I don't get why

07:48.163 --> 07:50.644
you have such a problem with
me telling her about it.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.254
I don't. I would
just rather you--

07:52.384 --> 07:55.736
Mila, I don't understand why
you stopped talking to Melody.

07:55.866 --> 07:58.260
But it's clear to me that
she's upset about it.

07:58.390 --> 08:00.044
I have my reasons.

08:00.175 --> 08:02.786
Sure. And you can't
tell me just cause I'm 16!

08:05.833 --> 08:09.314
I can't. I'm late.
I'm meeting Melody.

08:11.578 --> 08:12.840
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you earlier.

08:41.433 --> 08:44.001
Oh, honey, come here! Come here.

08:47.178 --> 08:51.139
I don't understand any of this.
Who would want to kill Dad?

08:54.055 --> 08:58.059
I don't know.
Everybody loves Jack.

08:59.669 --> 09:00.888
<i>I lied.</i>

09:02.019 --> 09:04.065
About what?

09:04.195 --> 09:07.677
I told Mila and the detective

09:07.808 --> 09:10.680
that I was at a friend's
house last night but...

09:12.508 --> 09:15.816
I was at the Moonlight
Bar.

09:15.946 --> 09:19.776
Honey. It's OK...

09:19.907 --> 09:21.691
but you do need to
tell them the truth

09:21.822 --> 09:22.997
before they find
out on their own.

09:24.955 --> 09:28.176
If I had just stayed home
instead of acting out,

09:28.306 --> 09:30.265
Dad would have never
had to run and save me,

09:30.395 --> 09:31.658
and he would still be alive.

09:31.788 --> 09:35.444
No! Charlie, you do not
blame yourself for this.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.708
Of course you wanted
to blow off some steam.

09:38.839 --> 09:41.102
OK? They shouldn't have fought
like that in front of you.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.019
You don't put too much
on your shoulders, OK?

09:45.149 --> 09:48.022
OK.

09:56.334 --> 09:57.292
Matthew texted me.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.469
That's good.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.602
I'm gonna see him around 10.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.952
He told his parents
about my dad.

10:05.082 --> 10:08.085
I can't even imagine
how Rebecca and Harrison

10:08.216 --> 10:11.175
are feeling right now.
They were so close to Jack.

10:11.306 --> 10:15.179
Yeah.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.790
They were friends
before I was even born.

10:20.402 --> 10:21.142
What are you doing?

10:23.187 --> 10:24.449
Packing.

10:24.841 --> 10:27.148
I can see that!

10:27.278 --> 10:28.323
Why are you packing?

10:33.502 --> 10:36.853
I understand how
you must feel.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.942
Jack was your best friend and--

10:39.073 --> 10:41.684
I don't think you
understand, Rebecca cause...

10:41.815 --> 10:44.121
right now, I don't
even know how I feel.

10:53.957 --> 10:56.133
Maybe you should consider
seeing a therapist?

10:59.615 --> 11:03.140
What I need is to spend some
time alone and clear my head.

11:07.971 --> 11:09.146
I'm gonna spend some
time at the cabin.

11:50.013 --> 11:53.843
Hey. I'm so sorry
about everything. I...

11:59.762 --> 12:03.897
I don't know what to
say. It's terrible, I...

12:04.027 --> 12:08.553
OK.

12:08.684 --> 12:11.992
I need some air.

12:12.122 --> 12:16.170
I wasn't sober last night
but I'm telling the truth.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.302
I didn't call Mila.

12:18.433 --> 12:19.434
I believe you.

12:21.566 --> 12:24.526
It was so scary.

12:24.656 --> 12:28.182
The detective played the
phone call so I could hear.

12:28.312 --> 12:31.141
It was my voice, Matt!

12:31.272 --> 12:33.361
Check this out.

12:33.491 --> 12:36.103
AI scams are more
common than we think.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.061
Hey. I heard about this.

12:40.890 --> 12:44.633
It says here that you only need
three seconds of someone's voice

12:44.764 --> 12:47.418
to duplicate it to almost a tee.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.725
It's really hard to detect,

12:49.856 --> 12:51.509
especially if we think our
loved ones are in danger.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.076
Scams like this,

12:53.207 --> 12:55.600
they're usually used to
ask for a ransom, not to--

12:55.731 --> 12:59.300
I know. It's obvious now that
someone wanted to target my dad.

13:02.651 --> 13:06.786
They basically called him
there just to... kill him.

13:08.526 --> 13:09.310
Who would want him dead?

13:11.399 --> 13:13.183
He put so many
criminals in jail

13:13.314 --> 13:15.098
back when he was
district attorney

13:17.405 --> 13:20.974
The list of people angry
with him? It's a long one.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.512
Rebecca. Hi.

13:37.642 --> 13:43.431
Mila. Hi. I don't know what to
say. I-I made you a lasagna.

13:43.561 --> 13:44.736
I figured the last thing

13:44.867 --> 13:47.130
you need to be worrying
about is cooking.

13:47.261 --> 13:50.133
Thank you. Please come in.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.619
It makes me happy that
Charlie's with Matthew.

13:57.749 --> 14:00.187
She's been missing him a lot.

14:00.317 --> 14:04.147
Matt hasn't been
acting himself lately.

14:04.278 --> 14:07.107
I'll chalk it up to teenage
hormones.

14:13.026 --> 14:13.983
What's going on?

14:14.114 --> 14:15.419
It's nothing.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.595
Mila... I've known you
long enough to know

14:17.726 --> 14:20.294
when something's wrong.

14:20.424 --> 14:23.950
It started this morning. I'm
receiving threatening texts.

14:24.080 --> 14:28.302
Jack was first... You're
next. You'll be reunited soon.

14:28.432 --> 14:30.695
Oh, my God! Have
you told the police?

14:30.826 --> 14:32.872
I did. The detective
that's working on the case

14:33.002 --> 14:35.613
should call me back
this afternoon.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.093
They're trying to track
down who's sending me

14:37.224 --> 14:38.094
these messages.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.269
This is serious.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.357
Yeah. I just...

14:42.490 --> 14:44.796
I don't know how to tell Charlie

14:44.927 --> 14:46.407
but she needs to know
that we're not safe.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.457
You sure you don't want
me to walk you home?

14:53.588 --> 14:55.590
Come on, Matt! It's
five minutes away.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.244
I've been walking
alone since I was 6!

14:58.549 --> 14:59.594
See you soon!

16:01.830 --> 16:02.657
Hey!

16:06.226 --> 16:07.270
Who are you?

16:10.708 --> 16:12.928
<i>If there's someone</i><i>
after us, we're not safe here!</i>

16:13.059 --> 16:14.974
<i>Between this and</i><i>
threatening texts I've</i>

16:15.104 --> 16:19.021
<i>been getting, the police have</i><i>
agreed to park a car out front</i>

16:19.152 --> 16:21.632
Mila, we may be safe in the
house, but what's gonna happen

16:21.763 --> 16:23.199
when we have to leave?

16:23.330 --> 16:25.332
We're just gonna have
to be extremely careful.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.551
Going out only when necessary

16:27.682 --> 16:30.206
and taking precautions
when we do.

16:30.337 --> 16:33.340
Always texting each
other where we are.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.516
I can't stay locked
up in here forever.

16:39.607 --> 16:41.348
Everything reminds me of Dad.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.352
I love you.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.175
Charlie, wait!

18:09.305 --> 18:11.481
Stop following me! The
police are right there.

18:11.612 --> 18:16.791
Charlie, I... I don't want to
hurt you. I'm um... I'm Alyssa,

18:19.750 --> 18:21.622
Alyssa Price, your mother.

18:30.761 --> 18:33.503
You can ask him if
you don't believe me.

18:33.634 --> 18:36.376
He checked my ID before
I walked to the door.

18:37.768 --> 18:40.945
No, you're not allowed
to be anywhere near me!

18:41.076 --> 18:43.339
Did it change cause my dad died?

18:43.470 --> 18:46.255
No, it changed when
you turned sixteen.

18:46.386 --> 18:49.780
My dad never mentioned
anything about our situation

18:49.911 --> 18:51.391
being different
when I was older.

18:51.521 --> 18:54.568
I'm telling the truth. I have
the court order. But...

18:54.698 --> 18:56.526
if you're not
ready, I understand.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.572
I've been sixteen for a while.

18:58.702 --> 19:00.139
Why come now?

19:02.010 --> 19:06.014
I um... I moved back
to town two months ago.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.364
I'm living at my
sister's place.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.236
She has a house near the
park you walk through

19:10.366 --> 19:11.150
to get to school.

19:12.673 --> 19:16.677
Believe me, I tried many,
many times to talk to you,

19:16.807 --> 19:19.636
but I just couldn't build
up the courage before today.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.685
It's been so long.

19:24.815 --> 19:27.253
Eleven years. Yeah.

19:29.429 --> 19:31.518
I just came to say that I
hope one day you'll agree

19:31.648 --> 19:33.433
on hearing my side of the story.

19:33.563 --> 19:36.523
Well, today
isn't that day.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.046
Would you just at
least take this

19:38.177 --> 19:39.482
and read it over
whenever you're ready?

19:39.613 --> 19:42.659
My number is on it if you
ever want to hear me out.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.492
I'm really sorry about your dad.

20:04.594 --> 20:06.944
I'm not going
to school tomorrow.

20:07.075 --> 20:09.773
I'm not going to
school tomorrow.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.688
I'm not
going to school tomorrow.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.215
Matt?

20:16.345 --> 20:17.564
Never heard of knocking?

20:19.870 --> 20:21.568
I'm trying to figure
out how AI works.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.787
It's way easier than I thought.

20:23.918 --> 20:26.660
You can't have
this on your phone!

20:26.790 --> 20:28.618
Not with what just
happened to Jack!

20:28.749 --> 20:32.796
I'm just trying to help.
Charlie seemed so scared!

20:32.927 --> 20:34.885
You need to delete
this app right now!

20:35.016 --> 20:37.888
Can you imagine if the police
found this on your phone?

20:38.019 --> 20:40.456
What? It's not like I
have something to hide.

20:43.633 --> 20:44.939
Delete it now!

21:08.876 --> 21:10.399
Hey.

21:11.531 --> 21:11.922
It's done!

21:13.924 --> 21:15.491
I talked to Charlie.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.319
It's about time!

21:17.450 --> 21:19.190
How did she react?

21:19.321 --> 21:23.456
She let me talk a bit and
she took the court order

21:23.586 --> 21:26.633
before basically shutting
me down.

21:26.763 --> 21:29.157
So... I guess it went OK.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.291
It's a start. I'm
proud of you.

21:34.380 --> 21:39.515
Thank you for pushing and
supporting me through all this.

21:39.646 --> 21:40.560
Of course!

21:45.129 --> 21:49.786
Um... there was a police
car parked outside

21:49.917 --> 21:52.311
of Jack's house
when I was there.

21:52.441 --> 21:53.964
A cop came to talk to me.

21:54.095 --> 21:56.053
Really? What did he want?

21:56.184 --> 21:59.622
They asked me to go to the
station for questioning.

21:59.753 --> 22:03.452
They wanted to know where I was
the night that Jack was killed

22:03.583 --> 22:07.238
and why I decided to
reconnect with Charlie

22:07.369 --> 22:08.936
so soon after his death.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.679
Wait a second...

22:12.809 --> 22:14.724
where did you tell them you
were the night of the murder?

22:19.555 --> 22:21.383
I told them I was with you.

22:21.514 --> 22:22.515
But I was working!

22:52.414 --> 22:54.460
I still feel Dad's
presence in here.

22:57.071 --> 22:58.986
I do too.

23:05.558 --> 23:07.603
Why didn't you take Tim's call?

23:07.734 --> 23:09.039
I'm just not ready
to talk to anyone

23:09.170 --> 23:11.607
who was close to your dad.

23:11.738 --> 23:14.610
Well, you'll have
to soon enough.

23:14.741 --> 23:16.612
The funeral will come up fast.

23:16.743 --> 23:18.309
<i>You've reached Mila Gibson.</i>

23:18.440 --> 23:20.442
<i>Leave me a message and</i><i>
I'll call you back.</i>

23:20.573 --> 23:23.706
Mila we really need to talk.

23:23.837 --> 23:27.275
The police want to question
me first thing tomorrow.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.408
OK, this is urgent.
Please call me back.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.629
<i>Mila? I</i><i>
don't understand.</i>

23:33.760 --> 23:35.501
First you stopped
talking to Melody

23:35.631 --> 23:38.199
Now you're ignoring Tim?

23:38.329 --> 23:39.766
If you don't call
him back, I will.

23:44.814 --> 23:45.946
We have to talk about Tim.

23:52.605 --> 23:53.693
Melody!

23:53.823 --> 23:55.825
I'm sorry!

23:55.956 --> 23:58.611
I should have called to
tell you I was coming.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.395
I'm just looking
for my family album.

24:00.526 --> 24:02.789
It seems like you're
just making up reasons

24:02.919 --> 24:04.094
to come back here again!

24:04.225 --> 24:05.531
All of my stuff is here.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.010
I can't take
everything to Betty's.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.056
She's been nice enough to
let me stay at her place

24:09.186 --> 24:09.883
while she's traveling

24:11.928 --> 24:13.539
so it'll just will
have to be this way

24:13.669 --> 24:14.540
until we sell the house.

24:24.550 --> 24:27.161
It's so hard to believe that
Melody could have taken

24:27.291 --> 24:29.642
everything from
Tim in the divorce.

24:29.772 --> 24:31.687
I mean, it's so not like her.

24:31.818 --> 24:35.778
I know... but Tim was
left with almost nothing.

24:35.909 --> 24:39.390
He wasn't able to pay his part
of the firm for almost a year.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.828
Your father took
care of all of it.

24:41.958 --> 24:44.395
Tim owes him a lot of money;

24:44.526 --> 24:47.355
that's why he's so stressed
to talk to the police.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.706
Wait. Tim thinks they could
suspect him for Dad's murder

24:50.837 --> 24:53.927
because he owes him some
money? That's crazy!

24:56.930 --> 24:58.105
Wait! You don't think that...

24:58.235 --> 25:00.455
All I know for sure
is that I am not ready

25:00.586 --> 25:02.326
to have a discussion
with him at the moment.

25:02.457 --> 25:05.025
I understand that but...
Just because you're not ready

25:05.155 --> 25:06.809
doesn't mean I
can't talk to him.

25:08.245 --> 25:09.812
You're absolutely right.

25:09.943 --> 25:12.119
But it would give me more
reassurance if you did it

25:12.249 --> 25:14.556
somewhere public or at
least over the phone.

25:14.687 --> 25:17.690
Seriously, Mila?
He's my godfather.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.605
We've known him forever.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.520
I think you're being
slightly dramatic.

25:32.574 --> 25:35.577
Yes. I understand. I
should have told the truth

25:35.708 --> 25:37.536
right from the
start, Detective.

25:43.672 --> 25:44.847
I can't believe this.

25:46.414 --> 25:50.374
I mean, actually being
suspected of my ex's murder.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.855
This is way better than if
they found out on their own

25:52.986 --> 25:54.727
that you weren't with me
the night of Jack's murder.

25:56.946 --> 26:00.602
Hey. You're a good person.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.778
The only thing you're guilty
of is loving your daughter

26:02.909 --> 26:04.780
and wanting to
reconnect with her.

26:07.435 --> 26:08.741
That's my biggest wish.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.279
Hi.

26:25.409 --> 26:26.193
Hey, Matt.

26:27.107 --> 26:29.022
Uhh... Hi!

26:32.199 --> 26:33.983
Your mom didn't tell you we
were coming over for dinner?

26:34.114 --> 26:36.986
No.

26:37.117 --> 26:40.337
Um, I picked up your
favorite: apple crumble.

26:43.776 --> 26:46.300
OK. Maybe you
two need to talk.

26:49.303 --> 26:50.347
Matt?

26:50.478 --> 26:51.871
I can't do this.

26:53.786 --> 26:54.917
Wha?

26:59.705 --> 27:01.532
- Hey!
- Hey!

27:01.663 --> 27:02.795
I brought pie.

27:02.925 --> 27:04.187
Aw! You didn't have
to bring anything.

27:04.318 --> 27:05.972
I don't mind.

27:07.147 --> 27:07.713
How are you?

27:09.236 --> 27:10.106
I'm OK.

27:11.107 --> 27:12.195
Matt!

27:12.326 --> 27:13.283
What's going on?

27:15.024 --> 27:18.158
It's not that easy. I
don't know where to start.

27:18.288 --> 27:19.072
You're scaring me.

27:21.117 --> 27:23.598
You remember that... that
night that you were supposed

27:23.729 --> 27:25.644
to meet me at the movies
but then you didn't

27:25.774 --> 27:27.297
because you were getting
drunk with your friend?

27:27.428 --> 27:29.865
Yeah, I do. And
I'm really sorry.

27:29.996 --> 27:31.214
When I realized that you
wouldn't be joining me,

27:32.955 --> 27:34.827
I decided to come
home and that's...

27:34.957 --> 27:36.002
that's when I saw it.

27:38.569 --> 27:41.007
My dad was away at the cabin.

27:41.137 --> 27:42.182
Your mom was cheating?

27:43.966 --> 27:45.402
Did you recognize the guy?

27:48.884 --> 27:49.972
Yes. I did.

27:55.848 --> 27:57.023
It was Jack.

28:03.943 --> 28:08.077
No! No! No, my dad loved
Mila! He would never.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.731
I wouldn't have
believed it myself,

28:09.862 --> 28:11.690
except for that I saw them.

28:13.300 --> 28:18.305
So your mom and my dad
were having an affair?

28:20.350 --> 28:22.918
Does anybody else
know about this?

28:23.049 --> 28:25.312
My dad, when he came
back from the cabin,

28:25.442 --> 28:27.314
he heard me and my
mom fighting about it.

28:27.444 --> 28:28.837
That's how he found out.

28:31.361 --> 28:33.059
He must have been
really mad at my dad.

28:33.189 --> 28:36.192
Did he confront him?

28:36.323 --> 28:38.629
Not that I know of.

28:38.760 --> 28:39.848
Where is Harry tonight?

28:42.068 --> 28:46.072
He's away at the cabin. I think
he'll be there for a while.

28:46.202 --> 28:47.247
When did he leave?

28:47.377 --> 28:49.162
Charlie, where are
you going with this?

28:49.292 --> 28:51.120
I don't know!

28:51.251 --> 28:53.993
My dad's a cheater.
Someone killed him!

28:54.123 --> 28:55.646
And Mila's inside
having a good time

28:55.777 --> 28:57.518
with her dead
husband's mistress!

28:57.648 --> 28:59.085
She's gonna be destroyed
when she finds out.

28:59.215 --> 29:00.303
You want to tell her?

29:00.434 --> 29:03.089
I don't want to do
anything! But I have to.

29:03.219 --> 29:04.568
She thinks Rebecca's her friend.

29:04.699 --> 29:06.353
She can't be the only
one kept in the dark.

29:09.878 --> 29:12.054
There is no way I can
sit through this dinner

29:12.185 --> 29:13.447
with your mom.

29:16.058 --> 29:17.103
<i>Thank you so</i><i>
much for this.</i>

29:17.233 --> 29:18.191
Of course.

29:20.846 --> 29:23.109
Did you get any news
from the detective?

29:23.239 --> 29:25.154
<i>Nothing concrete.</i>

29:25.285 --> 29:27.766
They're questioning
all possible suspects.

29:29.680 --> 29:33.336
And uh, did you get any
more of those texts?

29:35.643 --> 29:37.253
I got one this morning.

29:38.515 --> 29:41.518
Saying that my time is coming
faster than I can imagine.

29:41.649 --> 29:43.782
I mean... the police
are working on it.

29:45.479 --> 29:49.048
It's just...

29:49.178 --> 29:52.094
it's just unbearable. You know,
it's only been two days and...

29:54.314 --> 29:56.055
God, I just miss him so much.

29:58.579 --> 29:59.928
I'm here for you, OK?

30:01.974 --> 30:02.539
Thank you.

30:06.065 --> 30:08.284
She makes me sick.

30:08.415 --> 30:10.417
What were you saying, sweetie?

30:10.547 --> 30:11.984
I said, I feel sick.

30:14.029 --> 30:16.466
Charlie, what is it?

30:16.597 --> 30:19.818
I just um... I don't feel
well all of a sudden.

30:22.124 --> 30:22.995
I want to go home.

30:25.258 --> 30:27.869
I'm so sorry. She's been
under a lot of stress.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.003
Don't worry at all, Mila. It's
completely understandable.

30:31.133 --> 30:32.918
Thank you. You
have a good night.

30:33.048 --> 30:33.353
You too.

30:33.483 --> 30:34.441
OK.

30:38.749 --> 30:42.014
All right, well, I guess it's
just the two of us tonight then.

30:45.582 --> 30:50.065
I get now why Dad
went to the cabin.

30:50.196 --> 30:52.589
I bet he wouldn't want to watch
you putting on your little show,

30:52.720 --> 30:55.027
pretending to be
Mila's perfect friend.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.117
You're so fake.

30:58.247 --> 30:59.335
Matthew!

31:01.424 --> 31:05.080
I'm not hungry. You
enjoy your dinner.

31:05.211 --> 31:09.345
And FYI, I told Charlie
your little secret,

31:09.476 --> 31:12.218
so it's only a matter of
time before Mila finds out.

31:23.272 --> 31:28.060
Matthew's 100 percent
sure of what he saw.

31:28.190 --> 31:30.889
He confronted Rebecca the
night he caught them together.

31:33.239 --> 31:34.066
I'm sorry.

31:36.329 --> 31:37.460
You know, it's
hurtful to think

31:37.591 --> 31:38.809
that Jack would do
something like that.

31:38.940 --> 31:42.683
But this is not how I
want you to remember him.

31:42.813 --> 31:45.381
He loved you more than anything.

31:45.512 --> 31:50.996
I don't doubt how much he
loved me; I'm just...

31:51.126 --> 31:54.086
I'm so mad at Rebecca.

31:54.216 --> 31:57.872
She's freaking playing the best
friend part with you!

31:58.003 --> 32:01.006
Bringing us lasagna, calling
dad's friends to help you.

32:01.136 --> 32:02.790
And then, and then she
invites us over for dinner,

32:02.921 --> 32:05.271
like she did nothing wrong!

32:05.401 --> 32:07.795
I just, I hate her so much!

32:17.326 --> 32:19.328
Do you think it would
make me a bad person

32:19.459 --> 32:22.505
if I wanna get to know
my biological mom?

32:22.636 --> 32:26.509
No. Why would you?

32:26.640 --> 32:28.468
I don't know...

32:28.598 --> 32:32.341
Just this whole thing with your
mom and my dad having an affair

32:32.472 --> 32:35.562
made me feel like maybe
I didn't know my dad

32:35.692 --> 32:40.175
as much as I thought I did...
or at least a side of him.

32:40.306 --> 32:42.569
Alyssa's known him
for long enough.

32:42.699 --> 32:44.310
Maybe she could
help me get to know

32:44.440 --> 32:47.052
the kind of man that he was.

32:47.182 --> 32:49.750
From what you told me,

32:49.880 --> 32:52.274
I'm not sure that Alyssa's
the right person for that.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.973
Plus, she's a stranger to you so
God knows what she could make up

32:55.103 --> 32:56.061
to get on your good side.

33:02.632 --> 33:03.982
How was school?

33:05.635 --> 33:06.854
Fine.

33:10.553 --> 33:11.685
Charlie?

33:22.652 --> 33:24.567
Detective Faulkner.
How can I help you?

33:24.698 --> 33:25.568
May I come in?

33:25.699 --> 33:26.613
Yes, of course.

33:29.920 --> 33:32.053
Do you know more about
what happened to my dad?

33:32.184 --> 33:35.970
I'd like to speak with your
step-mom privately if that's OK.

33:36.101 --> 33:40.148
What? No! If it's about my dad,
then I should be here too.

33:40.279 --> 33:41.584
Whatever she has to say to you

33:41.715 --> 33:43.412
she can say in
front of me, right?

33:43.543 --> 33:47.503
Yes, of course. Detective, I'm
OK with Charlie being here.

33:47.634 --> 33:49.418
Uh, what news do you have?

33:49.549 --> 33:53.031
No news, unfortunately
but I'll cut to the chase:

33:53.161 --> 33:55.685
why did you fail to mention
that you filed for divorce

33:55.816 --> 33:57.600
one month before
Jack was killed?

34:03.258 --> 34:05.565
Is she lying?

34:05.695 --> 34:08.611
You didn't actually plan on
getting divorced, did you?

34:10.222 --> 34:11.310
Mila?

34:12.789 --> 34:14.661
Baby, it's complicated.

34:14.791 --> 34:17.142
Yes, I went to the courthouse,
and I got the papers but--

34:17.272 --> 34:17.620
Charlie!

34:22.364 --> 34:23.757
Mrs. Gibson. Let's
go and talk,

34:23.887 --> 34:26.499
shall we?
- Yes.

34:26.629 --> 34:29.937
Why did you never
mention the divorce?

34:30.068 --> 34:33.810
I didn't think
it was relevant.

34:33.941 --> 34:36.161
Jack and I were going
through troubles.

34:36.291 --> 34:37.249
What kind of troubles?

34:39.468 --> 34:43.646
Jack was cheating... more
than once over the years.

34:43.777 --> 34:47.346
I understand. But you
must know how this looks.

34:50.262 --> 34:52.612
I never meant to hide
anything, I swear.

34:52.742 --> 34:58.052
Mrs. Gibson. You filed for
divorce and next thing you know,

34:58.183 --> 35:00.707
he turns up dead.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.187
So what are you saying?

35:02.317 --> 35:04.058
You think I had something
to do with his murder?

35:04.189 --> 35:07.888
The victim's partner is
always considered a suspect.

35:08.018 --> 35:10.412
We'll keep investigating
every angle,

35:10.543 --> 35:14.503
but it complicates things that
Jack is not here to corroborate

35:14.634 --> 35:17.027
your story or alibi
the night he died.

35:17.158 --> 35:18.855
You know, I hope that you
take into consideration

35:18.986 --> 35:21.075
that I'm the one receiving
the threatening texts.

35:21.206 --> 35:24.731
Yes, we are. And I
have a team of experts

35:24.861 --> 35:27.342
trying to track down
where the texts are coming from

35:27.473 --> 35:29.388
and a police car
parked out front.

35:31.912 --> 35:33.305
I think we're done here.

35:35.176 --> 35:36.873
<i>Hi, it's Melody.</i><i>
Leave me a message!</i>

35:37.004 --> 35:43.053
Hey, um. It's me.

35:43.184 --> 35:46.231
There's so much
going on here and...

35:46.361 --> 35:48.624
I don't know what to do.

35:48.755 --> 35:51.061
I need your advice.

35:51.192 --> 35:54.674
Just um, call me when
you get this. OK.

36:04.074 --> 36:05.554
I don't have anything
to say to you.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.208
Your father and I
were having issues,

36:07.339 --> 36:08.862
but we were trying
to work through it.

36:08.992 --> 36:11.256
The papers were never signed.

36:11.386 --> 36:12.866
I didn't want you to
find out like this.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.217
Come in.

36:18.915 --> 36:20.961
Sweetie.

36:21.091 --> 36:24.312
Please don't think that I didn't
love your dad because I did.

36:24.443 --> 36:25.618
I still do.

36:25.748 --> 36:28.490
I know you loved him.

36:28.621 --> 36:31.754
I heard some of the
conversation from downstairs.

36:31.885 --> 36:33.539
You're in trouble with
the police, right?

36:36.455 --> 36:39.632
Kind of. But they're
just doing their job.

36:39.762 --> 36:43.897
They just have to investigate
every possible angle.

36:44.027 --> 36:46.204
Alyssa Price? Your mother?

36:46.334 --> 36:47.727
She came by yesterday.

36:50.512 --> 36:53.950
She said that she wants me to
hear her side of the story...

36:54.081 --> 36:56.214
like when I'm ready.

36:56.344 --> 36:59.304
Your dad said she would never
try and get in touch with you.

36:59.434 --> 37:00.740
She's an addict.

37:03.786 --> 37:08.095
What, are you gonna give her
a chance to explain herself?

37:08.226 --> 37:12.491
Probably. I mean, her story
is kinda like my story too

37:12.621 --> 37:14.580
in a way. so I
guess at some point,

37:14.710 --> 37:17.409
I might wanna hear
what she has to say.

37:17.539 --> 37:20.455
I get it. And I want you
to know that I support

37:20.586 --> 37:24.633
whatever you decide.
Just be careful.

37:24.764 --> 37:28.768
Her reappearing right after
Jack's death, it's...

37:28.898 --> 37:30.813
it's questionable for me.

37:30.944 --> 37:32.380
No, I get it.

37:43.478 --> 37:45.785
Is Dad's affair with Rebecca
the reason you decided

37:45.915 --> 37:46.960
to file for divorce?

37:49.963 --> 37:54.272
No, I didn't know.
I told you that.

37:54.402 --> 37:55.273
Then why?

37:57.187 --> 37:59.407
I wanted to divorce your dad
because he was a...

38:02.541 --> 38:05.892
He cheated on me more than once.

38:06.022 --> 38:09.330
And when I found out about the
most recent affair, months ago,

38:09.461 --> 38:10.984
I just decided
enough was enough.

38:16.772 --> 38:19.471
I didn't want it to
have to come here,

38:19.601 --> 38:21.516
but eventually, the
rumors would get to you,

38:21.647 --> 38:23.257
and I would prefer
you hear it from me.

38:27.827 --> 38:29.437
Your dad was having an
affair with Melody--

38:29.568 --> 38:34.921
Wha! with my
godmother? Seriously?

38:35.051 --> 38:37.010
It's you I'm starting
to doubt now.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.578
You want me to remember the
good things about my dad?

38:39.708 --> 38:42.494
But you're describing
him as a serial cheater.

38:42.624 --> 38:45.323
And why are you always talking
so badly about Melody?

38:45.453 --> 38:47.542
Are you jealous of my
relationship with her?

38:47.673 --> 38:50.458
Just ask Tim, he's the one that
found out. He'll tell you!

38:50.589 --> 38:51.764
Leave me alone!

39:07.475 --> 39:09.912
<i>This is the voicemail of Tim</i><i>
Robertson, attorney at law.</i>

39:10.043 --> 39:11.958
<i>I'm not available to</i><i>
take your call right now.</i>

39:12.088 --> 39:13.829
<i>Please leave your name and</i><i>
number so we can schedule</i>

39:13.960 --> 39:15.135
<i>a time to speak. Thank you.</i>

39:15.265 --> 39:20.923
Hey Tim, it's
me, um... Charlie.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.752
Uh, let me know if you're
free sometime tomorrow.

39:23.883 --> 39:27.539
I have some questions I need
to ask you. Thanks. Bye.

39:32.718 --> 39:34.720
Oh, my God! Jack and Melody?

39:34.850 --> 39:37.070
It's a lot! I really
don't know what to think!

39:37.200 --> 39:38.550
I'm meeting with Tim
this afternoon.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.073
So I'll see what he
has to say.

39:43.119 --> 39:46.732
Jack was the perfect
father to you.

39:46.862 --> 39:48.647
Would it really matter if he
wasn't the perfect husband

39:48.777 --> 39:50.518
or the perfect friend?

39:50.649 --> 39:54.870
Possibly. Maybe Alyssa
isn't fully to blame

39:55.001 --> 39:56.524
for ending up like how she did.

39:57.830 --> 39:59.919
Agh! Melody is calling me.

40:00.049 --> 40:01.703
I don't wanna talk
to her right now.

40:01.834 --> 40:06.055
So don't answer. Hey, are you
sure you're not going to school?

40:06.186 --> 40:09.624
Positive! I'm gonna enjoy
having the house to myself.

40:09.755 --> 40:11.278
<i>I'm gonna try and</i><i>
go back to sleep.</i>

40:11.409 --> 40:12.932
Fine. Byeee.

40:13.062 --> 40:14.020
Byee.

40:33.561 --> 40:34.867
Officer Ferguson speaking.

40:34.997 --> 40:36.651
<i>Ferguson, Faulkner here.</i>

40:36.782 --> 40:39.349
<i>I have an emergency
at 544 Lane Street.</i>

40:39.480 --> 40:41.003
<i>I need you to head
there right away.</i>

40:41.134 --> 40:43.049
<i>I'll send someone else to
watch the Gibson house.</i>

40:43.179 --> 40:44.442
Copy that, Detective.

42:05.174 --> 42:07.089
Police are gone.

43:39.051 --> 43:40.487
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

43:45.144 --> 43:47.712
We are so very sorry
for what has happened.

43:49.496 --> 43:53.152
Officer Ferguson should
have never left his guard.

43:53.282 --> 43:55.110
He said you called
him with an emergency.

43:55.241 --> 43:56.895
Yes, but I didn't.

43:57.025 --> 43:58.984
Looks like we're
facing another AI call.

43:59.114 --> 44:01.595
This time they used my voice.

44:01.726 --> 44:05.947
The person that we're looking
for has access to my voice.

44:06.078 --> 44:08.994
Probably someone I
interrogated in Jack's case.

44:10.952 --> 44:13.825
From now on, everyone
is a suspect.

44:16.958 --> 44:21.267
I will make it a priority
to check everyone's alibi.

44:21.397 --> 44:24.009
I'll be starting
with you, Mrs Gibson.

44:25.967 --> 44:27.665
Charlie, if you can excuse us.

44:40.547 --> 44:43.724
Where were you this morning?

44:43.855 --> 44:46.161
I had an appointment
with my therapist.

45:00.872 --> 45:02.047
Daddy?

45:04.571 --> 45:08.836
I don't know what
to do.

45:08.967 --> 45:10.229
I need your help.

45:13.188 --> 45:14.973
Please come back.

45:29.814 --> 45:31.076
Hello, Detective.

45:32.991 --> 45:35.733
Uh, yeah, I can come by to
visit you at the station.

45:37.560 --> 45:40.172
OK. I'll see you soon. Bye bye.

45:43.871 --> 45:45.873
I was at my friend's house.

45:46.004 --> 45:48.833
I've been staying with her ever
since we filed for divorce.

45:48.963 --> 45:52.271
And why are you here
at your ex's now?

45:54.055 --> 45:56.623
All my stuff is here.

45:56.754 --> 45:59.060
I'll need to talk
to your friend.

45:59.191 --> 46:02.977
Uhh... she's traveling in Europe.

46:03.108 --> 46:06.589
Can anyone confirm your
whereabouts for this morning?

46:06.720 --> 46:08.330
What do you want me to tell you?

46:08.461 --> 46:10.506
I've been here all day
working on these files.

46:10.637 --> 46:13.161
No phone calls? No visitors?

46:13.292 --> 46:15.294
No. I've been here and
turned off my phone

46:15.424 --> 46:16.861
to focus on my work.

46:16.991 --> 46:18.906
I was helping with
inventory at the bistro.

46:19.037 --> 46:20.386
I've been here since 8:30.

46:20.908 --> 46:24.216
My sister, Olivia Price and
her colleague Dianne Hoeve,

46:24.346 --> 46:25.304
they an confirm.

46:30.570 --> 46:33.965
I just finished the interviews
with the top suspects,

46:34.095 --> 46:35.749
but nothing conclusive so far.

46:45.890 --> 46:47.282
- Hey, kiddo!
- Hey, Tim.

46:47.413 --> 46:53.288
Charlie. I... I didn't
know you were coming.

46:53.419 --> 46:55.682
My sister works here. I
sometimes stay for breakfast

46:55.813 --> 46:57.815
or lunch. She's right
over there.

47:00.513 --> 47:03.385
Well, you were here before
me, so it's not like

47:03.516 --> 47:05.344
you followed me or
anything this time.

47:12.003 --> 47:14.179
OK. Well. Have a good lunch.

47:14.309 --> 47:15.484
Thank you.

47:15.615 --> 47:16.921
It was good to see you.

47:24.885 --> 47:30.325
Alyssa... I'm still thinking
things through and...

47:30.456 --> 47:35.940
I'm not there yet but um,
I'll be in touch, you know,

47:36.070 --> 47:37.855
when I wanna hear
your side of things.

47:39.552 --> 47:40.379
That sounds perfect.

47:43.556 --> 47:45.123
See ya.

47:46.602 --> 47:47.516
It's good to see you!

47:47.647 --> 47:49.040
It's good to see you too.

47:55.742 --> 47:57.918
I didn't know you
still talk to Alyssa.

47:58.049 --> 47:59.833
Oh no, I haven't
seen her in years!

47:59.964 --> 48:02.967
I just found out that she moved
back to town two months ago.

48:03.097 --> 48:05.795
Yeah, I know.

48:05.926 --> 48:09.495
She um, came by my
house on Sunday.

48:09.625 --> 48:12.759
That's one of the things I want
to discuss with you, actually.

48:14.935 --> 48:18.025
Everything I know about
Alyssa comes from my dad

48:18.156 --> 48:21.811
and he didn't have a very
high opinion about her.

48:21.942 --> 48:25.815
So I guess what
I'm asking is...

48:25.946 --> 48:28.079
do you have that same
opinion about her?

48:30.646 --> 48:34.694
Listen, Alyssa
had her dark days.

48:34.824 --> 48:38.393
She made some bad decisions
that didn't help her situation.

48:38.524 --> 48:40.265
That almost sounds sad.

48:40.395 --> 48:41.831
It is.

48:41.962 --> 48:43.616
Alyssa's a good person.

48:43.746 --> 48:45.270
She just took a wrong path.

48:47.881 --> 48:50.579
Look. You have Jack's version

48:50.710 --> 48:53.365
and you're mature enough
to hear Alyssa's side.

48:53.495 --> 48:55.541
And then you can form your
own opinion of what happened.

48:58.674 --> 49:02.200
So you think I should have
that little chat with her?

49:02.330 --> 49:06.465
I do. I trust your
judgement, honey.

49:09.511 --> 49:12.950
So what else did you
want to discuss with me?

49:13.080 --> 49:16.301
Um... I'll make this quick.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.961
Is it true that my dad
and Melody had an affair?

49:28.095 --> 49:29.967
Mila told you?

49:35.581 --> 49:38.236
Yes. It really happened.

49:40.499 --> 49:42.892
If you'll excuse me,

49:43.023 --> 49:44.329
I just need to use
the men's room.

49:58.430 --> 50:01.259
"We really need a talk.
Stop avoiding me?"

50:35.380 --> 50:36.816
Hey!

50:36.946 --> 50:38.078
Charlie! I think
someone was following me.

50:38.209 --> 50:39.558
What!

50:41.168 --> 50:42.561
Are they still there?

50:42.691 --> 50:44.998
No. A car pulled into
the parking lot.

50:45.129 --> 50:47.131
<i>I think the car</i><i>
lights spooked them.</i>

50:47.261 --> 50:48.349
Did they see who it was?

50:48.480 --> 50:49.785
No.

50:49.916 --> 50:50.786
Have you called the police?

50:51.135 --> 50:52.223
<i>The guy did.</i>

50:52.353 --> 50:54.094
He's still on the
phone with them. I...

50:54.225 --> 50:55.791
I just wanted to
call you right away

50:55.922 --> 50:57.793
to make sure you were safe.

50:57.924 --> 51:00.100
I'm glad you're OK.

51:00.231 --> 51:02.581
<i>Um... just...</i>

51:02.711 --> 51:04.235
Call me when the
police get there.

51:05.584 --> 51:06.150
I will.

51:07.934 --> 51:11.242
I'm sorry for
calling you so late.

51:11.372 --> 51:14.723
The detective didn't want Mila
and I to be alone in the house

51:14.854 --> 51:16.725
She's so exhausted and...

51:16.856 --> 51:18.640
I don't feel safe since--

51:18.771 --> 51:20.512
It's OK, honey.

51:20.642 --> 51:21.687
I'm here now.

51:23.689 --> 51:27.084
You should try to get some rest
and I'll watch over Mila, yeah?

51:27.214 --> 51:28.607
OK.

51:43.361 --> 51:45.232
What are you doing here?

51:45.363 --> 51:48.279
Charlie called me. I've
been here all night.

51:52.631 --> 51:54.981
I agree with you,
we need to talk.

51:55.242 --> 51:57.636
Yes, we do, but not now.

51:57.766 --> 51:59.464
I don't want Charlie
hearing any of this.

51:59.594 --> 52:00.639
You need to get out of here.

52:00.769 --> 52:02.075
Mila--

52:02.206 --> 52:06.688
Tim. Please. For
Charlie's sake? Leave.

52:06.819 --> 52:09.126
You make sure to call me
the second Charlie leaves.

52:15.523 --> 52:17.351
What was that about?

52:17.482 --> 52:19.048
What don't you want me to hear?

52:20.354 --> 52:21.442
It's nothing.

52:21.877 --> 52:23.444
Oh, my God, I know it's
not nothing! Tell me!

52:24.837 --> 52:27.318
I am so sick of all the
lies and the secrets!

52:38.677 --> 52:39.504
Hello?

52:41.288 --> 52:44.378
It's um, Charlie.

52:44.509 --> 52:48.861
Hi. Charlie, what's going on?

52:48.991 --> 52:52.169
I'm ready to talk.

52:57.478 --> 53:00.873
Mila's hidden so
many things from me.

53:01.003 --> 53:03.789
I'm sure she had her reasons.

53:03.919 --> 53:06.400
You guys need an
honest conversation.

53:06.531 --> 53:12.580
Yeah. But, even then,
I don't even know

53:12.711 --> 53:15.931
if I would be able to
believe what she has to say.

53:16.062 --> 53:18.064
You won't know unless you try.

53:25.114 --> 53:26.725
Do you have any plans right now?

53:28.901 --> 53:31.120
Not really.

53:31.251 --> 53:33.732
Would you like to
go to lunch with me?

53:37.605 --> 53:38.737
Sure!

53:42.784 --> 53:44.743
Can I hug you?

53:44.873 --> 53:46.788
of course!

54:01.150 --> 54:04.763
<i>Don't worry, I'm with Alyssa.</i><i>
Hope you're feeling better."</i>

54:07.200 --> 54:08.810
<i>Hey! You've reached Charlie...</i>

54:19.734 --> 54:21.867
So, you still
haven't told her yet

54:21.997 --> 54:24.391
why you two were
separated for so long?

54:24.522 --> 54:26.828
No. She has enough on her plate.

54:26.959 --> 54:28.787
I prefer to let
her set the pace.

54:32.138 --> 54:37.622
I do have questions, but
we can't change the past.

54:40.451 --> 54:42.279
Don't you think
knowing more about it

54:42.409 --> 54:43.802
could help you understand?

54:52.724 --> 54:54.465
I'm ready to hear everything.

54:57.511 --> 55:02.995
Before I start... I
want you to know that...

55:03.125 --> 55:05.258
I think Jack was a
wonderful father.

55:08.827 --> 55:14.833
But uh ...he... he
was a chronic cheater.

55:14.963 --> 55:18.097
It was as if he
couldn't help it.

55:18.227 --> 55:20.839
And... you were an addict.

55:20.969 --> 55:23.755
Yes. I drank.

55:23.885 --> 55:28.368
I wasn't happy and
I wanted a divorce,

55:28.499 --> 55:34.505
but I was terrified that if
I left Jack, he would...

55:34.635 --> 55:36.333
try to take you from me.

55:38.900 --> 55:44.123
So I turned to alcohol and,
when I was deep enough,

55:44.253 --> 55:45.864
he filed the papers for divorce.

55:49.694 --> 55:52.174
He also asked
for full custody

55:52.305 --> 55:56.091
since he was able to prove
that I was an alcoholic.

55:56.222 --> 56:00.574
But you were still
allowed to see me after.

56:00.705 --> 56:04.535
I was... until, one day I...

56:07.538 --> 56:09.670
I drank and drove
with you in the car

56:09.801 --> 56:12.369
and got into a car accident.

56:12.499 --> 56:14.675
How bad was the accident?

56:14.806 --> 56:16.460
I crashed into another car.

56:16.590 --> 56:18.287
Thankfully it was
in a parking lot,

56:18.418 --> 56:21.508
so no one was speeding
and no one got hurt.

56:21.639 --> 56:24.206
Is that why you weren't
allowed to see me anymore?

56:24.337 --> 56:28.428
That's right. I could
barely live with myself

56:28.559 --> 56:32.693
knowing that I
put you in danger.

56:32.824 --> 56:37.742
So I started drinking even
more than I was before.

56:37.872 --> 56:43.922
We got divorced; Jack had my
visitation rights revoked.

56:44.052 --> 56:48.753
I wasn't in a good place.

56:48.883 --> 56:53.105
I spiraled
out of control.

56:53.235 --> 56:56.064
But Olivia saved me.

56:56.195 --> 56:58.153
I got my life on track,

56:58.284 --> 57:00.939
and I counted down the
days to your 16th birthday.

57:04.333 --> 57:10.035
I've missed so much of
your life...

57:10.165 --> 57:12.298
It's my biggest regret.

57:15.170 --> 57:17.521
I'm so sorry, Charlie.

58:14.447 --> 58:17.972
Mila. I wasn't expecting you...

58:18.103 --> 58:21.062
especially since you kicked me
out of your house yesterday.

58:21.193 --> 58:23.151
You know we couldn't talk
in front of Charlie...

58:23.282 --> 58:24.979
or when Melody's at your house.

58:25.110 --> 58:27.591
She's grabbing some more stuff.

58:27.721 --> 58:29.462
She's in the garage
now, though. We're good.

58:38.210 --> 58:40.386
I drove past your
house yesterday.

58:40.517 --> 58:42.431
I saw Melody's car
in the driveway.

58:42.562 --> 58:43.824
I almost thought you
guys got back together.

58:43.955 --> 58:46.131
What? No!

58:46.261 --> 58:48.786
No, it seems like every day she
finds a new reason to stop by.

58:48.916 --> 58:50.178
Stop pretending, Tim!

58:50.309 --> 58:51.702
I know you killed Jack!

58:51.832 --> 58:53.965
And that was not
part of our plan!

58:54.095 --> 58:55.662
You cannot be serious.

58:55.793 --> 58:58.317
I came to you for help; you
said you were working on it.

58:58.447 --> 59:02.756
Wow! Now he's cheating
with Rebecca too, huh?

59:02.887 --> 59:04.845
I don't know why I'm
not really surprised.

59:04.976 --> 59:08.022
I didn't come here for your
opinions on my marriage.

59:08.153 --> 59:09.807
I filed for divorce.

59:09.937 --> 59:11.548
Yeah. It's about time!

59:13.419 --> 59:15.552
Jack
won't sign the papers.

59:15.682 --> 59:19.773
Exactly. Tim, I need your help.

59:19.904 --> 59:23.516
I can't live like this. Jack
needs to agree to signing.

59:29.043 --> 59:31.437
I know exactly what to do.

59:31.568 --> 59:34.353
I just need some
time but trust me,

59:34.483 --> 59:36.355
Jack won't be a problem anymore.

59:36.485 --> 59:39.184
I never thought that would
mean you murdering Jack!

59:43.580 --> 59:44.798
Are you crazy?

59:45.538 --> 59:47.322
I did have a plan, but it was
certainly not to kill him!

59:47.453 --> 59:49.324
Come on, Mila! Jack
was my best friend!

59:49.455 --> 59:52.066
A friend that ruined
your marriage.

59:52.197 --> 59:55.113
Admit it. You're the only one
that benefits from his death.

59:57.115 --> 59:58.899
I am tired of hiding the truth.

01:00:00.466 --> 01:00:03.077
So I've decided to tell
the detective everything.

01:00:06.254 --> 01:00:08.909
If I were you, I would
keep my mouth shut.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.998
I have dirt on you, too.

01:00:11.129 --> 01:00:13.131
All the text
messages you sent me?

01:00:13.261 --> 01:00:16.351
About how you were so desperate
to have him outta your life?

01:00:16.482 --> 01:00:18.484
How you would do anything
to separate from him?

01:00:20.573 --> 01:00:21.792
You're using my
words against me!

01:00:21.922 --> 01:00:23.924
And that is not how I meant it!

01:00:24.055 --> 01:00:27.624
Well, it sure makes it look
like you wanted him dead.

01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:31.236
<i>Hey, Tim. You're</i><i>
taking way too much time.</i>

01:00:31.366 --> 01:00:33.717
<i>I don't want to wait any</i><i>
longer for the divorce.</i>

01:00:33.847 --> 01:00:38.417
<i>I found a way. I'll</i><i>
handle things by myself.</i>

01:00:38.547 --> 01:00:42.247
Yeah. Now that's from the
day before Jack got killed.

01:00:42.377 --> 01:00:46.251
I'm warning you, Mila, if you
ever try to bring me down,

01:00:46.381 --> 01:00:47.818
I'm dragging you with me.

01:00:50.168 --> 01:00:52.300
Now tell me that you'll
make the wise decision

01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:54.912
of driving straight home.

01:00:57.131 --> 01:00:59.394
You're a smart woman, Mila.

01:00:59.525 --> 01:01:01.614
Don't make the mistake of
talking to the police.

01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:48.879
<i>I came to you for help.</i>

01:01:49.009 --> 01:01:50.750
<i>You said you were working on it.</i>

01:01:50.881 --> 01:01:53.187
<i>I never thought that would</i><i>
mean you murdering Jack!</i>

01:01:53.318 --> 01:01:55.015
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

01:01:55.146 --> 01:01:57.844
<i>I did have a plan, but it was</i><i>
certainly not to kill him.</i>

01:01:57.975 --> 01:01:59.803
<i>Come on, Mila; Jack</i><i>
was my best friend.</i>

01:01:59.933 --> 01:02:02.501
<i>A friend who ruined</i><i>
your marriage.</i>

01:02:02.631 --> 01:02:06.200
<i>Admit it. You're the only one</i><i>
that benefits from his death.</i>

01:02:06.331 --> 01:02:09.029
Wh-what's Mila talking about?

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.553
Why-why did she need Tim's help.

01:02:11.684 --> 01:02:16.733
I... this is... unbearable
to say out loud but...

01:02:18.647 --> 01:02:23.522
I think... Tim killed your dad.

01:02:23.652 --> 01:02:27.613
And with the money that Tim
owes Jack and this recording...

01:02:29.397 --> 01:02:33.445
it's enough against him.

01:02:33.575 --> 01:02:35.621
I think we should go
to the police now.

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:47.111
<i>You left Mila with Tim?</i>

01:02:47.241 --> 01:02:48.852
You know she got all
those threatening texts

01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:51.855
and whoever killed my dad
wants to kill her too.

01:02:51.985 --> 01:02:54.901
I'm sorry. I was scared...

01:02:55.032 --> 01:02:57.208
and I just wanted to tell
you as soon as I heard.

01:02:59.036 --> 01:03:03.214
And I was hoping you might want
to come to the station with me.

01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:08.567
No, I think that's
too much for Charlie.

01:03:08.697 --> 01:03:11.048
I understand. I'll
just go on my own.

01:03:16.749 --> 01:03:18.969
Is everything's OK?

01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:20.318
I'd better head to
the station now.

01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:38.727
<i>Mila. I know it wasn't</i><i>
you who killed Jack.</i>

01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:41.774
<i>I found something that</i><i>
could exonerate us both.</i>

01:03:41.905 --> 01:03:43.167
<i>I'll explain everything later.</i>

01:04:03.143 --> 01:04:04.188
I don't understand. I
thought she'd be here.

01:04:15.503 --> 01:04:17.201
What are you doing?

01:04:17.331 --> 01:04:19.943
I'm looking for
some sort of record

01:04:20.073 --> 01:04:22.554
proving that Tim
owed my dad money...

01:04:22.684 --> 01:04:23.947
and then we can
go to the police.

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.085
Why would my dad have
an old flip phone?

01:04:32.216 --> 01:04:33.217
Let me see.

01:04:38.483 --> 01:04:40.398
No texts. No calls.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.236
Hey! Sorry I haven't called you.

01:04:52.366 --> 01:04:54.238
Matthew? It's not
important right now.

01:04:54.368 --> 01:04:56.153
Things are getting
even more crazy here.

01:04:56.283 --> 01:04:57.676
How come?

01:04:57.806 --> 01:05:00.592
Melody recorded Mila and
Tim. It seems like they

01:05:00.722 --> 01:05:04.378
were working together on some
sort of plot against my dad.

01:05:04.509 --> 01:05:06.554
Anyways.
Long story short,

01:05:06.685 --> 01:05:09.079
we think that Tim killed my dad.

01:05:09.209 --> 01:05:11.472
What? No!

01:05:11.603 --> 01:05:12.996
<i>I need your help.</i>

01:05:13.126 --> 01:05:16.738
I found an old burner
phone in my dad's stuff.

01:05:16.869 --> 01:05:20.307
How do I check if there's
any deleted messages on it?

01:05:20.438 --> 01:05:22.875
You have to find
the trash folder.

01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:25.965
Do you see a menu button?

01:05:26.096 --> 01:05:33.016
<i>Charlie? You see</i><i>
it? Charlie? Hello?</i>

01:05:34.104 --> 01:05:35.801
All the threatening messages
we got are on there.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.107
What!

01:05:37.237 --> 01:05:39.544
<i>What? Put me on speaker!</i>

01:05:39.674 --> 01:05:41.372
<i>Who else has access</i><i>
to your dad's office?</i>

01:05:41.502 --> 01:05:43.461
Just Mila and I.

01:05:43.591 --> 01:05:46.116
And Tim.

01:05:46.246 --> 01:05:49.206
He was with Mila the night
that she was followed, right?

01:06:36.688 --> 01:06:41.084
Oh! I see that you
got my messages.

01:06:47.177 --> 01:06:49.918
That was you...
that killed Jack?

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:53.879
And you tried to
frame me for it?

01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:59.450
I knew it was you...

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.278
when I found the gun.

01:07:03.802 --> 01:07:05.543
...in the garage
after you left.

01:07:05.673 --> 01:07:06.892
It wasn't there before.

01:07:07.893 --> 01:07:08.894
I'm sorry, Tim.

01:07:12.115 --> 01:07:14.247
I can't take any chances.

01:08:00.772 --> 01:08:03.079
You should never
have sent these texts, Tim!

01:08:08.301 --> 01:08:09.259
Is everything's OK?

01:08:13.393 --> 01:08:14.612
I'd better head to
the station now.

01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:31.455
Tim! It's Mila!

01:08:37.722 --> 01:08:40.986
Oh, Mila! You killed Tim, too.

01:08:42.683 --> 01:08:43.641
Gotta be here.

01:09:03.791 --> 01:09:04.662
Tim?

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.382
I'm just going in for
questioning, right?

01:10:12.512 --> 01:10:14.384
I don't get it. I'm
the one that called.

01:10:22.609 --> 01:10:24.916
I have already told
you everything!

01:10:25.046 --> 01:10:26.700
Tim called me because
he thought he knew

01:10:26.831 --> 01:10:28.267
who killed my husband.

01:10:28.398 --> 01:10:30.400
And Mr. Robertson
was already dead

01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:34.534
when you got there at 4:50?

01:10:34.665 --> 01:10:35.753
Yes.

01:10:51.421 --> 01:11:00.256
What? No. No, not
my husband!

01:11:12.964 --> 01:11:15.619
Faulkner speaking.

01:11:15.749 --> 01:11:17.142
OK. What was she doing?

01:11:19.057 --> 01:11:20.276
Are you done interrogating her?

01:11:23.627 --> 01:11:27.283
A recording of an argument with
the victim and Mrs. Gibson.

01:11:29.633 --> 01:11:30.808
OK.

01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:36.379
Forgetting to mention
important facts

01:11:36.509 --> 01:11:39.947
seems to be a recurring
thing for you, Mrs. Gibson.

01:11:40.078 --> 01:11:43.037
You and I have been
speaking for over an hour

01:11:43.168 --> 01:11:44.561
and you never thought to mention

01:11:46.476 --> 01:11:48.434
that you had an argument with
the victim this afternoon?

01:11:51.176 --> 01:11:52.830
I had just come back
from the police station

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.354
to drop off the recording

01:11:55.485 --> 01:11:57.269
when the police
showed up at my door.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.705
First Dad?

01:11:58.836 --> 01:12:00.577
And now Tim?

01:12:00.707 --> 01:12:03.754
All I know is that Mila
was the one who found him

01:12:03.884 --> 01:12:06.234
and she told them that he
was dead when she got there.

01:12:06.365 --> 01:12:08.541
But I mean, who knows
who's telling the truth

01:12:08.672 --> 01:12:11.544
after the argument they
had this afternoon?

01:12:11.675 --> 01:12:13.416
I thought that the
threatening texts

01:12:13.546 --> 01:12:15.505
could have been
from Tim, but now...

01:12:20.205 --> 01:12:22.642
I'm sure that they're from Mila.

01:12:22.773 --> 01:12:24.035
And it was some kind of coverup.

01:12:24.165 --> 01:12:26.603
And now It's all coming out.

01:12:26.733 --> 01:12:29.736
I just feel
so bad that I thought

01:12:29.867 --> 01:12:31.738
that Tim was behind all this.

01:12:31.869 --> 01:12:35.263
No! How could
Mila have done the AI?

01:12:35.394 --> 01:12:37.483
With Dad in the room?

01:12:37.614 --> 01:12:40.094
Oh, Honey! Honey, we don't...

01:12:40.225 --> 01:12:42.619
We don't know for sure
that she was home.

01:12:42.749 --> 01:12:46.492
Only your dad could've
confirmed that and...

01:12:46.623 --> 01:12:48.712
And he's gone too.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:55.283
<i>Do you want me to</i><i>
tell the police</i>

01:12:55.414 --> 01:12:56.676
about the burner phone?

01:12:56.807 --> 01:12:58.548
Yes. Yes, you should tell them.

01:13:03.117 --> 01:13:05.816
I'm really sorry about
Tim and everything, Melody

01:13:05.946 --> 01:13:08.906
but Charlie's really not well
right now. So just uh...

01:13:09.036 --> 01:13:10.298
come by when you're
done with the police.

01:13:10.429 --> 01:13:11.822
OK. Ok.

01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:53.864
Are you feeling any better?

01:13:53.994 --> 01:13:58.346
Yeah.

01:13:58.477 --> 01:14:00.218
Matthew called when
you were asleep.

01:14:00.348 --> 01:14:02.481
I put it on silent, so
it didn't wake you.

01:14:02.612 --> 01:14:03.569
Thanks.

01:14:09.009 --> 01:14:10.489
Gonna call Matthew.

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:11.708
Yeah.

01:14:13.579 --> 01:14:14.493
Take all the time you need.

01:14:14.624 --> 01:14:15.799
Thanks.

01:14:20.804 --> 01:14:24.677
<i>You're positive that Mila Gibson</i><i>
left her domicile at 4:20?</i>

01:14:24.808 --> 01:14:26.810
One hundred percent sure, Ma'am.

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:31.467
<i>OK. Over twenty miles</i><i>
separates the two residences.</i>

01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:33.686
<i>Mrs. Gibson couldn't</i><i>
have logically been</i>

01:14:33.817 --> 01:14:37.777
<i>at the victim's house</i><i>
earlier than 4:50.</i>

01:14:37.908 --> 01:14:40.388
<i>Everything suggests that Mr.</i><i>
Robertson was already dead</i>

01:14:40.519 --> 01:14:42.565
<i>when she arrived.</i>

01:14:42.695 --> 01:14:44.349
So you released her?

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.134
<i>Yes. For now. Let me know</i><i>
when she's arrived home.</i>

01:14:47.265 --> 01:14:48.571
<i>Don't go anywhere this time!</i>

01:14:48.701 --> 01:14:49.485
Copy that.

01:15:05.892 --> 01:15:11.985
I can't believe
he did that.

01:15:30.482 --> 01:15:31.918
Hey! Uh, anything new?

01:15:32.049 --> 01:15:33.616
Tim's dead!

01:15:33.746 --> 01:15:36.444
What? No way!

01:15:36.575 --> 01:15:39.099
Mila's the one who
found him, Matt.

01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:41.101
Do you think she killed him?

01:15:41.232 --> 01:15:44.757
Everything's against her...

01:15:44.888 --> 01:15:46.324
the burner,

01:15:46.454 --> 01:15:49.849
the recording of her and
Tim arguing and now this.

01:15:53.157 --> 01:15:57.422
But it's just like...

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.903
I can't believe that
she would do that.

01:16:03.689 --> 01:16:05.909
Am I stupid or am I blind?

01:16:06.039 --> 01:16:08.433
No! You love her.

01:16:13.786 --> 01:16:15.005
I think Melody's here.

01:16:15.135 --> 01:16:17.703
I'll call you back.

01:16:25.015 --> 01:16:32.022
I just
can't believe that Tim's dead.

01:16:32.152 --> 01:16:35.678
I know. I'm so sorry.

01:16:40.726 --> 01:16:42.554
It's so obvious to me now

01:16:42.685 --> 01:16:46.079
that Mila is the one who
killed him... and Jack.

01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:48.125
The recording I have is
pretty clear on the fact

01:16:48.255 --> 01:16:50.823
that she wanted to divorce
Jack no matter what the cost!

01:16:50.954 --> 01:16:56.089
This is um, really
hard on Charlie

01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:58.614
Let's just not talk about
it in front of her.

01:16:58.744 --> 01:17:00.050
Ah, yeah.

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:03.096
I don't want to be here
when Mila gets back.

01:17:03.227 --> 01:17:04.750
I'll go pack a bag.

01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:11.235
We should bring the burner
phone to the police.

01:17:11.365 --> 01:17:14.281
Let them do their jobs.

01:17:14.412 --> 01:17:17.110
Did they uh, did they
search the house yet?

01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:20.026
Um, I don't think so.

01:17:20.157 --> 01:17:22.072
I'm gonna bring this
outside to the officer.

01:17:33.344 --> 01:17:34.867
<i>OK. I'll be there soon!</i>

01:17:34.998 --> 01:17:36.739
<i>Just go with Alyssa; I'll</i><i>
pick you up at her place.</i>

01:17:36.869 --> 01:17:38.523
OK.

01:17:41.352 --> 01:17:42.962
OH NO! Mila's home!

01:17:43.093 --> 01:17:44.964
I can't handle seeing
her right now! I can't--

01:17:45.095 --> 01:17:46.357
Just breathe.

01:18:09.641 --> 01:18:10.860
Oh my God! Oh my!

01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:12.731
I've been blind?
This whole time?

01:18:12.862 --> 01:18:14.559
Alyssa! Charlie!
Help me! Help me!

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:16.213
Mila! Stop!

01:18:16.343 --> 01:18:19.607
Oh, my God! You're a monster!

01:18:19.738 --> 01:18:20.826
You killed my husband!

01:18:22.654 --> 01:18:27.964
Charlie. Listen to me, please.
Melody's trying to frame me!

01:18:28.094 --> 01:18:30.053
I know Dad and Melody
didn't have an affair.

01:18:30.183 --> 01:18:31.881
You lied to get
the divorce papers.

01:18:32.011 --> 01:18:34.710
What are you talking
about? Of course they did!

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:36.450
Your father wouldn't make
something like that up!

01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:38.583
- He's the one that told me!
- How can I trust you?

01:18:43.196 --> 01:18:44.589
I found the burner phone.

01:18:48.375 --> 01:18:50.464
I am so sorry, Charlie.

01:18:50.595 --> 01:18:51.727
I told the police
this afternoon.

01:18:53.946 --> 01:18:54.860
You told them what?

01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:59.212
I was so scared to be
blamed for Jack's murder.

01:18:59.343 --> 01:19:01.867
I wanted to make it look like
somebody was out to get me.

01:19:01.998 --> 01:19:05.871
I know it was stupid, but
it was all I could think of.

01:19:06.002 --> 01:19:08.439
So I sent the threatening texts

01:19:08.569 --> 01:19:11.311
and I lied about someone
following me the other night.

01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:15.838
Wow. You really thought
of everything, didn't you?

01:19:15.968 --> 01:19:19.058
How could you do that? I
was so worried about you!

01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:21.452
I'm deeply sorry, Charlie.

01:19:21.582 --> 01:19:24.107
The situation was escalating;
I didn't know what to do.

01:19:24.237 --> 01:19:26.109
So was it you that morning?

01:19:26.239 --> 01:19:28.633
Did you play intruder
in your own home?

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:32.245
I swear to you I didn't do it...

01:19:33.899 --> 01:19:35.945
but I think I know who did.

01:19:44.475 --> 01:19:45.476
Jack showed me the love
letter you wrote him.

01:19:45.606 --> 01:19:46.477
Oh, God.

01:19:46.607 --> 01:19:48.000
I knew it was in his dresser.

01:19:48.131 --> 01:19:50.263
And I was hoping he would
have gotten rid of it,

01:19:50.394 --> 01:19:52.135
but I saw it after he passed

01:19:52.265 --> 01:19:54.659
and now it's
nowhere to be found.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:57.662
You came into this
house. And you took it,

01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:00.186
hoping no one would know
your feelings for him.

01:20:00.317 --> 01:20:05.452
You are pitiful! STOP
LYING! It is over.

01:20:05.583 --> 01:20:09.500
Charlie, I just found
this gun in that cupboard.

01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:10.675
What?

01:20:12.111 --> 01:20:13.330
In that cupboard?

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:14.984
Yeah! It was underneath
all these papers.

01:20:16.942 --> 01:20:18.074
No.

01:20:19.684 --> 01:20:20.816
Give me the gun, Melody.

01:20:20.946 --> 01:20:23.644
I'll give it to
the police outside.

01:20:23.775 --> 01:20:25.081
OK.

01:20:27.039 --> 01:20:29.172
Melody! What are you
doing with a gun?

01:20:31.565 --> 01:20:35.178
We think that this is the gun
that Mila used to kill Jack.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.706
Mila didn't hide this gun.

01:20:43.969 --> 01:20:45.275
I know you're lying, Melody.

01:20:47.494 --> 01:20:50.236
Charlie, what are you doing?

01:20:50.367 --> 01:20:52.238
That's where the
burner phone was.

01:20:52.369 --> 01:20:55.111
I emptied that entire
cupboard. There was no gun!

01:20:59.376 --> 01:21:02.335
Wait a minute. Tim called me
and told me he found something

01:21:02.466 --> 01:21:03.946
and he knew who killed Jack!

01:21:07.210 --> 01:21:09.821
You framed him and tried to
plant the gun at his place.

01:21:09.952 --> 01:21:11.214
No!

01:21:11.344 --> 01:21:13.694
But Tim found the
gun. Didn't he.

01:21:15.479 --> 01:21:17.960
That's why you were in such a
rush to leave my house earlier?

01:21:21.267 --> 01:21:24.444
Tim knew. And you had no
choice but to kill him.

01:21:24.575 --> 01:21:26.229
And find someone
else to pin it on.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:32.409
You'll never be able
to prove anything.

01:21:32.757 --> 01:21:33.889
Don't move!

01:21:35.499 --> 01:21:38.589
Or what?

01:21:41.722 --> 01:21:42.767
I'll shoot.

01:21:46.423 --> 01:21:48.816
YOU KILLED MY DAD!
YOU KILLED MY DAD!

01:21:48.947 --> 01:21:50.862
Do you really think I would
give you a loaded gun?

01:21:50.993 --> 01:21:51.384
Admit it!

01:21:58.478 --> 01:21:59.305
He said that he loved me.

01:22:11.274 --> 01:22:13.450
I divorced Tim so that
we could be together,

01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:16.844
but when the time came... he
slept with that whore, Rebecca

01:22:16.975 --> 01:22:19.064
and then he wouldn't
sign the papers.

01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:21.197
So he got what he deserves!

01:22:21.327 --> 01:22:25.505
<i>Ferguson, we just got a</i><i>
tip. Listen carefully...</i>

01:22:25.636 --> 01:22:27.943
I'm telling the police
everything. You're done!

01:22:28.073 --> 01:22:31.337
Charlie! You stay right
there, or I'll kill Mila.

01:22:31.468 --> 01:22:34.297
Melody. Stop and think
about what you're doing.

01:22:34.427 --> 01:22:35.907
You'll never get away with this.

01:22:36.038 --> 01:22:38.692
There's nothing you can do
with the police outside!

01:22:42.348 --> 01:22:43.393
Help! We need help!

01:22:52.054 --> 01:22:54.056
Step away from
her! Put your hands up now!

01:22:54.186 --> 01:22:55.883
She tried to kill
me! She just tried--

01:22:56.014 --> 01:22:57.711
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

01:22:57.842 --> 01:22:59.539
What do you mean? No! They
were working together.

01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:00.323
We have your
confession recorded.

01:23:00.453 --> 01:23:01.889
What?

01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.935
Matthew was on the
phone the whole time.

01:23:04.066 --> 01:23:06.764
I'll put you in my pocket,
OK? Just don't say a word,

01:23:06.894 --> 01:23:08.505
<i>He slept with that whore Rebecca</i>

01:23:08.635 --> 01:23:09.985
<i>and then he wouldn't
sign the papers.</i>

01:23:10.115 --> 01:23:11.899
<i>So he got what he deserves!</i>

01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:13.118
<i>Faulkner speaking.</i>

01:23:13.249 --> 01:23:14.641
Melody confessed.

01:23:14.772 --> 01:23:16.600
I was on the phone with
Charlie and heard everything.

01:23:16.730 --> 01:23:19.342
<i>Thank you, Matthew. I'll
inform the officer out front.</i>

01:23:19.472 --> 01:23:21.561
- No!
- You're done!

01:23:21.692 --> 01:23:25.348
No! She's lying. She's lying!
You have to listen to me!

01:23:25.478 --> 01:23:30.875
I didn't do anything!

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:33.399
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

01:23:57.467 --> 01:23:58.076
No, wait!

01:24:03.125 --> 01:24:04.604
You did
great, young man.

01:24:04.735 --> 01:24:06.693
I've got the confession
recording; you've got Melody.

01:24:06.824 --> 01:24:08.956
Yeah, I've got everything. I've
got everything, thank you.

01:24:09.087 --> 01:24:10.741
Thank you.

01:24:10.871 --> 01:24:13.526
I heard them say they know for
sure that Melody killed Tim.

01:24:13.657 --> 01:24:15.180
And they know that
she killed Jack,

01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:17.748
thanks to you and Matthew.

01:24:17.878 --> 01:24:20.011
I can't believe I
thought you could've--

01:24:20.142 --> 01:24:24.102
No. It's OK. To be honest, I
would've thought it was me too.

01:24:24.233 --> 01:24:26.496
Melody played her
cards very well.

01:24:26.626 --> 01:24:29.064
Yeah! Until she didn't.

01:24:31.196 --> 01:24:33.155
Now she's gonna go to
jail for a very long time.

01:24:35.592 --> 01:24:38.377
I wanna say that
I'm really sorry.

01:24:38.508 --> 01:24:41.250
I learned my lesson from
keeping the truth from you.

01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:43.904
No more secrets. I promise.

01:24:45.689 --> 01:24:48.953
I know it's gonna be OK, but
it's just a lot right now.

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:52.696
I understand. I
love you, Charlie.

01:24:52.826 --> 01:24:56.265
And I'm gonna give you
the space that you need.

01:24:56.395 --> 01:24:58.223
Alyssa, thank you.

01:24:58.354 --> 01:25:00.095
I'm so grateful that
you've been here with her

01:25:00.225 --> 01:25:01.444
through all of this.

01:25:03.533 --> 01:25:04.969
We have a lot to catch up on.

01:25:06.013 --> 01:25:07.232
We sure do.

01:25:09.713 --> 01:25:11.367
I really miss Dad,

01:25:11.497 --> 01:25:14.413
but I'm really grateful to
have you both in my life.

01:25:14.544 --> 01:25:16.894
Aw, I love you.

01:25:17.024 --> 01:25:20.767
I think I speak for both of
us when I say "We do too",
