WEBVTT

00:00:00.636 --> 00:01:12.306

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:16.306
{\an8}I was with your daughter a moment ago.

00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:19.225
{\an8}There is no reason to hide it.

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:22.270
{\an8}And there will be nothing to worry about.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.690
Your Highness,

00:01:26.232 --> 00:01:28.735
I know that you are a man of your word.

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:31.613
And I also know

00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:34.365
that I'm being unfair to you.

00:01:35.742 --> 00:01:36.618
However,

00:01:37.493 --> 00:01:39.871
Eun-jo has already been through

00:01:40.538 --> 00:01:42.457
something even worse.

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:48.046
In the Gyeongo Year,
when I spoke my mind before His Majesty

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:50.632
out of sheer stubbornness…

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:52.634
Eun-jo! Madam!

00:01:52.717 --> 00:01:55.261
Let the criminal Hong Min-jik
keep his status,

00:01:55.345 --> 00:01:57.972
but seize everything he owns,
including his slaves.

00:01:58.056 --> 00:01:59.224
Yes, sir!

00:02:01.893 --> 00:02:03.019
Stop!

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:07.815
Whoever lays a hand on my family,

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.025
I will cut them down.

00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:11.778
- My lord.
- Father.

00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:17.408
Please sheathe your sword.

00:02:17.492 --> 00:02:18.451
Step back. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:20.245
Defying the royal command is treason.

00:02:20.328 --> 00:02:22.288
I won't let you be taken as a state slave.

00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:24.207
If you persist,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.209
I will take my own life right now.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:30.797
If you fall, my lord,

00:02:31.798 --> 00:02:35.093
I will have no world left to live in.

00:02:42.225 --> 00:02:43.851
I will follow you.

00:02:57.907 --> 00:02:59.409
My lord!

00:02:59.492 --> 00:03:01.369
That day, I collapsed,

00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:05.498
and from that time on,
she bore the burden of the household.

00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:09.919
That's why she became a physician.

00:03:11.546 --> 00:03:12.755
Hot!

00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:19.053
Since her earnings were not enough
to cover the cost of my medicine,

00:03:19.137 --> 00:03:20.555
she began making house calls,

00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:22.682
- treating women with moxibustion.
- Thank you.

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:25.810
She worked herself to the bone.

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:33.651
It says 30 du for one gyeol.

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:36.195
If the Second Minister asks for 100 du,

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:37.864
you may report it to the constabulary.

00:03:37.947 --> 00:03:40.366
She took care of all the neighbors
I had been taking care of.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.367
Now, blow!

00:03:42.452 --> 00:03:44.370
She took care of the Gwangtong Bridge kids

00:03:45.913 --> 00:03:47.582
and the patients at the Hyeminseo as well

00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:50.376
while I was bedridden.

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:57.300
And about a year ago,

00:03:57.383 --> 00:03:59.469
when I finally woke up…

00:04:00.178 --> 00:04:02.263
Please cook this for my lord,
for his recovery.

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:05.266
It's not much, but I hope it helps.

00:04:05.975 --> 00:04:08.102
I picked these flowers from the field.

00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:13.649
These are from people
wishing you a full recovery.

00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:20.740
I hope their kindness
helps you regain your strength.

00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:34.921
She even bore my burden for me.

00:04:35.922 --> 00:04:37.465
That's the kind of girl she is.

00:04:43.554 --> 00:04:44.972
I promise

00:04:46.224 --> 00:04:47.475
I will not add to her burden.

00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:52.105
I know that

00:04:52.188 --> 00:04:55.066
it's cruel of me
to make this request before I leave.

00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:00.822
Please forgive me.

00:05:05.535 --> 00:05:07.286
How much longer until the tavern?

00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:10.706
We're almost there.

00:05:11.874 --> 00:05:14.210
This is the tenth time you've said that.

00:05:26.973 --> 00:05:30.017
It's pretty crowded.
Is there some kind of celebration in town?

00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:31.477
We're celebrating a disaster.

00:05:32.061 --> 00:05:34.397
They've all been driven out here
because of the king.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.940
Driven out?

00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:38.526
Because of the king's hunting trip
at the Royal Villa,

00:05:38.609 --> 00:05:41.988
all the people living in the nearby town
have been driven out.

00:05:44.365 --> 00:05:47.994
So all those people were forced out
of their homes and left on the streets?

00:05:48.744 --> 00:05:50.204
I suppose that's what happened.

00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:55.793
What do we do?

00:05:58.045 --> 00:06:00.923
How are we going to live from now on?

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.222
This is insane!
We can't even harvest these!

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:16.105
I did hear that His Majesty's procession
crossed the farmlands,

00:06:16.522 --> 00:06:18.024
but this is worse than I thought.

00:06:20.234 --> 00:06:22.486
Their entire year's harvest
has been ruined.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.739
What did we do to deserve this?

00:06:24.822 --> 00:06:29.368
The king says it's our fault
for not harvesting sooner.

00:06:29.452 --> 00:06:32.455
The crops have to ripen
before we can harvest them!

00:06:44.383 --> 00:06:47.345
Well, if it isn't
the only honest subject in my kingdom.

00:07:33.975 --> 00:07:37.728
What happened to Lord Hong Min-jik?

00:07:38.646 --> 00:07:40.314
He offered frank counsel to His Majesty,

00:07:42.483 --> 00:07:43.651
and he became prey

00:07:45.194 --> 00:07:46.654
in His Majesty's hunt.

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.880
She seems calm so far.

00:08:45.963 --> 00:08:47.798
She hasn't even cried yet.

00:08:53.638 --> 00:08:56.641
I'm saying this
so you won't ever come back.

00:08:57.141 --> 00:08:59.852
Now, please leave
before Hong Eun-jo comes back.

00:09:01.604 --> 00:09:02.813
She's not at home?

00:09:03.397 --> 00:09:05.066
She's out preparing for the funeral.

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:07.401
But I've been here for over four hours.

00:09:12.073 --> 00:09:13.157
She can't be…

00:09:14.867 --> 00:09:15.951
Did you find her?

00:09:16.035 --> 00:09:17.244
No.

00:09:17.328 --> 00:09:19.914
His Majesty's arrow was in her room,
and it's gone now.

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:22.124
If what I think happens,

00:09:22.208 --> 00:09:23.626
not only Eun-jo,

00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:25.920
but her entire family will be executed.

00:09:26.754 --> 00:09:27.755
What do you mean?

00:09:29.465 --> 00:09:30.675
We must not let that happen.

00:09:33.594 --> 00:09:34.929
Never.

00:09:41.477 --> 00:09:42.770
Father.

00:09:55.491 --> 00:09:57.326
Protect His Majesty and His Highness!

00:10:21.642 --> 00:10:23.394
Find the assassin!

00:10:24.979 --> 00:10:26.188
Do you have a death wish?

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:29.817
If you want to die, die alone.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.528
If they find out,
your mother and Dae-il will die like dogs,

00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:34.822
and your father's body
will be torn apart even in death!

00:10:36.073 --> 00:10:37.700
Hong Eun-jo! Snap out of it!

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.956
He even jumped in to stop it.

00:11:07.396 --> 00:11:09.732
Eun-jo looked like a mess
when she came back.

00:11:09.815 --> 00:11:12.568
Where did she go
to ruin her silk shoes like that?

00:11:14.612 --> 00:11:16.363
She must not be quite herself right now.

00:11:16.447 --> 00:11:18.157
She fell a few times on her way home.

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:22.244
No wonder.

00:11:22.828 --> 00:11:23.871
I'll see how she's doing.

00:11:25.289 --> 00:11:27.458
Make sure she stays in the room.

00:11:28.459 --> 00:11:30.628
If a lowly concubine's daughter
appears at the funeral,

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.671
the people will tear her apart.

00:11:39.053 --> 00:11:41.430
Return!

00:11:43.474 --> 00:11:46.143
Return!

00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:49.980
Return!

00:11:55.277 --> 00:11:58.113
My lord!

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.823
Thank you.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.426
Pay your respects with utmost sincerity.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.557
On the bare ground?

00:14:05.324 --> 00:14:06.950
The Chief State Councilor lost his mind.

00:14:07.034 --> 00:14:09.328
He even brought students
from the Royal Confucian Academy.

00:14:10.037 --> 00:14:11.121
It was a good death anyway.

00:14:11.205 --> 00:14:13.040
Thanks to His Majesty's rampage--

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.418
Today,

00:14:17.294 --> 00:14:19.296
we're mourning. Nothing else.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.466
Your Majesty,

00:14:22.549 --> 00:14:24.969
now is not a good time.

00:14:25.511 --> 00:14:28.430
Please come back on a sunny day.

00:14:29.556 --> 00:14:30.849
Geum-nok,

00:14:30.933 --> 00:14:32.893
do not play gatekeeper.

00:14:33.978 --> 00:14:36.939
Stand aside and look pretty.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.067
It is the only way

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.860
you will survive in this palace.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.253
Are you weary, Your Majesty?

00:14:59.837 --> 00:15:03.048
After killing
the only loyal subject in this kingdom,

00:15:03.632 --> 00:15:04.967
how do you sleep so peacefully?

00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:25.612
Yeol!

00:15:33.495 --> 00:15:35.122
What happened?

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:39.835
This saved your life.

00:15:41.045 --> 00:15:44.715
This stopped the arrow.
It saved your life.

00:15:49.344 --> 00:15:50.262
LIFE

00:15:53.432 --> 00:15:54.600
Dae-chu.

00:15:54.683 --> 00:15:57.227
Your Highness is safe and sound
in your residence,

00:15:57.311 --> 00:15:58.187
but the assassin

00:15:58.812 --> 00:15:59.688
is still at large.

00:16:01.523 --> 00:16:02.691
Bring in the royal physician.

00:16:02.775 --> 00:16:04.526
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:16:06.904 --> 00:16:07.863
I'm sorry.

00:16:09.782 --> 00:16:11.575
What matters is that you're alive.

00:16:12.367 --> 00:16:14.953
That is all I ask of you.

00:16:20.292 --> 00:16:21.543
How long have I been here?

00:16:23.337 --> 00:16:24.421
It's been five days.

00:16:27.841 --> 00:16:29.051
Where are you going?

00:16:31.178 --> 00:16:32.012
I must see him.

00:16:46.819 --> 00:16:48.028
Your Majesty.

00:16:48.529 --> 00:16:50.197
You may go in, but you won't see him.

00:16:50.906 --> 00:16:52.324
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

00:16:53.659 --> 00:16:55.202
His Majesty

00:16:56.912 --> 00:16:59.832
has been unable to awaken
from his deep sleep.

00:17:02.793 --> 00:17:05.295
What should we do now?

00:17:20.477 --> 00:17:22.229
Both of my parents

00:17:22.813 --> 00:17:26.358
passed away from a plague when I was five.

00:17:27.901 --> 00:17:31.405
I wish I could miss my parents
like my brothers do,

00:17:32.573 --> 00:17:34.158
but I don't even remember their faces.

00:17:36.451 --> 00:17:38.495
Sometimes, I feel like crying,

00:17:40.205 --> 00:17:41.707
but I can't seem to cry.

00:17:47.546 --> 00:17:49.548
I'm not very good at offering comfort,

00:17:51.633 --> 00:17:54.553
so I thought I'd share
a piece of my own sadness.

00:18:06.773 --> 00:18:08.901
I'll come back tomorrow.

00:18:52.903 --> 00:18:56.615
I wish them to treat you with respect.
That's why I prepared these.

00:18:57.282 --> 00:18:58.575
So be sure to wear them.

00:20:41.345 --> 00:20:42.429
I know.

00:20:44.306 --> 00:20:45.557
I don't deserve

00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:47.726
to ask for forgiveness,

00:20:51.021 --> 00:20:52.356
or even to mourn him.

00:21:18.048 --> 00:21:19.174
Please go.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.402
I'll come again tomorrow.

00:22:03.135 --> 00:22:04.845
I told you to go.

00:22:04.928 --> 00:22:06.346
Did you not hear what I said?

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.432
At least let me see you reach the capital.

00:22:08.515 --> 00:22:09.641
I don't need that.

00:22:09.724 --> 00:22:11.560
If you go looking like that…

00:22:11.643 --> 00:22:12.978
That's none of your concern.

00:22:21.069 --> 00:22:22.821
Why are you looking like that?

00:22:23.238 --> 00:22:24.573
It's not like you did it.

00:22:25.532 --> 00:22:26.992
Why don't you just blame me?

00:22:29.161 --> 00:22:30.453
Hate me.

00:22:30.537 --> 00:22:31.663
Despise me.

00:22:32.998 --> 00:22:34.666
I can take worse than that.

00:22:38.503 --> 00:22:40.839
My mother and young master

00:22:42.215 --> 00:22:43.508
can't even blame

00:22:44.217 --> 00:22:48.305
the man who killed
their husband and father.

00:22:49.055 --> 00:22:52.309
Because hating His Majesty
would be high treason.

00:22:54.394 --> 00:22:56.605
They can't even cry out loud,

00:22:57.647 --> 00:22:58.899
because

00:22:59.691 --> 00:23:01.067
His Majesty might hear them.

00:23:03.153 --> 00:23:04.613
And that

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:06.740
breaks my heart.

00:23:11.536 --> 00:23:12.996
If there is anything

00:23:13.788 --> 00:23:14.664
I can--

00:23:14.748 --> 00:23:15.790
No.

00:23:18.585 --> 00:23:20.253
You can't do that now.

00:23:23.089 --> 00:23:24.257
You are

00:23:24.841 --> 00:23:26.176
not supposed to do that.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.480
You.

00:23:39.147 --> 00:23:41.066
You can't see
His Highness right now, right?

00:23:44.069 --> 00:23:45.946
Then let me be an uninvited guest here.

00:23:48.949 --> 00:23:50.283
And I'll do my job properly.

00:23:59.417 --> 00:24:00.418
Go.

00:24:20.063 --> 00:24:21.940
I tailed Hong Eun-jo.

00:24:26.111 --> 00:24:27.904
Who knows what trouble she'll cause next.

00:24:29.364 --> 00:24:30.573
Well done.

00:24:30.657 --> 00:24:32.117
So, for now,

00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:34.411
set those unnecessary feelings aside.

00:24:52.262 --> 00:24:53.430
I'm fine.

00:24:55.015 --> 00:24:56.933
I'm breathing all right,

00:24:57.642 --> 00:24:59.728
and my heart is beating just like before.

00:25:00.312 --> 00:25:01.604
I'm eating well,

00:25:01.688 --> 00:25:03.023
and I've slept well.

00:25:04.316 --> 00:25:06.401
Though it seems my life won't be as good

00:25:08.194 --> 00:25:09.696
as it used to be.

00:25:13.658 --> 00:25:14.534
I didn't ask.

00:25:16.328 --> 00:25:17.162
Exactly.

00:25:17.912 --> 00:25:19.831
I wish you had asked.

00:25:35.805 --> 00:25:38.725
The Queen Consort and I
arranged those chance encounters.

00:25:38.808 --> 00:25:40.226
I ask for your understanding.

00:25:40.727 --> 00:25:44.230
It was a mother's desperate attempt
to save her son.

00:25:44.814 --> 00:25:46.066
Please do not concern yourself.

00:25:47.442 --> 00:25:50.278
Is His Highness all right?

00:25:50.653 --> 00:25:53.239
I stayed away
so I wouldn't disrupt his recovery.

00:25:54.908 --> 00:25:56.868
I hear he's been visiting

00:25:56.951 --> 00:25:59.829
Lord Hong's grave a lot
despite his injuries.

00:26:00.288 --> 00:26:03.208
Were they acquainted?

00:26:04.709 --> 00:26:06.878
I hear they recently
got to know each other.

00:26:07.754 --> 00:26:10.090
He must be feeling guilty.

00:26:12.675 --> 00:26:14.469
His Majesty finally crossed the line.

00:26:16.721 --> 00:26:18.681
- Move out!
- Yes, sir!

00:26:31.861 --> 00:26:32.987
Your Highness,

00:26:33.071 --> 00:26:34.531
the State Tribunal found out that

00:26:34.614 --> 00:26:36.533
the arrow belonged to His Majesty.

00:26:36.616 --> 00:26:37.951
The motive is a personal grudge.

00:26:38.034 --> 00:26:40.954
And the evidence is
it's the arrow that struck Lord Hong.

00:26:41.037 --> 00:26:44.290
For now, Lord Hong's family
are the prime suspects.

00:26:45.583 --> 00:26:46.751
Send for Im Jae-i at once.

00:26:46.835 --> 00:26:49.129
I will steal one of His Majesty's arrows.

00:27:00.098 --> 00:27:01.182
What's going on?

00:27:01.266 --> 00:27:03.643
We're on our way
to search Lord Hong's house.

00:27:09.107 --> 00:27:10.442
As I said already,

00:27:10.525 --> 00:27:14.112
I was too shaken at the time
to retrieve the arrow stuck in him!

00:27:15.155 --> 00:27:17.031
It must be somewhere in our house.

00:27:17.115 --> 00:27:19.534
Let me look for it again.

00:27:19.617 --> 00:27:21.911
If you don't show us the arrow,
you will be a suspect.

00:27:23.621 --> 00:27:25.623
Find any trace of the assassin!

00:27:25.707 --> 00:27:26.666
Yes, sir!

00:27:28.835 --> 00:27:31.087
Wait. Assassin?

00:27:31.171 --> 00:27:34.007
Someone tried to assassinate His Majesty
with an arrow.

00:27:36.843 --> 00:27:38.261
It was me.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.099
That arrow tore into my lord's flesh.

00:27:44.392 --> 00:27:45.810
I couldn't bear the sight of it,

00:27:46.644 --> 00:27:48.104
so I threw it away.

00:27:48.938 --> 00:27:50.773
If that's the reason, I'm the only one--

00:27:50.857 --> 00:27:52.233
Where did you throw it away?

00:27:58.948 --> 00:28:00.950
Answer me. Where did you throw it away?

00:28:05.663 --> 00:28:07.999
If the arrow is not found
where you say it is,

00:28:08.583 --> 00:28:11.753
both you and your family will be arrested.

00:28:13.004 --> 00:28:15.048
Madam.

00:28:20.386 --> 00:28:21.513
Tell me

00:28:22.847 --> 00:28:24.307
where it is.

00:28:35.401 --> 00:28:36.778
The stream.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.738
I threw it by the stream.

00:28:43.827 --> 00:28:45.537
I will go and look for it.

00:28:50.667 --> 00:28:52.752
His Highness said
there's no need for words.

00:29:14.691 --> 00:29:16.317
It is His Majesty's arrow.

00:29:16.401 --> 00:29:18.570
- Withdraw.
- Yes, sir!

00:29:20.363 --> 00:29:22.949
This is unacceptable!

00:29:23.032 --> 00:29:24.158
My father was killed

00:29:24.242 --> 00:29:28.746
by His Majesty's arrow!
Don't you think that's enough pain for us?

00:29:30.081 --> 00:29:31.875
Young Master, please stop.

00:29:32.959 --> 00:29:34.335
I apologize.

00:29:34.419 --> 00:29:36.713
Please forget what he just said.

00:29:53.479 --> 00:29:54.731
Wait.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:00.069
With everything

00:30:00.153 --> 00:30:02.530
that has happened,
I didn't get to say this.

00:30:03.156 --> 00:30:04.449
On the cliff that day--

00:30:04.532 --> 00:30:06.326
I only gave back what I got.

00:30:09.078 --> 00:30:10.580
Do you want to be sold that badly?

00:30:19.839 --> 00:30:21.132
You saved

00:30:21.215 --> 00:30:23.176
my mother, my young master

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.136
and me.

00:30:26.846 --> 00:30:27.889
And about

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:29.933
the person

00:30:30.767 --> 00:30:33.144
struck by the arrow that day…

00:30:35.813 --> 00:30:37.065
He's alive.

00:30:40.944 --> 00:30:42.195
That's a relief.

00:30:42.946 --> 00:30:44.238
Where is he?

00:30:45.156 --> 00:30:46.991
What I did was unforgivable.

00:30:47.075 --> 00:30:49.827
I know it's late, but I want to apologize.

00:30:56.918 --> 00:30:58.127
I heard he's fine.

00:31:00.838 --> 00:31:04.175
He's breathing all right,
and his heart is beating like before.

00:31:04.676 --> 00:31:06.511
He's eating well, and he's slept well.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.805
Though he said

00:31:09.847 --> 00:31:12.350
his life wasn't as good as it used to be.

00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:15.728
Do you know him?

00:31:16.938 --> 00:31:18.356
I'm sure you know him better.

00:31:23.027 --> 00:31:26.155
Other than the king himself,

00:31:26.239 --> 00:31:28.866
who do you think
could steal a royal family's arrow?

00:31:30.368 --> 00:31:32.203
Hong Eun-jo! Snap out of it!

00:31:32.286 --> 00:31:34.497
He even jumped in to stop it.

00:31:37.917 --> 00:31:38.960
It can't be…

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.929
Could you

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.016
slap me hard again?

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.935
From now on,

00:31:56.019 --> 00:31:58.896
I really need to get it together.

00:32:03.609 --> 00:32:04.444
Your Highness. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:32:05.737 --> 00:32:06.571
How did it go?

00:32:06.654 --> 00:32:08.489
The State Tribunal has withdrawn.

00:32:14.912 --> 00:32:16.039
Your Highness.

00:32:20.126 --> 00:32:21.961
Have we found the assassin yet?

00:32:22.045 --> 00:32:25.882
I still suspect
Lord Hong Min-jik's family.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.430
Really? That family?

00:32:33.181 --> 00:32:36.768
Min-jik's eldest son doesn't have the guts
or the skills to do that.

00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:39.145
The other one is his concubine's daughter.

00:32:39.228 --> 00:32:41.481
I hear the number of arrows
His Majesty used in this hunt

00:32:41.564 --> 00:32:43.232
exceeds those used in the Eulmyo War.

00:32:44.275 --> 00:32:48.154
His Majesty's arrows are scattered
all around the Royal Villa unretrieved.

00:32:50.156 --> 00:32:51.199
Should we interrogate

00:32:51.282 --> 00:32:53.785
all thousands of people
cast out of Chungcheong?

00:32:56.245 --> 00:32:58.372
I hear Grand Prince Dowol woke up.
Go and talk to him.

00:32:58.956 --> 00:33:01.084
He made his move
knowing the assassin's plan.

00:33:01.167 --> 00:33:02.710
He must have had a source.

00:33:03.836 --> 00:33:04.962
Let me go and talk to him.

00:33:05.546 --> 00:33:07.840
We're not on good terms,
but I've talked to him before.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:11.177
Just make up some excuse.

00:33:12.261 --> 00:33:15.264
Say I lost my memory from the shock,
or something along those lines.

00:33:17.517 --> 00:33:19.185
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

00:33:19.268 --> 00:33:21.187
You don't joke because you're in the mood.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:22.688
You joke to get in the mood.

00:33:26.067 --> 00:33:27.735
"The Gyeongo Year was not forgotten."

00:33:27.819 --> 00:33:30.947
Tell him that message
was put up in the market again.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.241
He's always under threat of assassination,

00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:35.034
so you make up the rest.

00:33:36.327 --> 00:33:37.912
So you're ordering me around now?

00:33:38.913 --> 00:33:40.540
We want to protect the same person.

00:33:41.791 --> 00:33:43.543
It's a strategic alliance.

00:33:45.378 --> 00:33:47.004
Since we're on the same side,

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:50.716
we could be friends too.

00:33:55.054 --> 00:33:56.264
That would be difficult.

00:33:58.141 --> 00:33:59.392
I told Hong Eun-jo

00:34:00.893 --> 00:34:03.396
who struck Your Highness with the arrow.

00:34:05.815 --> 00:34:08.401
She's already overwhelmed with grief now.

00:34:08.484 --> 00:34:10.653
- Why did you do that?
- She needs to know.

00:34:10.736 --> 00:34:13.322
She needs to know
where her anger was directed

00:34:14.073 --> 00:34:17.118
so she won't make a foolish choice
like taking her own life.

00:34:18.077 --> 00:34:19.871
And she will walk away.

00:34:19.954 --> 00:34:23.332
Once she sees
where this wretched tie leads,

00:34:25.418 --> 00:34:27.128
she will have to walk away.

00:34:29.547 --> 00:34:30.673
So…

00:34:31.507 --> 00:34:33.092
I hope you recover soon.

00:34:34.302 --> 00:34:36.804
I'm saying this as someone
who was briefly your friend.

00:34:39.849 --> 00:34:43.352
HYEMINSEO

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.217
Go. I don't need that.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.468
That's none of your concern.

00:35:49.126 --> 00:35:51.420
It looks like you're in a hurry.

00:35:51.504 --> 00:35:53.214
If you're making a house call…

00:35:53.881 --> 00:35:55.925
I was on my way to see you.

00:35:59.011 --> 00:36:00.888
I guess I'm a little late.

00:36:03.975 --> 00:36:05.851
Shall we step inside for a bit?

00:36:07.895 --> 00:36:09.230
About that day…

00:36:09.313 --> 00:36:10.648
Don't worry about it.

00:36:12.984 --> 00:36:14.026
I came to say this.

00:36:24.912 --> 00:36:26.247
I'm fine.

00:36:26.872 --> 00:36:29.542
The royal physician said
that I had a naturally strong heart.

00:36:53.357 --> 00:36:54.358
See?

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.236
It's beating.

00:37:24.305 --> 00:37:25.765
It must have

00:37:26.515 --> 00:37:27.683
hurt so much.

00:37:31.604 --> 00:37:32.438
Not at all.

00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:37.151
I was just glad

00:37:37.234 --> 00:37:39.070
the arrow struck here.

00:38:00.299 --> 00:38:01.592
I'm sorry.

00:38:04.303 --> 00:38:05.513
I'm really

00:38:06.764 --> 00:38:08.099
sorry.

00:38:48.764 --> 00:38:50.474
Are you going to stay out here all night?

00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:53.727
I'm thinking about

00:38:54.895 --> 00:38:57.273
how I can dry her tears.

00:39:27.178 --> 00:39:28.804
What are you doing?

00:39:30.181 --> 00:39:31.098
Recovery workout.

00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:33.601
I happened to come across a sturdy tree.

00:39:33.684 --> 00:39:35.102
Bye then.

00:39:56.707 --> 00:39:58.542
I came across another sturdy tree.

00:39:59.251 --> 00:40:00.794
Bye then.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:18.187
You finished early.

00:40:18.854 --> 00:40:20.606
He said he wanted to learn some skills.

00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:26.529
Can we talk?

00:40:30.574 --> 00:40:31.575
What is it?

00:40:32.117 --> 00:40:33.744
What are you going to nag me about?

00:40:40.459 --> 00:40:41.794
I know

00:40:42.503 --> 00:40:43.337
what you're doing.

00:40:47.466 --> 00:40:48.592
I got the message.

00:40:54.306 --> 00:40:55.724
Was it too obvious?

00:40:59.186 --> 00:41:00.688
Don't overdo it.

00:41:04.233 --> 00:41:07.027
Even if it's obvious, just buy it.

00:41:07.444 --> 00:41:09.154
Just play along

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:13.450
and forget who you shot that day.

00:41:15.578 --> 00:41:17.454
I know you can't forget
what happened that day,

00:41:19.498 --> 00:41:21.083
and you probably shouldn't,

00:41:23.335 --> 00:41:24.962
but at least forget that part.

00:41:26.171 --> 00:41:27.923
At least just this part.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.512
If you promise me that,

00:41:34.054 --> 00:41:35.764
I'll stop telling such obvious lies.

00:41:44.773 --> 00:41:45.941
I promise.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.237
I'll try to forget.

00:41:57.286 --> 00:41:59.788
RESPECTED GENTLEMEN OF THE NAMYANG
HONG CLAN - TONGJEONG DAEBU

00:42:05.336 --> 00:42:06.920
What I did was wrong.

00:42:17.139 --> 00:42:20.434
Once you draw the bowstring,
hold your breath.

00:42:20.517 --> 00:42:23.562
Even the gentlest breeze
can sway an arrow.

00:42:28.317 --> 00:42:31.403
Once you draw the bowstring,
still your emotions.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.823
Even the slightest sadness
can make an arrow veer.

00:42:37.826 --> 00:42:40.537
I'm scared, my lord.

00:42:41.664 --> 00:42:42.873
What if

00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:46.335
I end up hurting someone?

00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:51.799
Swords and bows are not for hurting.

00:42:52.383 --> 00:42:54.259
They're for protecting.

00:42:57.137 --> 00:42:59.056
I was blinded by my anger

00:42:59.682 --> 00:43:02.101
and I ended up doing the same thing

00:43:02.184 --> 00:43:04.144
the king did to you, Father.

00:43:07.106 --> 00:43:08.607
I deserve your scolding.

00:43:32.005 --> 00:43:34.508
When can we see His Majesty?

00:43:35.509 --> 00:43:38.178
His Majesty's heart
has been troubled lately. Please wait.

00:43:38.262 --> 00:43:41.390
Rumor has it that His Majesty isn't well.

00:43:44.935 --> 00:43:48.230
I hope that's not what you're wishing for.

00:43:48.689 --> 00:43:50.023
That's absurd.

00:43:50.858 --> 00:43:51.692
All I meant was

00:43:51.775 --> 00:43:54.403
that you shouldn't be solely in charge,
if that's the case.

00:44:06.248 --> 00:44:08.417
He raised concerns about the damage

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.837
His Majesty's hunting and parties
caused the people.

00:44:13.172 --> 00:44:17.092
And that infuriated His Majesty.

00:44:19.178 --> 00:44:20.471
Until the very end,

00:44:22.598 --> 00:44:23.974
he stayed true to himself.

00:44:29.396 --> 00:44:32.441
As you said, Lord Hong Min-jik

00:44:32.524 --> 00:44:35.194
was a subject
who gave only honest and necessary advice.

00:44:36.111 --> 00:44:39.072
All the subjects who challenged
His Majesty had been killed,

00:44:40.532 --> 00:44:42.743
but he kept Lord Hong alive.

00:44:49.333 --> 00:44:50.751
As you know, it's because

00:44:51.919 --> 00:44:53.879
he was both the teacher
and friend of His Majesty.

00:44:58.133 --> 00:44:59.676
Are you sure that was the only reason?

00:45:01.887 --> 00:45:05.140
I wouldn't dare lie to you, Your Highness.

00:45:07.351 --> 00:45:08.560
How's the king?

00:45:10.312 --> 00:45:12.689
I heard he's still asleep.

00:45:15.275 --> 00:45:18.278
Something is happening in his bedchamber.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.864
What could it be?

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.701
How is he?

00:45:25.577 --> 00:45:26.954
He perks up briefly,

00:45:27.538 --> 00:45:30.082
then falls asleep after each meal
as the medicine takes effect.

00:45:34.503 --> 00:45:36.213
What happened on the hunting trip

00:45:36.797 --> 00:45:39.091
must never be revealed to anyone.

00:45:41.718 --> 00:45:44.179
They are your people, Your Majesty.

00:45:44.263 --> 00:45:45.973
Please take pity on them.

00:46:00.779 --> 00:46:03.574
That's enough. You're ruining my mood.

00:46:08.328 --> 00:46:11.665
Min-jik, go back to the capital
and wait for my command.

00:46:15.419 --> 00:46:17.671
Let's begin the hunt!

00:47:08.138 --> 00:47:09.723
It's a tiger.

00:47:18.607 --> 00:47:20.984
Bring the tiger I hunted!

00:47:52.057 --> 00:47:54.976
The herb can cause
visual and auditory hallucinations?

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.145
How could you not tell me that?

00:47:57.979 --> 00:48:00.732
Tomorrow, he could see me as a fox
and hunt me too!

00:48:00.816 --> 00:48:03.735
And that would be too honorable a death
for a lowlife like you.

00:48:07.948 --> 00:48:10.242
Send the body to Min-jik's son

00:48:10.659 --> 00:48:12.411
and give him a horse.

00:48:15.247 --> 00:48:18.792
I guess I forgot my place for a moment.

00:48:30.429 --> 00:48:32.514
Let the king lie there

00:48:33.265 --> 00:48:35.600
and become a living corpse.

00:48:37.644 --> 00:48:39.771
Don't worry.

00:49:11.845 --> 00:49:12.929
Now,

00:49:14.181 --> 00:49:15.974
come back to this place of torment.

00:49:26.651 --> 00:49:29.946
Everything you saw and heard here
must remain completely secret.

00:49:31.823 --> 00:49:32.949
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:49:42.626 --> 00:49:44.169
Because that secret ends with you.

00:49:46.546 --> 00:49:47.380
It's done. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:51.134
I know you're busy.

00:49:51.885 --> 00:49:54.179
Sorry for troubling you with this.

00:49:55.055 --> 00:49:57.474
Don't worry. It's what I do.

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:00.477
I heard what happened to Lord Hong.

00:50:01.269 --> 00:50:02.103
I'm truly sorry.

00:50:13.782 --> 00:50:15.325
Can you go on living?

00:50:21.748 --> 00:50:23.458
It won't be like before.

00:50:24.125 --> 00:50:25.669
You've lost your world.

00:50:29.756 --> 00:50:32.133
That's why I'm dying too.

00:50:33.718 --> 00:50:35.428
I offer my deepest condolences.

00:50:44.229 --> 00:50:45.272
Are you Gil-dong?

00:50:45.856 --> 00:50:47.566
We need Gil-dong's name.

00:50:47.649 --> 00:50:49.734
You're the one who needed the name of…

00:50:51.152 --> 00:50:52.153
It's nice to meet you…

00:50:53.822 --> 00:50:55.448
Gil-dong.

00:50:59.578 --> 00:51:01.997
Who are you?

00:51:02.414 --> 00:51:05.083
I'm a mother
whose son was taken away by the king.

00:51:05.917 --> 00:51:09.671
I'm an orphan
whose family was taken away by the king.

00:51:09.754 --> 00:51:12.883
I'm a father
whose daughter was taken away.

00:51:14.301 --> 00:51:16.553
I'm a child whose sibling was taken away.

00:51:17.178 --> 00:51:19.973
I'm an old monk
whose friend was taken away.

00:51:20.932 --> 00:51:23.310
I'm a subject
whose loyalty was taken away.

00:51:28.064 --> 00:51:30.901
We have all lost our worlds.

00:51:37.866 --> 00:51:39.034
The palace.

00:51:42.787 --> 00:51:44.623
Your Majesty,

00:51:44.706 --> 00:51:47.292
please reconsider your decision!

00:51:47.375 --> 00:51:48.376
Royal Confucian Academy.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:51.087
Please reconsider your decision!

00:51:52.631 --> 00:51:54.549
Markets. Schools.

00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:56.718
In every corner of this kingdom,

00:51:57.177 --> 00:51:59.137
there are people like you.

00:52:14.653 --> 00:52:18.531
Where will Gil-dong's name be used?

00:52:19.407 --> 00:52:23.620
His name will represent the people
worn down by poverty and oppression.

00:52:27.958 --> 00:52:30.126
And what is the purpose?

00:52:31.336 --> 00:52:32.671
It is

00:52:32.754 --> 00:52:35.423
to take down the one on the throne.

00:52:36.257 --> 00:52:37.842
The throne?

00:52:39.803 --> 00:52:41.179
Does that mean…

00:52:44.307 --> 00:52:45.225
A revolt.

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.312
That's how it will be recorded in history

00:52:49.813 --> 00:52:51.898
if we fail.

00:52:55.485 --> 00:52:57.988
Gil-dong is nothing more
than a petty thief.

00:52:58.071 --> 00:52:59.489
He cannot represent the people.

00:53:00.031 --> 00:53:01.992
The return of Im Kkeok-jeong's spirit.

00:53:02.075 --> 00:53:03.243
The great thief.

00:53:03.326 --> 00:53:04.619
A beast with monstrous strength.

00:53:04.703 --> 00:53:06.454
A legendary hermit. An immortal being.

00:53:06.538 --> 00:53:08.498
They're nothing but false rumors.

00:53:08.581 --> 00:53:09.916
They're dreams.

00:53:11.668 --> 00:53:13.169
And they're hopes.

00:53:17.632 --> 00:53:19.050
Gil-dong always came by

00:53:19.134 --> 00:53:20.844
whenever I was hungry and sick,

00:53:20.927 --> 00:53:23.638
although I don't know how he always knew.

00:53:25.015 --> 00:53:26.850
So each time he came by,

00:53:26.933 --> 00:53:28.685
the warmth he left behind
made me so happy.

00:53:28.768 --> 00:53:30.311
Gil-dong!

00:53:31.312 --> 00:53:34.065
It seems like Gil-dong
is looking after us as well.

00:53:34.733 --> 00:53:37.902
There is nowhere in Joseon

00:53:37.986 --> 00:53:40.780
that Gil-dong's hands cannot reach!

00:53:44.784 --> 00:53:47.037
"A friend on the road"?

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:48.663
Is that what it means?

00:53:51.624 --> 00:53:53.543
If the one who sits on the throne changes,

00:53:55.712 --> 00:53:57.964
will the world change?

00:53:58.798 --> 00:54:00.925
Yesterday, my son died.

00:54:01.593 --> 00:54:03.928
Today, your father died.

00:54:04.929 --> 00:54:07.599
Tomorrow, it could be
your mother and brother.

00:54:08.224 --> 00:54:09.225
And then,

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:11.352
you could be next.

00:54:15.607 --> 00:54:18.443
At the very least,
we will be able to change tomorrow

00:54:18.526 --> 00:54:20.278
and the days that follow.

00:54:41.466 --> 00:54:44.052
Did you expect Gil-dong's refusal?

00:54:45.595 --> 00:54:47.347
She will return,

00:54:47.847 --> 00:54:49.474
to continue her life.

00:54:55.313 --> 00:54:58.483
Before that, we must find a way
to approach the king's bedchamber.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.445
We must find out
what's going on in the palace.

00:55:29.139 --> 00:55:30.265
You're back.

00:55:31.766 --> 00:55:34.936
His Majesty woke up.
Inform Her Majesty at once!

00:55:35.019 --> 00:55:36.563
Yes, my lady.

00:55:42.861 --> 00:55:44.070
Where are you going?

00:55:45.738 --> 00:55:47.782
Assemble the State Tribunal.

00:55:55.081 --> 00:55:57.458
This traitor attempted
to assassinated His Majesty.

00:55:57.542 --> 00:55:59.711
- Seize him!
- Yes, sir!

00:56:00.795 --> 00:56:02.172
What's this about?

00:56:02.714 --> 00:56:03.631
Your Highness!

00:56:06.009 --> 00:56:08.553
His Majesty is now questioning
Hong Min-jik's eldest son.

00:56:16.895 --> 00:56:20.190
I know nothing about it, Your Majesty!

00:56:20.273 --> 00:56:23.276
The State Tribunal
inspected the area thoroughly

00:56:23.359 --> 00:56:24.819
before the royal procession arrived.

00:56:25.403 --> 00:56:26.863
Do you still deny it?

00:56:26.946 --> 00:56:30.700
How does that make me the assassin?

00:56:30.783 --> 00:56:32.076
Throughout all of Joseon,

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:35.705
there is but one archer
who can strike a target

00:56:35.788 --> 00:56:37.332
from five ri.

00:56:41.085 --> 00:56:42.295
Who is it?

00:56:46.674 --> 00:56:47.842
That was…

00:56:51.179 --> 00:56:52.889
my father.

00:57:04.234 --> 00:57:06.444
And who inherited his blood?

00:57:14.786 --> 00:57:16.120
I don't hear any answer.

00:57:16.204 --> 00:57:17.664
Twist his legs.

00:57:17.747 --> 00:57:18.998
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:57:19.707 --> 00:57:20.833
Stop!

00:57:34.639 --> 00:57:36.099
What are you doing?

00:57:36.182 --> 00:57:37.559
You're here.

00:57:38.893 --> 00:57:42.355
I'm looking for the man
who nearly took your life.

00:57:42.855 --> 00:57:44.232
I already found him.

00:57:49.779 --> 00:57:51.281
He's standing in front of me.

00:58:01.583 --> 00:58:03.126
Say that again.

00:58:03.501 --> 00:58:04.877
All these tragedies

00:58:06.296 --> 00:58:08.172
began with Your Majesty.

00:58:31.154 --> 00:58:32.155
Say that again.

00:58:33.698 --> 00:58:35.074
It's Your Majesty's fault.

00:58:38.077 --> 00:58:38.911
Say that again.

00:58:38.995 --> 00:58:40.288
Your Majesty!

00:58:42.081 --> 00:58:43.249
It's your fault.

00:58:56.971 --> 00:58:58.097
Mother.

00:58:59.057 --> 00:58:59.974
What's the matter?

00:59:01.017 --> 00:59:02.268
Young Master…

00:59:08.149 --> 00:59:10.109
- What are you going to do?
- Let go of me.

00:59:10.693 --> 00:59:11.861
Just stay here.

00:59:11.944 --> 00:59:13.863
With no proof,
he'll be freed after the torture.

00:59:13.946 --> 00:59:15.448
Because of me--

00:59:16.157 --> 00:59:17.241
What's wrong?

00:59:30.963 --> 00:59:32.256
Hong Eun-jo!

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.727
That's the person you see?

01:00:02.453 --> 01:00:03.579
Young Master.

01:00:04.664 --> 01:00:06.374
This is the last time I'm asking.

01:00:07.166 --> 01:00:08.543
Say that again.

01:00:29.981 --> 01:00:31.607
Does this mean Hong Eun-jo is now…

01:00:35.361 --> 01:00:36.779
No.

01:01:17.487 --> 01:01:20.782
{\an8}There will be no more mistakes?

01:01:20.865 --> 01:01:21.741
{\an8}Who is it?

01:01:21.824 --> 01:01:24.452
{\an8}Who hid behind you and stood in my way?

01:01:24.535 --> 01:01:25.620
{\an8}Was it you?

01:01:26.162 --> 01:01:27.872
{\an8}Were you behind everything?

01:01:27.955 --> 01:01:29.373
{\an8}Don't take this the wrong way.

01:01:29.457 --> 01:01:31.959
{\an8}I just want to see
if my body is all right.

01:01:32.043 --> 01:01:35.338
{\an8}Why does everything
have to be so cruel to us?

01:01:35.421 --> 01:01:37.882
{\an8}Hong Min-jik's death
has shaken the ministers.

01:01:37.965 --> 01:01:40.134
{\an8}It seems like the decision has been made.

01:01:40.218 --> 01:01:42.970
{\an8}It was also the late king's wish.

01:01:43.054 --> 01:01:44.597
{\an8}You'll be in danger if you stay here.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.973
Let's run away.

01:01:46.641 --> 01:01:48.643
