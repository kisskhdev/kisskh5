00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:52.004
Fei Ni, you're back?

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.660
Mr. Zhou.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.970
Yeah.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.580
Fei Ni!

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.370
Lin Mei.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.620
(Lin Mei)

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.370
Let's go.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.610
Look.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.450
What's this?

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.220
No one visits a patient

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.170
and brings things back

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.330
from the hospital like you.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.450
He can't eat it, anyway,

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.137
so I brought it back
to let you try it.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.730
It's delicious.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.730
Let me show you something.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.540
This.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.490
Look.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.050
It's so big.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.270
How did you get this?

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.580
Stealing from the tiger's mouth.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.690
I took it from my house.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.020
This won't do. Take it back.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.560
Or your brother
and your sister-in-law

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.210
will devour you.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.160
It's fine.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.350
I still have this.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.800
I'm telling you.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.820
I've been secretly gathering
half a jin of meat tickets

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.950
and five jin of national grain tickets
in the last two months.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.050
Send these to your brother as well.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.690
You're so nice.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.140
All right.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.260
I'll go to the post office tomorrow.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.730
I'll send all of these to my brother,

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.100
so it won't take him too long

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.860
to get your gift full of love.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.540
He will never appreciate my effort.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.800
Did you two argue again?

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.350
Enough talk about us.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.490
Let me ask you.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.820
Well...

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.210
That...

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.730
Yang...

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.650
Fang Muyang.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.380
His name doesn't matter.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.470
Anyway, can you really attend university

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.190
if he wakes up?

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.810
It's not guaranteed,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.840
but there's a 90% chance, at least.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.350
As long as he can wake up,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.271
I'll be a winner
for the rest of my life.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.980
What if he doesn't wake up?

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.330
Knock on wood!

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.890
Touch wood.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.380
- Touch wood.
- Touch wood.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.930
He will surely wake up. Say it.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.930
Say it.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.100
He will surely wake up.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.890
He must wake up.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.210
Yes.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.619
If he dares to stay asleep,
I'll pinch him until he wakes up.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.210
Pinch him here.

00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:52.470
Stop!

00:03:53.982 --> 00:03:55.880
Tomorrow, both of us
will go and pinch him.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.330
No!

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.150
Pinch it here.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.650
- We'll pinch him here at the hospital.
- No!

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.770
Seriously,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.030
if that hero really does wake up,

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.950
you get to attend university,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.270
and your brother comes back
and we get married,

00:04:09.537 --> 00:04:11.440
isn't that three auspicious events
all at once?

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.760
That day will come.

I probed Ms. Liu thoroughly.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.530
It was chaotic that day.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.826
I don't think anyone noticed you.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.620

I'm not afraid.

We are officially in a relationship.

We will get married sooner or later.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.648
We are not married as long as we
still haven't obtained the certificate.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.620
If they see us sleeping together,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.090

I get it.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.540
In the end, it was because
your parents looked down on me

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.740
for being a normal factory worker

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.910
who was not a good match
for a university graduate like you.

00:07:57.915 --> 00:08:00.410
If we get married, there's
no need for us to act sneakily.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.530
So, before we get married,

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.871
you must get the quota from the factory
to recommend you to attend university.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.770
I'm not that capable.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:12.940
I still need to rely on you.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.260
Of course, I will help you.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.740
However, it's troublesome

00:08:17.782 --> 00:08:19.915
because the factory
only has one spot available.

00:08:20.137 --> 00:08:21.520
Fei Ni is also fighting for it.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.230

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:24.330
In the end,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.180
I'm just not as qualified as Fei Ni.

I'm sick of seeing
how self-righteous she is.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.040
She studies more than you, so what?

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:36.740
"Clarity"?

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.520
She just wants to embarrass me.

Fang Muyang, too.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.250
If he wakes up

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.050
and exposes us,

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:45.260
we'll be doomed.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.140
No.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.890
I must think of something

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.709
and make the factory

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.910
decide who gets the university spot
as soon as possible.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.570
When everything has been decided,

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.020

send him away immediately.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.426
You don't understand?

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:17.860
I'm only telling you

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.860
all these things

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.740
because you've been

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:21.410
taking care of him all these days

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:22.650
without slacking.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.140
A patient like Fang Muyang

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.260
will usually sleep for a few years

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.380
or even a few decades.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.382
In the past, the factory sent you here

00:12:32.404 --> 00:12:35.050
because he had no relatives
or friends to take care of him.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.220
Now that his girlfriend is here,

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.690
you should send him away.

00:12:43.071 --> 00:12:44.850
You're already tired
from taking care of him.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.530
(This is bad.)

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.760
(If Fang Muyang
doesn't need me anymore,)

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.150
(what will happen to my quota?)

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.140
(What about my university?)

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:05.770
Fei Ni,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.460
can I have a talk with you?

00:13:23.071 --> 00:13:25.590
I only found out he was injured
after reading the newspaper.

00:13:26.218 --> 00:13:27.188
I didn't expect him

00:13:28.137 --> 00:13:29.471
to be so seriously injured.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:32.510
Fang Muyang is a lot better now.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.930
Waking up

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.690
is just a matter of time.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.170
Are you from the same school
as Fang Muyang?

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.530
We were classmates for a year

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:47.890
in middle school.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.740
No wonder you look familiar.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.610
I heard the head nurse say

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.500
you've been the one
taking care of Fang Muyang.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.350
I thank you on behalf of Fang Muyang.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.220
(Is she going to shake my hand
and take over the duties from me?)

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.280
You're welcome.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:16.410
You...

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.140
(Don't say it.)

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.740
(Don't say that you no longer need me.)

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.570
(Don't say it...)

00:14:27.382 --> 00:14:29.204
How long can you take care of him?

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.460
Can I ask you to help me

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.810
take care of him for a while?

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.860
Since you were his classmates.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.182
No problem. I can take care of him
for as long as you need.

00:14:40.182 --> 00:14:40.782
No.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:42.770
I mean...

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.460
Fang Muyang is injured

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.248
because he saved our factory's worker.

00:14:46.248 --> 00:14:49.170
So, it's only right for me to take
care of him on behalf of the factory.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.570
That's great.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.780
I'll be leaving after I get my luggage.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.700
You're already leaving?

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.020
I just came back
from an interview abroad.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.170
I still need to write up an article
after I return to university.

00:15:02.182 --> 00:15:03.782
I'll come and visit him when I'm free.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:05.980
University?

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.060
Are you

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.610
enrolled in a university?

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:11.880
The production team had a spot

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.380
to enroll in the university last year.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.220
They...

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.340
They gave me the spot.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.650
Congratulations.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:34.570
Fei Ni,

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:35.620
what's going on?

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.937
Why did his girlfriend
leave with all her luggage?

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.530
She said she'd be back in a few days.

00:15:42.537 --> 00:15:44.650
It seems like
you'll be stuck here for a while.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.890
Zhou, do you have any other method

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.170
to let him wake up sooner?

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.530
I have no idea.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.340
Didn't the head nurse ask you

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.620
to chat more with him

00:15:59.170 --> 00:15:59.980
or let him

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.937
listen to some music
that he liked in the past?

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.140
Music?

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:04.690
It might be useful.

00:16:04.782 --> 00:16:06.100
What about revolutionary operas?

00:16:06.604 --> 00:16:08.004
As long as it has a tune.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.200
This is your father's treasure.

00:16:33.271 --> 00:16:35.170
It's difficult
to find this second-hand radio.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.080
Don't spoil it.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:37.710
Don't worry, Mom.

00:16:37.893 --> 00:16:39.604
It'll be around
as long as I'm still alive.

00:16:40.826 --> 00:16:42.160
You go to work at night

00:16:42.182 --> 00:16:44.226
and still need to go to the hospital
during the day.

00:16:44.226 --> 00:16:45.290
Can't you take a break?

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.050
Do you think you're made from steel?

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.650
We'll change shifts tomorrow.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.410
They want this batch of goods urgently.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.460
We need to rush it.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.620
If the delivery is delayed,

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.026
we'll have to pay a compensation.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.290
We still have food on the table.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.620
Do you think you have too much money?

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.740
Liu, who lives downstairs,

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.850
is also kind-hearted. She thinks

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:07.570
my daughter is very pretty

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:08.610
and needs a partner.

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:09.315
Coincidentally,

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.570
- the clothing factory has a man...
- Mom, I don't want a partner.

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:13.090
Just leave me alone.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.980
Having money is the most important.

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:19.460
Fine. Don't sleep too late.

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:30.290
Fang Muyang, this is enough.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.420
You've been lying here
for more than a month.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.493
If you don't wake up,
I'll stop taking care of you.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.110
I really owe you in my previous life.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.050
I'm not trying to scare you.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.420
If you don't wake up,

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.850
you'll even lose your girlfriend.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.260
She hasn't been here
since her last visit.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.940
I'm not trying to sow discord

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.050
but I just want to say

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.293
that it'll be good for both of us
if you wake up sooner.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.460
You listen to this play the whole day.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.570
My ears are going to burst from this.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.900
Any more and I will
be able to do the play myself.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.700
It's out of battery.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.370
You force me to do this.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.570
This is your book.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.660
I didn't want to do this

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.940
because it was too dangerous.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.130
Right now,

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.130
I have no other choice.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.740
I'll read a few pages for you.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.460
However, you mustn't report me
when you wake up.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.982
Otherwise, my role model will be gone.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:44.530
We hope beautiful lives
can keep spreading.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.460
That is how

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.230
the beautiful roses will forever exist.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.360
If mature things

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.360
must cease to exist in the world,

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.700
the beautiful descendants will
continue to spread fragrance.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.680
However, you are engaged
with the sparkling eyes of yours.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.760
Fei Ni, it's me. Open the door.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.180
Coming.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.460
Are you wiping him down?

00:20:28.004 --> 00:20:29.420
It's time to take your temperature.

00:20:36.804 --> 00:20:39.560
Why don't you take his temperature
after you finish wiping him down?

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:41.700
Sure.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.550
I'll help you close the door.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:47.190
Thank you.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.270
Fang Muyang, seriously.

00:20:55.293 --> 00:20:57.350
You're causing me trouble
even if you're lying here.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:09.090
Fei Ni!

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.050
Fei Ni!

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.480
Fei Ni!

00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:15.490
The shortlist of the factory's
recommended university candidates

00:21:15.493 --> 00:21:16.220
is announced!

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.580
Go and take a look!

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.204
(University shortlisted candidates)

00:21:36.226 --> 00:21:39.740
(Chen Guodong,
Zhang Xiangyang, Wang Defa)

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.620
(Study)

00:21:45.404 --> 00:21:46.740
Is everything ready over there?

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.937
Everything's ready, Ms. Xu.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:51.180
Ms. Xu, isn't it still early until the
beginning of the university semester?

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.940
Why is the name list released so soon?

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.420
Isn't it too early?

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.090
I also thought it was too early.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:58.130
However, Feng Lin was right.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.050
It's better to make a decision
on something so important earlier.

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:03.260
I haven't completed the assessment yet.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.850
What do you mean?

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.660
I mean...

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.940
I've been taking care of Fang Muyang,

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.090
so I didn't pay attention
to the factory...

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:15.980
Fei,

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.660
this is the right thing to do.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:20.570
Your most important task right now

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.940
is to take good care of Fang Muyang.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:24.980
Don't worry.

00:22:25.182 --> 00:22:27.360
You'll surely get your chance
in the future.

00:22:27.537 --> 00:22:28.460
You understand, right?

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:00.610
Fang Muyang,

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.660
do you understand
why I must attend university?

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.090
I'm sure you can't.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.090
Not even my parents can understand.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.700
They've been factory workers forever.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.360
They think there's nothing wrong
with being a factory worker.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:32.180
My brother

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.220
and Lin Mei

00:23:34.648 --> 00:23:35.900
can't understand as well.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.420
They think

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.740
there's no difference between
going to university and being a worker.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:46.700
But I know...

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:52.980
It's different.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.760
I like to read books.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.330
I like to write.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.050
But I know I'm still incapable.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.330
That is why I want to attend university.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.940
I want to read more books.
I want to learn how to write.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.570
I want to become an author
like Shakespeare.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:20.500
I dare not

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.210
say these things to other people.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.490
They will surely think
that I've gone mad.

00:24:32.626 --> 00:24:34.050
In order to attend university,

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:36.260
I'm willing to go through
all kinds of suffering.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.740
However, they just wouldn't let me go.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.790
I just don't get it.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.550
Why do people like Feng Lin,
who doesn't even know the term

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.940
that means pure and clear,

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.090
can attend university,

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:48.970
but I can't

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.870
even get a recommendation spot?

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.700
I didn't even dare to say that.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.420
Because Ms. Xu might say
that I'm not being humble.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:02.920
But

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.540
can I attend university
just by being humble?

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.380
If the college entrance examination
still exists,

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.230
I'll surely qualify for it,

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:22.110
but it no longer exists

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.270
so I can't decide my own fate.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.800
Fang Muyang, I'm not greedy at all.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:31.020
I just

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.610
don't want

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:34.315
to live every day of my life
knowing what will happen at the end.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.250
I beg you.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:41.248
Wake up.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.680
Why are you crying?

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:20.130
Fang Muyang,

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:24.090
you're awake.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:25.880
Fang Muyang.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.570
Who are you?

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.530
I am Fei Ni.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.980
Fei Ni.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.700
Fei Ni.

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.020
Fei Ni.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.780
(Inpatient Department)

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:00.220
We will only know

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.570
the detailed results
after his brain scan is completed.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.700
However, from his reaction,

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.740
the blood clot in the brain

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.160
seems to be absorbing quite well.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.370
Moreover, his motor functions

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:09.382
seem to be working well.

00:27:09.382 --> 00:27:10.850
Thank you, Dr. Liang.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.290
Fang Muyang,

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:13.700
while you were in a coma,

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.420
Fei Ni had been
the one taking care of you.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:17.050
It's all thanks to her

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.293
that you can wake up so soon.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.130
- Yes.
- You need to thank her well.

00:27:20.982 --> 00:27:21.950
What is this place?

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:23.610
This...

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.500
This is the hospital.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.050
You saved someone
and got injured because of it.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.590
Don't you remember?

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.050
Do you still remember what your name is

00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:36.382
and where you come from?

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.740
(Jiangcheng Worker-Peasant Hospital)

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:58.260
Fang Muyang,

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.090
not only are you a morally noble person,

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.610
but you are also a resolute person.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.248
All of Jiangcheng No. 1 Textile Factory

00:28:06.315 --> 00:28:08.500
are happy to see you out of the coma.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.770
Does he not remember anything,

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:10.740
including his name,

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.460
where he lives,

00:28:11.537 --> 00:28:12.620
and who his parents are?

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:15.090
Dr. Liang says

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.290
he is suffering from retrograde amnesia

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.980
resulting from a moderate
closed traumatic brain injury.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.330
It means

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.940
he has forgotten
his basic living capabilities.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.940
Doesn't that mean
he has turned into an idiot?

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.530
Such a handsome idiot. What a pity.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:32.260
How is he an idiot?

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.330
Dr. Liang said

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.940
he needs time

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.260
to recover slowly.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.050
For how long?

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.740
I don't know.

00:28:42.026 --> 00:28:43.493
It's the same as saying nothing.

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.840
Hold on.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:49.740
Does it mean he has forgotten

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.080
about you taking care of him?

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:52.560
You've lost out on so much, then.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:55.820
I just need Ms. Xu to remember.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:02.740
Fang Muyang,

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.720
do you still remember me?

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.970
Fei Ni?

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.940
I am not Fei Ni.

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.080
You saved me.

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:15.340
Do you not remember?

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.260
It's fine.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.130
Fang Muyang,

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.330
I contacted your mill.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.940
You are a model individual over there.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.740
An example that everyone can learn from.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.810
If you have any problems in the future,

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:35.420
you can come to me.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:37.900
Fei Ni.

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.610
Of course.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:42.970
Fei Ni, as well.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:44.810
Fei Ni,

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.700
you've worked hard.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:47.770
Fang Muyang

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.700
kept mentioning your name just now.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.360
It's obvious that you've spent
a lot of effort during this period.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.180
Not at all, Ms. Xu.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.020
I've decided

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.530
to get someone

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.180
to write both of your stories

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.330
after he recovers completely.

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.660
I will report it
in front of every employee

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.248
before making a report to the superior.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.300
I also want to call

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.560
every worker
from every industry and system

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.160
to learn from both of you.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.600
When the time comes,
not only the role model in the factory,

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.080
but I'll also recommend you

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.630
to become the whole city's role model.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.330
Ms. Xu, there's no need.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.900
I understand.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.050
Taking care of a patient like this

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:25.810
is hard work.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:26.700
Don't worry.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.330
I can see the effort you've put in.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.510
The factory's superior sees it too.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.090
When you become the city's role model,

00:30:34.182 --> 00:30:36.160
you'll be able
to attend any university you want.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:38.900
Really?

00:30:41.137 --> 00:30:42.980
Thank you for
your recognition, Ms. Xu.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:47.940
Of course, he must
make a full recovery first.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.810
Don't worry, Ms. Xu.

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:52.700
I will never give up halfway.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.660
I will surely
take good care of Fang Muyang

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.570
and see that he makes a full recovery.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.090
Then, I'll leave him to you.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.530
Don't worry.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:09.330
What did Ms. Xu mean?

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:12.130
She means

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.810
if Fang Muyang
can have his memory restored,

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:17.810
I will have a chance
to attend university!

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.200
You drew this whole book.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.360
Take a good look.

00:31:32.626 --> 00:31:33.850
Stop adjusting the dial.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:38.770
Look at this. A lumber mill.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:39.850
Look.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.330
Look at this crane.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:45.471
I'm sure you remember this.

00:31:45.493 --> 00:31:46.180
I don't.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:48.420
This.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.260
Is this Ling Yi? Take a good look.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:51.500
I don't know.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.530
Ling Yi.

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:54.330
Right?

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:55.260
Take a good look.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:57.500
This...

00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:59.090
Take a look.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:01.471
Do you remember them?

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:02.990
They are your colleagues.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.080
Can you remember?

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.260
I don't remember. I don't know.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:16.250
Eat this.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.400
The doctor says
it's good for your brain.

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:31.660
Fang Muyang,

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.610
why do you always look at the watch?

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.660
Does it mean something special?

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:42.740
Was it given to you by your parents

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.570
or your grandmother?

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:55.790
Keep eating.

00:33:02.537 --> 00:33:04.582
Two sticks a day.
One in the morning, one at night.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.650
Do you still remember this?

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:18.630
You sold it to me for 1.5 yuan

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:20.820
at the canola field.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:22.660
Open it.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.250
A book by Shakespeare.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.430
You could even recite his "Sonnet 14".

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:39.940
Didn't you learn how to draw?

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.020
You collected all these
famous paintings from around the world.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:16.800
It's good for restoring your memory.

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:21.330
Eat.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.430
Take a big bite.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:47.780
Help!

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.610
The house is collapsing!

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:59.460
Ms. Liu, who saved you?

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:03.170
It's that young man. Thank you.

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:08.820
It's all right.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.500
Everyone, wake everyone up!

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.980
Stop sleeping!

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.340
It will collapse again!

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:17.460
Wake everyone up! Stop sleeping!

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.030
Mom, I'm scared.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.230
What should we do?

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.170
The tree is going to fall on the house!

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:29.530
Who is it? It's still that young man!

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.500
He has already saved four people.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.980
Four people!

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.570
Do you remember?

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:44.610
Fang Muyang,

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:48.900
I've been waiting for this weather

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.650
for half a month.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:52.650
I heard my father say

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.300
the weather was similar that night.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.980
There was a heavy storm.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:57.980
You saved three people.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.940
Then, the house collapsed

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:00.980
and the tree fell.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.610
You ran inside quickly.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:08.130
What next?

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:11.500
After that, you were lying here.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.170
I don't remember.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:22.530
It's all right.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:24.980
I'll keep thinking.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.710
There must be other ways.

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:39.760
Fei Ni.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.137
I will work hard.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:54.860
That's good enough.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:04.980
(Jiangcheng Worker-Peasant Hospital)

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:13.490
What is he doing?

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:14.890
Playing the piano.

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:16.404
He has been playing it for days.

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:17.870
Playing the piano?

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.420
You are an expert in piano.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.780
Go and teach him.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:23.300
Stop teasing me.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.120
How has he been recently?

00:37:27.137 --> 00:37:28.620
Has his memory recovered a little?

00:37:31.693 --> 00:37:33.070
Are you sure you want to do this?

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:34.890
Taking care of an idiot

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.200
is harder than taking care
of a patient in a coma.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:38.570
I'll say it again.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.200
He's not an idiot.
He just forgets things.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.230
You are right.

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:44.490
He is not an idiot.

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:45.950
You are the idiot.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.100
Fei Ni,

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:49.960
you must listen to me this time.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.310
This is a trap.
Stop sinking deeper into it.

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.160
Ms. Xu said

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:58.860
that if I can take good care of him,

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:00.782
she will recommend me
to attend university.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:02.450
I can't just give up so easily.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.170
What if he can't recover?

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.280
Well,

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.650
people also said he couldn't wake up

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:09.210
but he still woke up.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.370
Fei Ni, if you can't do it this year,
there's always next year.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.730
If you can't do it next year,
there's always the year after next.

00:38:17.737 --> 00:38:19.826
This is not the only way
to attend university.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.780
Lin Mei,

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:26.670
you know. I...

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.160
I've been working hard for three years.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:31.540
I know very well

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.310
that every failure

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:35.300
makes me less determined.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.650
I don't know if I still have the courage
to fight for it next year.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.210
I don't want to see my determination

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.860
being worn away little by little.

00:38:45.004 --> 00:38:46.448
Do you think I don't know you?

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:47.980
You will

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:50.240
only give up when you hit a wall.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:51.520
No.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.210
You won't give up
even if you hit a wall.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:58.000
Who knows
when he will regain his memory?

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:00.740
Oh,

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:03.570
doesn't he have
any relatives or friends?

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.250
He does have one.

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:12.740
Perhaps it might work if she's here.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:17.780
Where is he?

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.030
Fei Ni.

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:26.170
You're still smiling?

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:28.570
You're an adult, but you can't even
tie your own shoelaces.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:29.226
Come here.

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:36.190
Just leave it here.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:38.080
Squat down.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.090
It might be hard,
but you still need to learn it.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:43.630
Tie a knot.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:45.640
Make it into a circle.

00:39:46.404 --> 00:39:48.648
Why are you looking at me?
Look at your shoes.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:51.650
Turn it around.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:52.860
Tie it tightly.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.830
He might be a fool,

00:39:54.848 --> 00:39:56.360
but he's easy to take care of.

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:11.500
Fang Muyang.

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:23.820
You're here.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:28.900
Ling Yi.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.090
She's here to see you.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:32.780
Quick. Take a good look at her.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:34.650
Can you remember anything?

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.020
Fang Muyang,

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:38.090
have you really forgotten about me?

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.070
I am Ling Yi...

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.648
Stop wasting your energy.

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:49.430
He doesn't even remember me.

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:50.340
(Fang Mujing)

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:53.120
Jing, you're here too.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.780
You must be Fei Ni.

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.500
Hello, I am Fang Mujing.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.080
I am Fang Muyang's sister.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.540
Hello, Mujing.

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.360
Fei Ni.

00:41:27.715 --> 00:41:29.737
Thank you
for taking care of Fang Muyang.

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:31.780
You don't have to thank me.

00:41:31.804 --> 00:41:34.840
Taking care of him is a task given to me
by Jiangcheng No. 1 Textile Factory.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:38.830
Thank you for still visiting him.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.990
Jing, you don't need
to be so polite to me.

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:45.740
I had a chat with Dr. Liang.

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:47.440
Right now, Fang Muyang

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:49.320
lacks the ability to live on his own.

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.860
Most importantly,

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.220
no one knows when he will recover

00:41:53.226 --> 00:41:54.826
or whether he will even recover.

00:41:54.826 --> 00:41:56.582
He needs someone to take care of him.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.089
However, in Jiangcheng,

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.204
there's no one in my family
who can take care of him.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:01.540
So, I've decided

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:02.740
to send him

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.010
to a rehabilitation center
in my hometown tomorrow.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:10.880
Why?

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:12.210
I can take care of him.

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:13.510
How long can you do that for?

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:15.460
A month?

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.370
Two months?

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.000
Or half a year to a year?

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.460
If he can't recover
in three to five years,

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:22.190
can you take care of him forever?

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.650
But the rehabilitation center
in the hometown isn't good enough.

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:29.520
That's a given.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.440
But if he stays here,

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:36.210
the No. 1 Textile Factory
or Educated Youth Office

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:37.830
won't keep taking care of him.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:39.700
Or

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.200
can you take care of him
in my place forever?

00:42:45.404 --> 00:42:46.170
Speaking of which,

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:48.420
if he hadn't given you
his university quota,

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.071
he might not even get hurt.

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.920
Just think of it as repaying him.
Can you do that?

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:02.820
If you can't keep taking care of him

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.410
until he recovers,

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.510
I'll make the decision.

00:43:07.004 --> 00:43:08.400
I only applied for four days off.

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:10.290
I'll leave on the morning
of the day after tomorrow.

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:13.020
Tomorrow, I'll come here
and process his discharge.
