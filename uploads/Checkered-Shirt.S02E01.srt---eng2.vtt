00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:15.890
I told you I was sorry.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.975
For what?

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:18.768
For spreading rumors that

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:19.811
I was stalking you unilaterally, Sunbae?

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.187
Or...

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.981
For ghosting me out of nowhere?

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:25.233
Hey, back then...

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:27.694
I told you I did it because I was scared.

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.572
Our photo got posted on the campus app, so...

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.450
I'm sorry.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.535
Please forgive me.

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:39.330
I won't ever...

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:42.667
Don't come looking for me again.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.795
Hey!

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.218
You think Park Jeong-woo won't be like that?

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:54.763
When things get disadvantageous, it's human instinct

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:56.514
to hide and cut ties to save one's own skin.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.267
You think he's any different?

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.186
That jerk is probably exactly the same.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:07.108
That person...

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:09.819
is different from you.

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.745
It's a bit awkward to do introductions right now,

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.455
so I'll have to ask first,

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:21.956
and I'll introduce you later.

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:23.541
Ask first?

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.001
Wow, look at this guy.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.836
He said he couldn't even breathe in front of Min-ji,

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:28.254
but look at him now acting all mighty.

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:30.924
Tell me about it.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:33.676
Hey.

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:34.803
Still,

00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:38.181
how about keeping some distance from Lee Han-gyul?

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.850
What are you talking about?

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.774
Min-ji saw a post on the campus app the other day.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.776
He was already famous at that college.

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:51.069
Something about his "preferences,"

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.404
or that he goes around sleeping with everyone.

00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:57.033
So I'm telling you to be careful.

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:59.828
Be careful of what?

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.121
Jeong-woo.

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.706
I know you care a lot about Han-gyul,

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:05.166
but you have to go to the army soon.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.418
What are you going to do if weird rumors start spreading?

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.379
In human relationships, if you cross one bridge,

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.089
everyone knows everyone.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.965
Hey, Moon Jae-seop.

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:14.551
What?

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:17.887
Don't speak carelessly about people you haven't experienced yourself.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:46.226
Did I wake you?

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.314
No.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.157
What's this scratch?

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:03.660
Ah...

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:05.912
Well...

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.874
I had a little tussle with a cat with a nasty temper.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.181
Tell me what it looked like.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.016
I'll get revenge for you.

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:30.436
It's okay.

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:40.363
Hyung.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.616
Do you like being with me like this?

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.743
Of course I do.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.165
Suddenly...

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:52.709
What if I disappear?

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.630
I'll be by your side no matter what.

00:04:58.506 --> 00:04:59.674
Always.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.518
Hello?

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.604
This is Park Jeong-woo's phone, right?

00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:38.815
Who is this?

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:41.692
I'm Lee Han-gyul's ex-boyfriend.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.111
Regarding Lee Han-gyul,

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:45.113
are you dating him knowing what he's really like?
