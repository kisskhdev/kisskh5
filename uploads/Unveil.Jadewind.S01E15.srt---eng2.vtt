{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:37.385
CURSED TALENT

00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:40.665
Forgive my incompetence.
Consort Li passed away.

00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:43.825
But she had just been cured.

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:45.065
How did she die so suddenly?

00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:47.345
Consort Li died of poisoning.

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:49.585
Someone poisoned her?

00:01:49.665 --> 00:01:52.305
She didn't die from sudden poisoning.

00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:53.305
It was chronic.

00:01:54.345 --> 00:01:56.385
I checked carefully.

00:01:56.465 --> 00:01:58.425
Her fingertips were purple.

00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:00.105
Her eyelids turned white.

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:02.345
Those are signs of chronic poisoning.

00:02:02.425 --> 00:02:06.185
Who dared to poison Consort Li?

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:08.864
We checked everything.

00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:13.025
Consort Li's rouge, lip balm, clothes,
food, and drinks were not poisonous.

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:15.465
What substance poisoned Consort Li,

00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:17.865
and who administered it,
remains to be investigated.

00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:26.945
Won't you light the lamp?

00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:30.105
Understood.
I'll send someone to get a candle.

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:31.065
Wait.

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:39.385
Did Consort Li prefer the darkness?

00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:40.505
Yes.

00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:42.785
She never lit the lamp in her chamber.

00:02:42.865 --> 00:02:44.065
Why not?

00:02:44.785 --> 00:02:47.065
- For her facial skin.
- That's right.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:55.065
This is the "Jade Dust Face Cream"
from Essential Prescriptions,

00:02:55.585 --> 00:02:56.785
which brightens the complexion.

00:02:57.585 --> 00:02:58.865
Consort Li was 37

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:02.545
but still had fair skin and rosy cheeks
like a young maiden.

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:04.425
I bet she paid
great attention to skin care.

00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:06.505
Your Ladyship is observant.

00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:10.265
Perfumed lip balm.

00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:13.585
Angelica root powder.

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:17.625
Consort Li was such an expert
in skin care.

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:20.105
Take everything back for inspection.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:22.305
- Understood.
- Be careful.

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:23.945
The pots may contain toxins, too.

00:03:40.985 --> 00:03:41.945
These are…

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:46.265
The physicians have always
prescribed decoctions,

00:03:46.345 --> 00:03:47.945
never pills.

00:03:48.025 --> 00:03:51.225
Pills made by the Imperial Medical Office
have a red mark on glutinous rice paper.

00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:52.625
Well…

00:03:53.425 --> 00:03:54.305
They're privately-made.

00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:57.145
Someone in the Imperial Medical Office
killed Her Highness?

00:04:04.185 --> 00:04:05.305
No need to check these.

00:04:06.185 --> 00:04:07.865
- What if we miss something?
- No way.

00:04:09.305 --> 00:04:10.545
Any update on the pills?

00:04:11.705 --> 00:04:12.545
Non-toxic.

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:14.985
They smell like Free and Easy Pills.

00:04:15.065 --> 00:04:16.545
But I'm afraid only the pill maker

00:04:16.624 --> 00:04:19.665
can tell us what herbs the pills contain.

00:04:20.384 --> 00:04:21.465
Your Ladyship. I found something.

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:25.065
Ten days ago, Pei Yu
from the Medical Office

00:04:25.145 --> 00:04:26.545
took Consort Li's pulse.

00:04:27.065 --> 00:04:28.105
She's a female technician.

00:04:29.385 --> 00:04:30.265
Let's talk to her.

00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:32.705
Just listen to Mr. Xiao.

00:04:35.505 --> 00:04:36.345
Lady Wuren.

00:04:38.665 --> 00:04:41.745
Mr. Xiao said to check only these few.

00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:43.825
Do you know why?

00:04:51.705 --> 00:04:53.305
Consort Li's palace was too dark.

00:04:53.385 --> 00:04:55.025
Otherwise, we wouldn't have
brought all these.

00:04:55.105 --> 00:04:56.585
It's dry in autumn.

00:04:57.105 --> 00:04:58.665
These balms have dried out.

00:04:58.745 --> 00:05:00.265
They haven't been used for a long time.

00:05:00.865 --> 00:05:02.465
Consort Li only recovered
half a month ago.

00:05:02.545 --> 00:05:05.625
I don't think she used any rouge,
lip balm, or face powder.

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:07.465
Symptoms emerged on the day
of the autumn equinox.

00:05:07.545 --> 00:05:10.145
Clearly, the poison
didn't come from these.

00:05:12.585 --> 00:05:16.905
These balms look moist and dented.
They must have been used daily.

00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:20.225
That's impressive.

00:05:22.745 --> 00:05:23.745
Where is Technician Pei?

00:05:24.745 --> 00:05:25.745
She's in there.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:28.025
Physician Song is making
her copy the medical books.

00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:36.385
Technician Pei
doesn't seem to be well-liked.

00:05:46.865 --> 00:05:48.065
The ink is not dry yet.

00:06:00.945 --> 00:06:02.145
I didn't sleep well,
and I'm in a bad mood.

00:06:02.225 --> 00:06:03.625
You'd better not ask for trouble.

00:06:03.705 --> 00:06:05.865
- I didn't kill anyone.
- Then why did you run?

00:06:05.945 --> 00:06:08.265
I want to find out what killed Consort Li.

00:06:08.345 --> 00:06:09.185
I want to find the killer.

00:06:09.265 --> 00:06:10.825
No more nonsense. Come down.

00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:11.825
Pei Yu.

00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:13.065
Listen to Her Ladyship.

00:06:13.145 --> 00:06:14.185
Come down.

00:06:15.025 --> 00:06:16.025
Otherwise…

00:06:16.665 --> 00:06:18.345
No! I worked on those all night.

00:06:23.105 --> 00:06:24.705
You've become mischievous.

00:06:27.465 --> 00:06:28.545
Here's the prescription.

00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:31.305
I used the best medicinal materials
to perfect the skin.

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:33.025
It works better
than the Free and Easy Pill

00:06:33.105 --> 00:06:34.265
in the Essential Prescriptions.

00:06:34.345 --> 00:06:35.185
You can look it up.

00:06:35.265 --> 00:06:38.545
Withholding information
will lead to harsher penalties.

00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:40.345
Why would I hide anything?

00:06:40.425 --> 00:06:42.625
This pill is not so effective
with any slight changes.

00:06:44.105 --> 00:06:46.905
The Imperial Medical Office prohibits
private prescriptions,

00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:48.745
especially from female technicians.

00:06:49.265 --> 00:06:51.545
You didn't just give prescriptions.
You even made pills.

00:06:51.625 --> 00:06:54.865
If Consort Li hadn't passed away,
how long did you plan to hide it?

00:06:54.945 --> 00:06:56.545
Of course, I'd try to hide it.

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:58.545
You offered to make pills for her?

00:06:59.465 --> 00:07:00.505
She asked me to do it.

00:07:01.105 --> 00:07:03.065
- No way.
- Why would I lie?

00:07:03.665 --> 00:07:06.345
I adjusted the dosage
of several decoctions for her.

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:07.305
The effect was pronounced.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.025
She appreciated my talent

00:07:09.105 --> 00:07:11.385
and sought my advice
privately several times.

00:07:11.465 --> 00:07:12.385
Everything worked well.

00:07:13.505 --> 00:07:15.865
She knew that female technicians
can't give prescriptions.

00:07:16.465 --> 00:07:18.785
But she trusted me. It was our secret.

00:07:18.865 --> 00:07:20.705
You prescribed her other medicines?

00:07:21.385 --> 00:07:23.185
I only adjusted the dosage.

00:07:23.785 --> 00:07:27.665
She looked haggard after the recovery
and wasn't as pretty as before.

00:07:28.265 --> 00:07:29.145
So she asked me

00:07:29.225 --> 00:07:31.625
to make some pills
to brighten her complexion.

00:07:32.265 --> 00:07:34.425
But that wasn't the cause of her death.

00:07:35.385 --> 00:07:37.905
Your Ladyship.
Take me to see Consort Li's body.

00:07:41.265 --> 00:07:42.305
You're a suspect.

00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:44.705
But I need to know how she died

00:07:44.785 --> 00:07:46.905
to figure out if it's related to the pill.

00:07:55.825 --> 00:07:57.025
WHILE DRINKING, CONSORT LI FELT DIZZY
AND SHORT OF BREATH. HER FACE TURNED PALE

00:07:57.745 --> 00:07:59.505
She felt dizzy and short of breath?

00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:00.945
Also vomiting blood.

00:08:02.505 --> 00:08:03.425
No way.

00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:06.425
An overdose of the safflower
and gleditsia spines

00:08:06.505 --> 00:08:09.505
in the prescription can be toxic.

00:08:09.585 --> 00:08:11.385
But it wouldn't make her vomit blood.

00:08:11.465 --> 00:08:15.985
Consort Li showed symptoms of poisoning
when she started taking pills.

00:08:16.065 --> 00:08:17.025
It can't be a coincidence.

00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:25.105
It's ginseng.

00:08:25.945 --> 00:08:27.585
There is a small amount
of veratrum in the pill.

00:08:27.665 --> 00:08:30.105
If consumed with ginseng,
it creates toxins.

00:08:30.185 --> 00:08:32.585
If Consort Li really died from this pill,

00:08:33.425 --> 00:08:34.904
that's the only explanation.

00:08:40.745 --> 00:08:42.345
Her Highness never had ginseng.

00:08:42.425 --> 00:08:44.705
But the old lady
felt sorry for her relapse

00:08:44.785 --> 00:08:47.545
and sent her some top-quality ginseng
as a supplement.

00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:50.385
The old lady chopped it up
and made it into candy

00:08:50.465 --> 00:08:53.425
with shredded ginger
in case Her Highness wouldn't have it.

00:08:53.505 --> 00:08:56.705
Shredded ginger and ginseng
look pretty much the same.

00:08:56.785 --> 00:08:59.745
But the strong taste of ginger
suppresses the taste of ginseng.

00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:04.985
Who else helped her make the candy?

00:09:06.265 --> 00:09:07.505
The old lady loved Her Highness.

00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:09.745
She picked the material
and made the candy all by herself.

00:09:09.825 --> 00:09:12.105
Even after Her Highness
entered the palace,

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:14.985
it remained that way
for more than ten years.

00:09:17.305 --> 00:09:18.705
ZICHEN HALL

00:09:18.785 --> 00:09:21.305
The pills Consort Li took
for her complexion are non-toxic.

00:09:21.385 --> 00:09:24.105
The ginseng candy Madam Zheng made
for her was also non-toxic.

00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:26.585
But the veratrum in the pill
works against ginseng.

00:09:26.665 --> 00:09:29.065
Her Highness slowly
got poisoned like that.

00:09:29.145 --> 00:09:30.705
How could she be so careless?

00:09:30.785 --> 00:09:32.585
She wasn't even having ginseng.

00:09:33.265 --> 00:09:36.265
But Madam Zheng was eager
to boost Consort Li's health

00:09:36.345 --> 00:09:39.345
and mixed ginseng
into the ginger candy she was having.

00:09:39.945 --> 00:09:41.465
Consort Li had no idea.

00:09:46.825 --> 00:09:49.505
After all, it's my fault. I was negligent

00:09:49.585 --> 00:09:51.305
and didn't know that Pei Yu

00:09:51.385 --> 00:09:53.865
was secretly making pills
for Her Highness,

00:09:53.945 --> 00:09:55.185
which led to the tragedy.

00:09:55.265 --> 00:09:58.265
It is my sole responsibility.

00:09:58.785 --> 00:10:01.225
I deserve punishment.

00:10:02.065 --> 00:10:04.785
It does violate the rules
for a female technician

00:10:05.385 --> 00:10:06.545
to make pills in private.

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:09.625
As the Imperial Physician,
you didn't notice anything.

00:10:09.705 --> 00:10:11.585
I sincerely apologize.

00:10:11.665 --> 00:10:13.105
I deserve punishment.

00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:16.265
Your Majesty, please give me a chance

00:10:16.345 --> 00:10:19.865
to punish my subordinate
and discipline her.

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:23.145
Consort Li's death was an accident.

00:10:23.865 --> 00:10:26.625
But the Zheng family deserves an apology.

00:10:26.705 --> 00:10:28.945
You will be fined three months of wage.

00:10:29.025 --> 00:10:32.745
Decide for yourself how to punish
your subordinate.

00:10:34.745 --> 00:10:37.345
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:10:42.385 --> 00:10:44.985
Just now, you asked
His Majesty for punishment

00:10:45.065 --> 00:10:46.505
but kept defending Pei Yu.

00:10:47.025 --> 00:10:49.225
Naturally, His Majesty understood you.

00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:51.945
His Majesty is magnanimous.

00:10:52.865 --> 00:10:53.825
In the end,

00:10:53.905 --> 00:10:54.785
the tragedy happened

00:10:54.865 --> 00:10:57.745
because Pei Yu gave Her Highness
a prescription.

00:10:57.825 --> 00:10:59.705
If His Majesty wants to punish her,

00:10:59.785 --> 00:11:03.385
I can't protect her
as a mere Imperial Physician.

00:11:03.465 --> 00:11:07.305
She must be quite something
to make you take such a risk.

00:11:08.905 --> 00:11:11.505
This child is my lucky star.

00:11:12.585 --> 00:11:15.025
Many years ago, I traveled the world
to seek prescriptions.

00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:17.905
Pei Yu may have grown up
in the countryside,

00:11:17.985 --> 00:11:20.425
but she is quite talented in medicine.

00:11:20.505 --> 00:11:24.225
Her prescriptions
solved my problem at hand.

00:11:24.905 --> 00:11:26.345
She was all by herself.

00:11:26.425 --> 00:11:28.545
So I just brought her back
to the Imperial Medical Office.

00:11:29.225 --> 00:11:31.665
Despite her rough disposition
and lack of discipline,

00:11:31.745 --> 00:11:34.745
she is talented and intelligent
and makes rapid progress.

00:11:35.545 --> 00:11:38.625
If she were a man,
she'd be well-recognized now.

00:11:57.665 --> 00:11:59.145
Pei Yu, get up.

00:12:00.785 --> 00:12:03.465
Your master came to pick you up.
You can go now.

00:12:03.545 --> 00:12:05.305
Be quiet. I'm busy.

00:12:08.945 --> 00:12:10.385
You only shed tears
when the coffin is in sight.

00:12:10.465 --> 00:12:12.145
Don't you know where you are?

00:12:12.745 --> 00:12:14.025
How do you know I didn't shed tears?

00:12:14.105 --> 00:12:15.505
But what's the point?

00:12:15.585 --> 00:12:17.585
I have to find a replacement for veratrum

00:12:17.665 --> 00:12:19.385
so the pill doesn't work against ginseng.

00:12:22.105 --> 00:12:24.465
Get up now. The county princess is here.

00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:26.705
Go ahead if you're busy.

00:12:26.785 --> 00:12:27.745
I'm fine here.

00:12:31.825 --> 00:12:32.665
Your Ladyship.

00:12:32.745 --> 00:12:35.065
She doesn't mean to offend you.

00:12:35.145 --> 00:12:36.385
It's alright.

00:12:36.465 --> 00:12:39.225
Our prison is empty, anyway.

00:12:45.985 --> 00:12:49.185
If you don't come with us now,
I'll ground you once we go back.

00:12:49.265 --> 00:12:51.705
I will never let you
in the dispensary again.

00:13:05.105 --> 00:13:06.465
I heard people arguing

00:13:06.545 --> 00:13:09.025
and thought it was Inspector Du
arguing with you.

00:13:09.785 --> 00:13:11.105
Pei Yu is quite interesting.

00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:13.745
I used to be absorbed
in case files as a kid.

00:13:13.825 --> 00:13:15.345
The old man couldn't do anything, either.

00:13:15.425 --> 00:13:17.385
Aren't you just the same?

00:13:18.185 --> 00:13:19.585
- What?
- Nothing.

00:13:20.185 --> 00:13:22.905
I mean, I didn't expect
that it was a simple case.

00:13:22.985 --> 00:13:25.305
Consort Li was worried about aging
and losing His Majesty's love.

00:13:25.385 --> 00:13:27.745
Madam Zheng was concerned
about her daughter's health.

00:13:27.825 --> 00:13:30.585
Such earnest intentions
have yielded only bitter fruit.

00:13:30.665 --> 00:13:32.865
I feel sorry for Madam Zheng.

00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:35.145
She might be tortured by this forever.

00:13:40.505 --> 00:13:41.985
I'm done with the copying.

00:13:42.065 --> 00:13:44.585
Master. Can you find me
another book next time?

00:13:44.665 --> 00:13:46.105
I'm tired of copying this one.

00:13:47.825 --> 00:13:48.865
Your master is so kind to you.

00:13:49.545 --> 00:13:50.825
He only made you copy books.

00:13:52.225 --> 00:13:53.145
Don't touch it.

00:13:55.105 --> 00:13:57.585
Working while reading? So half-hearted.

00:13:57.665 --> 00:13:59.465
If you make a mistake and kill someone,

00:13:59.545 --> 00:14:00.865
your master can't save you.

00:14:00.945 --> 00:14:02.065
No way.

00:14:02.145 --> 00:14:03.905
All these herbs feel and smell different.

00:14:03.985 --> 00:14:06.465
And I know every drawer
of the cabinet by heart.

00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:07.665
I won't make any mistakes.

00:14:11.305 --> 00:14:12.345
Are you here for me?

00:14:12.425 --> 00:14:14.105
I haven't prescribed anything again.

00:14:15.185 --> 00:14:16.745
I'm here to consult with you.

00:14:17.265 --> 00:14:19.825
Among the cases I've heard of
and dealt with,

00:14:19.905 --> 00:14:22.425
very few people killed someone
by combining two herbs

00:14:22.505 --> 00:14:23.465
that work against each other.

00:14:24.345 --> 00:14:26.905
Because only the top practitioners
possess the knowledge.

00:14:27.585 --> 00:14:28.425
But sometimes,

00:14:28.505 --> 00:14:30.665
even if the two herbs are incompatible,

00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:32.985
it doesn't become toxic
with an insignificant dose.

00:14:34.145 --> 00:14:36.265
Interesting. Can you teach me?

00:14:40.185 --> 00:14:41.865
I compiled this manual
from ancient prescriptions

00:14:41.945 --> 00:14:42.865
and medical books.

00:14:42.945 --> 00:14:44.065
You can read it.

00:14:51.865 --> 00:14:52.945
Pei Yu.

00:14:54.465 --> 00:14:56.825
Get three medicines
based on this prescription.

00:14:59.545 --> 00:15:01.985
There have been several cases
of colds in the palace

00:15:02.065 --> 00:15:03.345
with similar symptoms.

00:15:03.425 --> 00:15:04.025
HUANG FUTONG MEDICAL SUPERVISOR

00:15:04.105 --> 00:15:06.385
Aversion to cold. Persistent low fever.

00:15:06.465 --> 00:15:07.305
Stuffy noses and retching.

00:15:07.385 --> 00:15:09.265
It's autumn,

00:15:09.345 --> 00:15:11.065
hot at noon and cold at night.

00:15:11.145 --> 00:15:13.265
It's the season for such an outbreak.

00:15:14.985 --> 00:15:17.785
Ask the palace maids to prepare
some cinnamon twig decoction

00:15:17.865 --> 00:15:19.505
for preventative reasons.

00:15:20.585 --> 00:15:21.705
Good idea.

00:15:21.785 --> 00:15:24.185
The cinnamon twig decoction
is not for those who don't sweat.

00:15:24.785 --> 00:15:26.145
Cinnamon twig relieves muscles.

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:27.785
If the patient
has a fever without sweating

00:15:27.865 --> 00:15:29.225
and has a tight pulse,

00:15:29.305 --> 00:15:31.345
the cinnamon twig
will only make things worse.

00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:34.305
Supervisor Huang.
How long have they been ill?

00:15:34.385 --> 00:15:36.785
Did they develop diarrhea
or stuffy breath?

00:15:36.865 --> 00:15:38.945
Find the herbs
according to the prescription.

00:15:39.025 --> 00:15:41.145
But I overheard the symptoms.

00:15:41.225 --> 00:15:43.665
I'm afraid it's not just a cold,

00:15:43.745 --> 00:15:45.905
but an epidemic
that tends to occur in early autumn.

00:15:45.985 --> 00:15:47.305
I have read it in a book.

00:15:47.385 --> 00:15:50.185
Find the herbs and boil
the medicine as soon as possible.

00:15:50.265 --> 00:15:52.225
Don't waste our time.

00:15:53.065 --> 00:15:53.945
Find the herbs.

00:15:57.065 --> 00:16:00.545
How dare a little errand girl
tell us what to do?

00:16:00.625 --> 00:16:01.465
Exactly.

00:16:01.985 --> 00:16:04.025
That's because Physician Song
supports her.

00:16:04.625 --> 00:16:07.265
She killed Consort Li.
How many more have to die?

00:16:07.825 --> 00:16:10.185
Supervisor. Feel free
to tell me if you can prove

00:16:10.265 --> 00:16:11.945
that Pei Yu killed someone.

00:16:12.025 --> 00:16:13.625
The Palace Investigation Bureau
will look into it.

00:16:14.865 --> 00:16:16.105
Your Ladyship.

00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:18.185
- Your Ladyship.
- Spare the formality.

00:16:18.265 --> 00:16:19.945
Although the case has been closed,

00:16:20.025 --> 00:16:22.905
we welcome new evidence
of Pei Yu's murder.

00:16:22.985 --> 00:16:25.985
I will bring her to justice,
and you will be credited.

00:16:27.425 --> 00:16:29.025
I was talking nonsense.

00:16:29.105 --> 00:16:30.345
Please forgive me, Your Ladyship.

00:16:32.105 --> 00:16:32.945
Your Ladyship.

00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:40.305
It's good to be the county princess.

00:16:41.145 --> 00:16:43.465
You get to do what you like.

00:16:44.065 --> 00:16:47.385
Among all the women in the palace,
I envy you the most.

00:16:49.345 --> 00:16:50.185
Here you go.

00:16:51.985 --> 00:16:53.665
I don't know how to make sachets.

00:16:53.745 --> 00:16:56.305
I tied it up like this.
The herbs won't fall out.

00:16:56.385 --> 00:16:58.585
Carry it with you

00:16:58.665 --> 00:17:01.385
and put it by your pillow
to prevent diseases.

00:17:01.465 --> 00:17:03.105
You're worried about an epidemic?

00:17:04.385 --> 00:17:07.785
The symptoms they mentioned
did remind me of a common cold.

00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:10.464
But some symptoms are different.

00:17:10.545 --> 00:17:14.944
It's more like an epidemic
recorded in the book.

00:17:16.585 --> 00:17:19.305
I have to tell Master to take precautions.

00:17:28.305 --> 00:17:30.585
An epidemic broke out in the palace.

00:17:30.665 --> 00:17:33.465
Tell everyone to take strict precautions.

00:17:33.545 --> 00:17:34.665
Understood.

00:17:53.985 --> 00:17:56.585
Your Ladyship. The chief eunuch
of Palace Servants' Quarters is missing.

00:17:58.185 --> 00:18:00.625
Are the infected people
accommodated there?

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:01.745
That's right.

00:18:01.825 --> 00:18:03.825
Maybe there is too much work
and he's slacking off.

00:18:03.905 --> 00:18:04.745
I'll take a look.

00:18:04.825 --> 00:18:05.945
I'll go.

00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:08.225
More and more people are getting sick.

00:18:08.305 --> 00:18:09.665
What if you get sick?

00:18:10.705 --> 00:18:12.185
Of course, you'll take care of me.

00:18:20.105 --> 00:18:21.265
I'll go with you.

00:18:21.905 --> 00:18:23.505
No one will take care of you
if you get sick.

00:18:23.585 --> 00:18:24.825
I won't get sick.

00:18:25.825 --> 00:18:26.905
Read your fortune again?

00:18:28.345 --> 00:18:29.385
Your Ladyship blesses me.

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:36.785
PALACE SERVANTS' QUARTERS

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:46.025
When did you last see the chief eunuch?

00:18:46.105 --> 00:18:46.945
At the end of the Xu hour last night.

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:50.465
He lit the medicinal herbs
in the courtyard

00:18:50.545 --> 00:18:51.665
and went to rest.

00:18:51.745 --> 00:18:54.185
He was supposed
to change shift with the eunuchs

00:18:54.265 --> 00:18:56.425
at the side hall at the end
of the Yin hour this morning.

00:18:56.505 --> 00:18:58.025
But even after two ke, he hadn't come.

00:18:58.105 --> 00:19:00.665
We were worried about him
and went to his chamber,

00:19:00.745 --> 00:19:02.665
only to find that he wasn't there.

00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:13.305
No one answered.

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:15.465
So we thought he was out.

00:19:15.545 --> 00:19:17.105
But we couldn't find him anywhere.

00:19:49.425 --> 00:19:50.545
Who is it?

00:20:10.505 --> 00:20:13.185
The chief eunuch didn't even
have time to put on his shoes.

00:20:17.985 --> 00:20:20.025
We started the night watch
at the second ke of the Hai hour.

00:20:20.105 --> 00:20:22.145
Nothing happened the entire night.

00:20:22.225 --> 00:20:23.945
Nor did we see anyone coming and going.

00:20:29.185 --> 00:20:32.225
You stayed in the side hall all night
without patrolling?

00:20:32.305 --> 00:20:33.305
That's right.

00:21:35.865 --> 00:21:38.745
Based on the rigidity of the corpse
and the depth of lividity,

00:21:38.825 --> 00:21:42.145
he died between half-past the Chou hour
and the beginning of the Yin hour.

00:21:43.505 --> 00:21:45.225
There is blood around the nose and mouth.

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:47.545
The fatal wound is at the temple.

00:21:48.345 --> 00:21:49.305
The neck is uninjured.

00:21:50.145 --> 00:21:51.665
The back collar is stained with blood.

00:22:03.545 --> 00:22:05.065
The killer is quite strong.

00:22:05.145 --> 00:22:06.265
It looks like someone

00:22:06.345 --> 00:22:09.225
broke in last night
and startled the chief eunuch.

00:22:09.305 --> 00:22:10.545
He got out of bed in a panic

00:22:11.145 --> 00:22:13.625
but was struck on the temple
with his teapot and killed.

00:22:14.505 --> 00:22:16.505
Concealed by the bed curtain,

00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:19.345
the gap between the wall and the cabinet
was difficult to notice.

00:22:19.425 --> 00:22:21.465
How did you find the body?

00:22:22.745 --> 00:22:27.865
Part of the cabinet was hit by sunlight.
The color was lighter there.

00:22:27.945 --> 00:22:29.505
The cabinet was against the wall.

00:22:29.585 --> 00:22:32.385
Otherwise, there wouldn't be
the sun-bleached pattern.

00:22:33.905 --> 00:22:36.785
The murderer hid the body in the corner

00:22:36.865 --> 00:22:39.825
and staged the scene to pretend
that the chief eunuch had gone out.

00:22:40.665 --> 00:22:42.385
How did he forget about the shoes?

00:22:43.105 --> 00:22:45.505
It was cloudy last night.
The room was not lit.

00:22:45.585 --> 00:22:46.585
Nor was there moonlight.

00:22:46.665 --> 00:22:48.025
In panic, the killer

00:22:48.105 --> 00:22:50.185
probably didn't notice
that the chief eunuch was barefoot.

00:23:00.905 --> 00:23:01.985
Your Ladyship…

00:23:02.065 --> 00:23:04.225
There was such a commotion last night.

00:23:04.305 --> 00:23:06.505
You two were here on duty
but heard nothing.

00:23:06.585 --> 00:23:08.425
You must have worked too hard.

00:23:08.505 --> 00:23:10.105
Why don't you come to rest with me?

00:23:10.185 --> 00:23:11.705
- Please spare us.
- Please spare us.

00:23:11.785 --> 00:23:13.065
- Spare us.
- Spare us.

00:23:13.145 --> 00:23:15.145
We didn't kill the chief eunuch.

00:23:15.225 --> 00:23:17.385
It was cold at night, and we were bored.

00:23:17.465 --> 00:23:19.545
So we slacked off and went to sleep.

00:23:21.025 --> 00:23:21.985
- Spare us.
- Spare us.

00:23:22.065 --> 00:23:24.625
- Please spare us.
- Tie yourselves up.

00:23:24.705 --> 00:23:25.545
Spare us.

00:23:28.785 --> 00:23:29.665
Your Ladyship.

00:23:31.825 --> 00:23:33.185
What will you do to them?

00:23:33.265 --> 00:23:35.905
They shall kneel until further orders.

00:23:37.145 --> 00:23:38.305
They didn't kill him?

00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:43.625
The epidemic makes people cough.

00:23:43.705 --> 00:23:45.865
In the worst cases,
they may even cough up blood.

00:23:45.945 --> 00:23:47.225
- Is that right?
- Yes.

00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:51.225
That's why there is blood
on the back of the chief eunuch's neck.

00:23:51.305 --> 00:23:53.385
So the murderer was seriously ill.

00:23:53.465 --> 00:23:55.665
But he was strong enough
to take down the victim.

00:23:56.985 --> 00:23:58.945
Bring me the list of patients.

00:24:02.825 --> 00:24:04.865
{\an8}PATIENT REGISTRY

00:24:04.945 --> 00:24:07.585
{\an8}About a dozen people. Too many suspects.

00:24:08.385 --> 00:24:09.825
- Let's take a look.
- No.

00:24:11.305 --> 00:24:13.345
Why don't we question them
one by one at the entrance?

00:24:14.745 --> 00:24:16.225
They are all seriously ill.

00:24:16.305 --> 00:24:18.145
Perhaps, only the killer
can get out of bed.

00:24:18.225 --> 00:24:19.825
So you know they're seriously ill.

00:24:21.025 --> 00:24:23.105
It's not worth it if you get sick.

00:24:23.785 --> 00:24:25.825
You keep saying no. What do you suggest?

00:24:27.665 --> 00:24:29.265
- I'll go.
- Nonsense.

00:24:29.825 --> 00:24:30.865
I'm an Inner Guard.

00:24:31.385 --> 00:24:32.465
Mr. Xiao, don't try to be a hero.

00:24:41.225 --> 00:24:42.425
Have some medicine. Here.

00:24:43.625 --> 00:24:44.665
Take it.

00:24:47.625 --> 00:24:48.465
Inner Guards on duty.

00:24:49.145 --> 00:24:50.825
Answer to your name.

00:24:52.385 --> 00:24:53.385
Peng Jiatan.

00:24:57.145 --> 00:24:58.385
Who is Peng Jiatan?

00:25:05.745 --> 00:25:06.825
Chang Leping.

00:25:17.425 --> 00:25:19.265
- Who did it?
- Be quiet.

00:25:19.345 --> 00:25:20.865
What's the fuss?

00:25:20.945 --> 00:25:22.785
A chief eunuch died, so what?

00:25:22.865 --> 00:25:23.865
He deserved it.

00:25:24.465 --> 00:25:25.305
Get out.

00:25:25.905 --> 00:25:26.825
I…

00:25:27.825 --> 00:25:28.865
killed him.

00:25:33.745 --> 00:25:35.385
I killed him.

00:25:35.465 --> 00:25:36.985
- I killed him.
- I killed him.

00:25:37.065 --> 00:25:38.705
- I killed him.
- I killed him.

00:25:41.385 --> 00:25:42.505
I killed him.

00:25:43.545 --> 00:25:44.785
I killed him.

00:25:44.865 --> 00:25:46.745
- I killed him.
- I killed him.

00:25:49.465 --> 00:25:51.105
- Kill him!
- Calm down.

00:25:51.185 --> 00:25:52.425
Don't hurt anyone.

00:25:53.025 --> 00:25:53.905
Back off.

00:25:56.225 --> 00:25:58.465
He fell and got hurt. Get a physician.

00:25:58.545 --> 00:25:59.945
Alright. Let me pass.

00:26:05.785 --> 00:26:07.665
Your Ladyship. Take everyone outside.

00:26:07.745 --> 00:26:09.985
Clean your hands and burn herbs.

00:26:10.065 --> 00:26:11.145
Let's go.

00:26:20.305 --> 00:26:21.665
How are the injured?

00:26:22.265 --> 00:26:23.345
They're alright.

00:26:23.425 --> 00:26:25.225
But their symptoms got worse.

00:26:25.825 --> 00:26:29.105
The medication
should have made them better.

00:26:36.105 --> 00:26:36.945
I…

00:26:37.705 --> 00:26:39.265
killed him.

00:26:39.945 --> 00:26:41.665
Your Ladyship.

00:26:42.185 --> 00:26:44.065
I only ask for a quick death.

00:26:44.145 --> 00:26:47.425
I don't think I'm getting better.

00:26:47.505 --> 00:26:51.905
I'd rather be executed
than die from illness.

00:26:52.585 --> 00:26:53.625
Nonsense.

00:26:53.705 --> 00:26:55.105
My master wrote the prescription.

00:26:55.185 --> 00:26:56.465
You will be cured.

00:26:56.545 --> 00:26:58.785
You weren't so sick when you came.

00:26:58.865 --> 00:27:00.105
I bet you didn't take
your medicine properly.

00:27:00.865 --> 00:27:02.185
Are you saying

00:27:02.265 --> 00:27:05.945
that none of us
has been taking medicine properly?

00:27:07.985 --> 00:27:09.185
Stop kneeling.

00:27:09.745 --> 00:27:10.745
Get him a chair.

00:27:10.825 --> 00:27:11.865
Understood.

00:27:15.945 --> 00:27:17.145
PALACE SERVANTS' QUARTERS

00:27:17.225 --> 00:27:20.425
The chief eunuch didn't distribute
food and medicine to you?

00:27:20.505 --> 00:27:23.865
In the beginning, there weren't
many people in the side hall.

00:27:23.945 --> 00:27:27.985
Food and medicine were distributed
on time and in the correct quantities.

00:27:28.585 --> 00:27:31.505
But as the epidemic kept developing,

00:27:32.385 --> 00:27:35.785
the side hall became
more and more crowded.

00:27:36.425 --> 00:27:41.265
Only the chief eunuch
and his six subordinates

00:27:41.345 --> 00:27:43.345
were distributing food and medicine.

00:27:43.425 --> 00:27:46.985
It was too much work
for the seven of them.

00:27:48.545 --> 00:27:49.625
And they were afraid

00:27:50.985 --> 00:27:52.545
of being infected.

00:27:53.305 --> 00:27:55.145
So we ended up with one meal

00:27:55.865 --> 00:27:59.545
and one dose of medicine every day.

00:28:01.625 --> 00:28:06.065
We kept prescribing and making medicine
every day for distribution.

00:28:06.145 --> 00:28:07.985
They didn't bring the medicine to you?

00:28:11.425 --> 00:28:13.705
The medicine all went to waste?

00:28:13.785 --> 00:28:17.745
We stayed in the side hall all day
and couldn't go out.

00:28:18.345 --> 00:28:21.545
We could only give all the food
and medicine

00:28:21.625 --> 00:28:24.425
to the sickest of us.

00:28:24.505 --> 00:28:25.785
However,

00:28:27.305 --> 00:28:29.745
people kept dying one by one.

00:28:30.985 --> 00:28:34.585
Death might be a relief.

00:28:37.985 --> 00:28:40.385
They can't find a cure for the disease.

00:28:42.585 --> 00:28:46.025
But they can get rid of the sick ones.

00:28:48.225 --> 00:28:49.785
Says who?

00:28:49.865 --> 00:28:52.545
Brilliant Lady Dou took the medicine
and it worked in three days.

00:28:55.385 --> 00:28:58.465
The weather is getting colder.

00:28:59.145 --> 00:29:02.305
The entire side hall
has only two charcoal heaters

00:29:03.225 --> 00:29:04.625
without enough charcoal.

00:29:04.705 --> 00:29:06.945
And the side hall is damp.

00:29:07.465 --> 00:29:08.705
Because of that,

00:29:09.225 --> 00:29:12.505
everyone kept getting worse.

00:29:12.585 --> 00:29:14.145
On normal days,

00:29:16.825 --> 00:29:19.585
they have to bow to the eunuchs

00:29:21.185 --> 00:29:23.105
serving Consort Shu.

00:29:23.185 --> 00:29:25.225
But in the side hall,

00:29:26.425 --> 00:29:28.745
everyone is on his own.

00:29:29.465 --> 00:29:31.025
So you decided to kill him.

00:29:33.265 --> 00:29:35.825
I never wanted to kill him.

00:29:36.505 --> 00:29:37.585
Last night,

00:29:38.225 --> 00:29:40.105
I noticed that the night guards

00:29:40.185 --> 00:29:45.585
went to sleep
under the porch after the Hai hour.

00:29:46.185 --> 00:29:48.825
I took the opportunity to sneak out

00:29:50.025 --> 00:29:54.785
to gather food
for those who were seriously ill.

00:30:19.225 --> 00:30:20.225
Who is there?

00:30:21.385 --> 00:30:22.625
Who is there?

00:30:28.025 --> 00:30:28.905
Chai?

00:30:28.985 --> 00:30:30.065
How…

00:30:30.145 --> 00:30:31.585
How did you get in here?

00:30:31.665 --> 00:30:33.625
Don't shout.

00:30:33.705 --> 00:30:35.065
You sickly wretch!

00:30:35.585 --> 00:30:38.705
Guards! Guards! Guards!

00:30:44.305 --> 00:30:46.625
I didn't want him to bring the guards

00:30:46.705 --> 00:30:48.905
and get me into trouble.

00:30:49.545 --> 00:30:52.265
I was just trying to shut him up.

00:30:53.825 --> 00:30:55.265
But I ended up

00:30:55.985 --> 00:30:58.385
killing him with one strike.

00:31:43.385 --> 00:31:45.225
I was lost for a while

00:31:45.865 --> 00:31:47.585
after I hid the body.

00:31:50.225 --> 00:31:51.625
Then I came to my senses

00:31:52.225 --> 00:31:54.745
and went back with the food in my arms.

00:31:55.665 --> 00:31:57.025
I didn't expect…

00:31:57.105 --> 00:31:58.305
You didn't expect

00:31:59.745 --> 00:32:01.825
that his shoes left in the room

00:32:01.905 --> 00:32:04.745
and the blood on his back collar
would sell you out.

00:32:10.425 --> 00:32:14.345
I am going to die, anyway.

00:32:16.825 --> 00:32:18.865
Let's see if I get executed

00:32:19.665 --> 00:32:21.865
or die from the illness.

00:32:28.985 --> 00:32:30.825
The illness is not receding but advancing.

00:32:30.905 --> 00:32:32.985
Many physicians got sick, as well.

00:32:33.065 --> 00:32:35.625
The previous prescriptions
had little effect.

00:32:35.705 --> 00:32:38.305
It's pointless to keep prescribing them.

00:32:42.225 --> 00:32:43.585
The patients are mainly coughing,

00:32:44.305 --> 00:32:46.345
having a fever,
and are scared of the cold.

00:32:47.585 --> 00:32:48.905
Add Lung-Diffusing

00:32:48.985 --> 00:32:52.385
and Toxin-Resolving Formula
to the prescription.

00:32:58.665 --> 00:32:59.505
Master.

00:33:05.745 --> 00:33:06.585
Master.

00:33:27.585 --> 00:33:30.905
PALACE SERVANTS' QUARTERS

00:33:40.745 --> 00:33:42.105
Buddy.

00:33:42.185 --> 00:33:43.265
Buddy.

00:33:52.225 --> 00:33:56.465
Take this heater to the side hall.

00:33:57.065 --> 00:33:59.105
Her Ladyship prepared this for you.

00:33:59.705 --> 00:34:01.985
We'll be punished if we take it away.

00:34:02.065 --> 00:34:04.905
Her Ladyship has put extra heaters
in the side hall.

00:34:04.985 --> 00:34:07.025
I am grateful.

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:08.945
But I don't need it.

00:34:09.465 --> 00:34:10.705
I'm not cold.

00:34:11.304 --> 00:34:13.585
If she blames you,

00:34:14.105 --> 00:34:16.025
I'll take sole responsibility.

00:34:18.784 --> 00:34:19.625
Go.

00:34:19.705 --> 00:34:20.744
Go ahead.

00:34:47.824 --> 00:34:48.665
Technician Pei.

00:34:49.585 --> 00:34:51.025
Wake up. Boil the medicine.

00:34:51.705 --> 00:34:53.784
The young prince got sick, too.

00:35:05.305 --> 00:35:06.225
I am incompetent.

00:35:06.305 --> 00:35:08.145
I deserve punishment.

00:35:12.785 --> 00:35:15.345
What's the point even if I kill you?

00:35:15.865 --> 00:35:16.705
Rise.

00:35:18.665 --> 00:35:20.385
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:35:23.625 --> 00:35:26.185
Your Majesty. Forgive my boldness.
I have an idea.

00:35:26.945 --> 00:35:27.785
What is it?

00:35:29.105 --> 00:35:31.905
The Imperial Medical Office
is full of talented people.

00:35:31.985 --> 00:35:34.345
Why don't we collect prescriptions
at this critical moment?

00:35:35.945 --> 00:35:36.785
Your Ladyship.

00:35:36.865 --> 00:35:38.625
We have many talents,

00:35:38.705 --> 00:35:41.065
but not everyone is eligible
to prescribe medicine.

00:35:41.145 --> 00:35:42.585
Wouldn't it be dangerous

00:35:42.665 --> 00:35:46.105
if an ill-informed person
rashly formulated a prescription?

00:35:46.705 --> 00:35:48.545
I'm sure you supervisors and physicians

00:35:48.625 --> 00:35:50.785
won't accept the wrong prescriptions.

00:35:55.145 --> 00:35:56.305
Your Majesty, bad news.

00:35:56.385 --> 00:35:58.305
The young prince is running a fever again.

00:36:00.465 --> 00:36:03.025
You have been trying so hard to no avail.

00:36:03.105 --> 00:36:05.265
Why don't you leave it
to someone competent?

00:36:05.345 --> 00:36:06.825
Pass on my order.

00:36:06.905 --> 00:36:08.745
The Imperial Medical Office
shall collect prescriptions.

00:36:09.545 --> 00:36:13.625
But we don't know how effective
the new medicines are without testing.

00:36:13.705 --> 00:36:14.825
We dare not

00:36:14.905 --> 00:36:17.025
- put His Highness at risk.
- Then start collecting prescriptions

00:36:17.105 --> 00:36:18.025
and testing them.

00:36:18.105 --> 00:36:19.545
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:36:23.185 --> 00:36:25.385
CULTIVATION OF MERIT AND WISDOM

00:36:25.465 --> 00:36:26.465
Your Majesty, wait.

00:36:29.225 --> 00:36:30.625
I must confess to you.

00:36:30.705 --> 00:36:32.145
What did you do?

00:36:33.145 --> 00:36:34.665
I should have shared Lady Su's burden.

00:36:35.865 --> 00:36:37.305
How are you going to do that?

00:36:37.385 --> 00:36:41.025
Lady Su only wants
an exorcism to steady her mind.

00:36:41.105 --> 00:36:43.345
Mr. Xiao pretended
to be a feng shui master

00:36:43.425 --> 00:36:44.945
to help with the investigation.

00:36:45.025 --> 00:36:47.745
But he studied astronomy
in the Astronomical Bureau for ten years.

00:36:47.825 --> 00:36:50.985
Putting on an act
was not where his talents lay.

00:36:51.065 --> 00:36:52.585
But I am the expert.

00:36:55.265 --> 00:36:56.265
Alright.

00:36:56.345 --> 00:36:59.145
Let's say I made a mistake
out of desperation.

00:36:59.225 --> 00:37:02.185
I won't ask Huaijin
to do such things again.

00:37:07.185 --> 00:37:10.505
PALACE SERVANTS' QUARTERS

00:37:12.185 --> 00:37:16.385
After all the trouble,
you only found one prescription?

00:37:17.665 --> 00:37:19.225
Do you still feel cold?

00:37:24.585 --> 00:37:25.985
It's alright if nothing happens.

00:37:26.065 --> 00:37:29.025
Otherwise,
you can't bear the consequences.

00:37:29.105 --> 00:37:30.465
It's okay.

00:37:30.545 --> 00:37:31.625
You'll be fine.

00:37:52.625 --> 00:37:53.825
No way.

00:37:53.905 --> 00:37:56.585
I checked his pulse earlier
and adjusted the prescription.

00:37:56.665 --> 00:37:58.025
It shouldn't be like this.

00:38:00.345 --> 00:38:01.985
Your prescription kills people.

00:38:02.065 --> 00:38:04.945
How dare you!
Killing Consort Li wasn't enough.

00:38:05.025 --> 00:38:06.585
Now you want to kill the young prince?

00:38:07.225 --> 00:38:10.385
Did Liu Jia suffer from any other diseases
that he didn't tell us about?

00:38:10.465 --> 00:38:12.345
We checked his pulse together.

00:38:12.425 --> 00:38:13.265
What is the problem?

00:38:13.345 --> 00:38:15.785
You lack medical skills,
and you blame the patients.

00:38:15.865 --> 00:38:16.945
Where are your ethics?

00:38:17.025 --> 00:38:19.665
No. A woman wants to become a physician?

00:38:19.745 --> 00:38:20.825
Enough.

00:38:20.905 --> 00:38:22.425
Enough.

00:38:25.385 --> 00:38:27.865
You guys. Stop nagging.

00:38:27.945 --> 00:38:29.065
So annoying.

00:38:29.145 --> 00:38:33.265
His Majesty is waiting for a prescription
to cure the disease and save lives.

00:38:33.785 --> 00:38:35.025
I don't care if what happened

00:38:35.105 --> 00:38:38.065
was due to the incompetence
of the Imperial Medical Office

00:38:38.145 --> 00:38:40.825
or someone was taking
the opportunity to gain fame

00:38:41.705 --> 00:38:43.625
or someone

00:38:43.705 --> 00:38:46.985
was taking the opportunity
to murder the young prince.

00:38:47.505 --> 00:38:49.745
The Palace Investigation Bureau

00:38:49.825 --> 00:38:52.505
will get to the bottom of it.
