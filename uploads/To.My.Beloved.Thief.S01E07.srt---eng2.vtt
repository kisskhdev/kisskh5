WEBVTT

00:00:57.704 --> 00:00:58.580
{\an8}I'm back.

00:00:59.998 --> 00:01:01.541
{\an8}I'm finally back…

00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:11.342
{\an8}Who are you…

00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:15.638
{\an8}Are you Gil-dong?

00:01:16.598 --> 00:01:18.516
{\an8}Someone held a blade to my throat.

00:01:19.517 --> 00:01:20.685
{\an8}Does that mean…

00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:22.645
{\an8}Dae-chu, the sword.

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:38.369
Holding a blade to my throat

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.539
won't get you the answer you want.

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:43.666
I don't think so.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.462
A blade is the quickest way
to carve out what lies in a human heart.

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:52.175
If you think I'm Gil-dong,

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:53.676
report me to the constabulary.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.512
That is all I can say.

00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:08.066
If this single blade

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.694
were enough to make you confess
who you are,

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:13.488
I might truly have taken your head.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.576
Why did you put me to the test?

00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:21.412
I'm not taking anything
to the constabulary.

00:02:22.163 --> 00:02:23.498
Come with me.

00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.500
We need Gil-dong's name.

00:02:26.876 --> 00:02:28.962
Gil-dong's name?

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:38.638
Hong Eun-jo!

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.015
Where is she?

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.975
Hong Eun-jo!

00:02:44.352 --> 00:02:46.521
Is that you?

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.089
All the way here,

00:03:13.172 --> 00:03:15.883
I prayed that
I might never return to my own body,

00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:18.803
if only I could let you return to yours.

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:28.563
I was waiting for you.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.898
I thought that if I moved,

00:03:30.982 --> 00:03:35.153
we would miss each other like last time.

00:03:38.406 --> 00:03:39.699
Did you get hurt anywhere?

00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:43.077
No, I'm fine.

00:03:47.957 --> 00:03:49.250
Just for a moment.

00:03:50.335 --> 00:03:52.003
I have no hidden intentions.

00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:54.630
I just want to see
if this is a dream or not.

00:04:06.184 --> 00:04:07.852
You can wake up from the nightmare now.

00:04:09.187 --> 00:04:11.064
I didn't say this before,

00:04:11.564 --> 00:04:13.900
but I was afraid I might never come back.

00:04:14.776 --> 00:04:16.235
I was scared

00:04:16.986 --> 00:04:18.321
every night.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.332
Though it must have been worse for you,

00:04:29.415 --> 00:04:30.750
becoming a widow all of a sudden.

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.130
It's good to see you again, Hong Eun-jo.

00:04:36.631 --> 00:04:38.883
Every second, I was afraid

00:04:38.966 --> 00:04:40.968
I might never be able to say this.

00:04:47.475 --> 00:04:48.726
So

00:04:49.227 --> 00:04:51.312
who held the sword to your throat?

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.024
Gil-dong turned me down on the spot.

00:04:55.108 --> 00:04:57.276
He said that he was different
from what the rumors say,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.946
and that he didn't kill the Chief Censor.

00:05:06.244 --> 00:05:07.286
I SHALL MEET HER MYSELF

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.791
Yourself?

00:05:14.752 --> 00:05:17.588
If I tell him the truth, he'll be worried.

00:05:18.214 --> 00:05:19.257
A bandit.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.425
A bandit?

00:05:20.508 --> 00:05:24.178
You always travel with guards,
so you probably never run into them.

00:05:24.262 --> 00:05:26.556
But someone like me,
who goes around alone,

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.059
runs into them as often
as you run into wild animals at night.

00:05:30.143 --> 00:05:32.061
Did the shock mess with your head?

00:05:32.145 --> 00:05:35.231
How could you be so calm
about running into a bandit?

00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:40.027
The first couple of times
surprised me too.

00:05:40.862 --> 00:05:42.029
Also…

00:05:44.323 --> 00:05:48.119
Wouldn't it be strange for a thief
to be scared of a bandit?

00:05:49.162 --> 00:05:52.373
If you think about it,
we're in the same line of work.

00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:54.750
This is no time for jokes.

00:05:56.377 --> 00:05:58.212
I'm just trying to reassure you.

00:06:01.132 --> 00:06:02.592
Are you really all right?

00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:04.385
Look.

00:06:04.468 --> 00:06:06.512
My neck's still attached here. See?

00:06:06.596 --> 00:06:09.015
No, you can't see it.

00:06:09.098 --> 00:06:11.726
You can't see
how shattered my heart is from the shock.

00:06:12.602 --> 00:06:14.395
How great is that?

00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:17.523
If I could feel it,
it'd mean I'm not in my body.

00:06:22.445 --> 00:06:24.614
I'm standing on my own feet,

00:06:24.697 --> 00:06:26.365
speaking with my own mouth

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:30.286
and seeing with my eyes.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.997
I can't believe how happy this makes me.

00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:47.220
The hoofprints lead into that alley.

00:06:47.887 --> 00:06:48.888
Follow them.

00:06:49.388 --> 00:06:50.473
Yes, sir.

00:06:50.556 --> 00:06:52.350
- Follow them.
- Yes, sir.

00:06:56.687 --> 00:06:57.688
Your Highness!

00:07:01.234 --> 00:07:03.778
How did you two already…

00:07:04.528 --> 00:07:05.404
Well…

00:07:05.488 --> 00:07:08.699
We happened to run into each other.

00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:10.243
I sent out a carrier pigeon.

00:07:10.326 --> 00:07:11.160
What?

00:07:11.244 --> 00:07:12.954
It's this way, sir!

00:07:13.538 --> 00:07:15.331
The soldiers are chasing Your Highness.

00:07:15.414 --> 00:07:16.457
Already?

00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:20.294
Right. The State Tribunal's soldiers
were blocking the way.

00:07:20.378 --> 00:07:21.671
What's going on?

00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:23.756
You're talking as if you saw it yourself.

00:07:26.384 --> 00:07:27.843
Someone described it so vividly

00:07:27.927 --> 00:07:30.221
that it feels like I saw it myself.

00:07:30.805 --> 00:07:31.931
Right?

00:07:32.348 --> 00:07:36.394
Only His Majesty and the Chief Secretary
can order the State Tribunal to act.

00:07:36.477 --> 00:07:37.645
And His Majesty

00:07:37.728 --> 00:07:40.481
has no reason to break his promise
from the Gyeongo Year.

00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:43.234
So it must be the Chief Secretary.

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:46.529
But why?

00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:48.239
Dae-chu,

00:07:48.322 --> 00:07:51.075
when have I been acting
out of character recently?

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.454
When you punished the Chief Censor
and saved the people?

00:07:56.956 --> 00:07:59.917
Don't you think it was kind of random
how I carried out justice?

00:08:01.711 --> 00:08:02.795
Wait here.

00:08:03.796 --> 00:08:04.755
Can we have a word?

00:08:07.216 --> 00:08:09.385
Do you remember the ledger
you gave me as Gil-dong?

00:08:09.468 --> 00:08:11.262
Is it from the Chief Secretary's place?

00:08:11.804 --> 00:08:12.638
No.

00:08:12.722 --> 00:08:15.850
The Chief Censor meant to have it burned,
and I happened to find it.

00:08:16.684 --> 00:08:18.853
The Chief Censor tried to burn it?

00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:22.690
Now I'm seeing the big picture.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.317
What picture?

00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:27.069
The portrait.

00:08:27.987 --> 00:08:29.989
Why are you asking me this now?

00:08:33.326 --> 00:08:34.410
I'll explain later.

00:08:34.493 --> 00:08:35.870
You just keep your promise

00:08:35.953 --> 00:08:38.914
that you wouldn't be caught
by anyone but me.

00:08:40.082 --> 00:08:41.250
Something happened, right?

00:08:41.334 --> 00:08:42.335
Answer me first.

00:08:44.587 --> 00:08:45.504
Fine.

00:08:46.589 --> 00:08:49.383
In any case, don't worry about me.

00:08:49.925 --> 00:08:51.552
What's all this about?

00:08:51.636 --> 00:08:52.637
Dae-chu.

00:08:56.307 --> 00:08:57.183
Yes, Your Highness.

00:08:57.266 --> 00:08:58.225
Escort her home.

00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:00.394
And if you run into any bandits,

00:09:00.478 --> 00:09:01.979
crush them on my behalf.

00:09:09.195 --> 00:09:11.322
Hey, over here.

00:09:18.162 --> 00:09:20.414
It seemed like
you were hurrying somewhere.

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:25.127
Only I, the Grand Prince,
can ask questions.

00:09:25.211 --> 00:09:26.671
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

00:09:27.088 --> 00:09:29.715
I'm questioning a suspect now.

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:32.843
Your Highness is suspected
of freeing Gil-dong, the thief.

00:09:32.927 --> 00:09:33.844
Gil-dong?

00:09:33.928 --> 00:09:36.055
You're pretty good.

00:09:36.806 --> 00:09:38.057
You found out.

00:09:39.475 --> 00:09:41.394
Are you admitting to doing it?

00:09:41.727 --> 00:09:43.145
I have no reason to hide it.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.153
Take me to the State Tribunal.

00:09:51.487 --> 00:09:52.863
Yes, Your Highness!

00:09:57.785 --> 00:09:58.911
Stay out of it for now.

00:09:58.994 --> 00:10:00.496
I understand you're concerned,

00:10:00.579 --> 00:10:02.456
but there is nothing you can do.

00:10:03.624 --> 00:10:06.127
He said he had no reason to hide it.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.838
He can't afford to lose face
as a member of the royal family.

00:10:11.549 --> 00:10:13.759
It's almost embarrassing that

00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:17.722
the dirt you dug up on the royal family,
as a so-called virtuous scholar,

00:10:17.805 --> 00:10:21.100
was merely the freeing
of a righteous thief helping the people.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.066
It seems I have served my purpose.
I shall take my leave.

00:10:29.692 --> 00:10:31.318
I just can't bring myself

00:10:31.402 --> 00:10:34.321
to side with any of you in this fight.

00:10:41.704 --> 00:10:43.622
The soldiers are chasing Your Highness.

00:10:43.706 --> 00:10:46.542
Your Highness is suspected
of freeing Gil-dong, the thief.

00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:47.835
Take me to the State Tribunal.

00:10:59.847 --> 00:11:02.183
Did you hear some sad news or something?

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.810
Something like

00:11:05.603 --> 00:11:07.730
the Grand Prince
being detained by the State Tribunal?

00:11:08.856 --> 00:11:10.816
I have nothing more to add, Young Master.

00:11:12.776 --> 00:11:15.070
Why are you using honorifics
all of a sudden?

00:11:15.654 --> 00:11:16.739
I see.

00:11:17.448 --> 00:11:18.949
You're scared now.

00:11:19.617 --> 00:11:21.368
You're scared I might disclose everything.

00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:23.871
I have no reason to be scared,

00:11:23.954 --> 00:11:26.790
even if you disclose it.

00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:29.752
I'm thinking about when to disclose it

00:11:29.835 --> 00:11:31.378
for the greatest impact.

00:11:34.173 --> 00:11:37.760
You could've at least told me
that he was the Grand Prince.

00:11:38.052 --> 00:11:40.888
Then I wouldn't have given you
that stupid advice

00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:43.224
that no one was coming to your rescue.

00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:47.102
You can mock me all you want.

00:11:47.186 --> 00:11:49.104
I can endure your mockery
a thousand times over.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.440
But please don't speak of him

00:11:51.524 --> 00:11:52.983
so lightly.

00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:58.113
Not once has he done anything
deserving mockery.

00:12:07.164 --> 00:12:08.165
Do you really think so?

00:12:10.709 --> 00:12:13.546
Why don't you worry
about the cloud over yourself first?

00:12:16.549 --> 00:12:19.134
No one is coming
to rescue the lady of the annex.

00:12:19.635 --> 00:12:21.929
The Grand Prince
will soon meet his downfall.

00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:42.616
I escorted her to the front gate.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.534
How did she look?

00:12:43.617 --> 00:12:45.411
She seemed quite baffled.

00:12:50.249 --> 00:12:51.333
By the way,

00:12:51.417 --> 00:12:54.420
where was I going on horseback
at this late hour?

00:12:55.045 --> 00:12:56.964
Did you forget already?

00:12:57.047 --> 00:12:59.925
You said you were going to save Hong-si
from Lim Jae-i.

00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:01.176
I did?

00:13:01.552 --> 00:13:03.429
Your Highness, you're scaring me.

00:13:03.512 --> 00:13:04.555
All you say lately is,

00:13:04.638 --> 00:13:05.848
"I did that?"

00:13:05.931 --> 00:13:07.349
And, "Oh, I did that!"

00:13:07.433 --> 00:13:08.851
Do you realize that?

00:13:11.854 --> 00:13:15.524
She was almost saved
by her Prince Charming.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.318
Too bad.

00:13:17.401 --> 00:13:18.527
What are you…

00:13:20.487 --> 00:13:21.947
Your Highness, at this point,

00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:24.658
it's safe to say your memory is gone,
not just deteriorating.

00:13:26.994 --> 00:13:27.870
Dae-chu,

00:13:27.953 --> 00:13:30.289
I've been pretty nice
to you lately, right?

00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:35.377
Do you have a way
to escape this situation?

00:13:35.794 --> 00:13:37.212
One way I know for sure is

00:13:37.296 --> 00:13:38.297
a honey trap.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.965
No chance.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.509
Pardon my interruption.

00:13:42.593 --> 00:13:44.678
By order, I can't give you much time.

00:13:46.305 --> 00:13:49.016
Just insist that it was a mistake.
There's no other way.

00:13:50.726 --> 00:13:52.853
They made their move,

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.898
so I might as well respond accordingly.

00:14:00.736 --> 00:14:01.570
What?

00:14:01.654 --> 00:14:05.658
The Grand Prince was detained
by the State Tribunal?

00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:08.077
And the person
who arrested the Grand Prince

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.536
happens to be…

00:14:11.914 --> 00:14:12.915
Hae-rim.

00:14:12.998 --> 00:14:14.750
My lady, you're here…

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:17.086
Go and tell them.

00:14:22.633 --> 00:14:25.803
My lady wishes to see Grand Prince Dowol.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.638
His Highness is detained now.

00:14:27.721 --> 00:14:29.848
Tell your lady that she cannot.

00:14:30.891 --> 00:14:32.309
It will only take a moment.

00:14:32.393 --> 00:14:33.435
What?

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:35.729
It will feel much longer for me.

00:14:36.355 --> 00:14:37.564
Why don't you count it?

00:14:38.983 --> 00:14:40.150
Sir.

00:14:41.986 --> 00:14:44.238
You'll need to leave soon,
so make sure it's enough.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.948
Right.

00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:47.408
You're only taking half of it

00:14:47.866 --> 00:14:49.660
because it's the cost of two heads.

00:14:51.161 --> 00:14:52.413
My lady.

00:15:03.882 --> 00:15:05.467
You are the State Tribunal's secretary,

00:15:05.551 --> 00:15:08.137
so you must know
what happened to the Grand Prince.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.973
Who on earth arrested His Highness
and caused all this trouble?

00:15:11.598 --> 00:15:13.183
Actually, it's obvious.

00:15:13.267 --> 00:15:15.686
Must be some ignorant, thoughtless man.

00:15:16.645 --> 00:15:18.689
You have seen him many times already,

00:15:18.772 --> 00:15:20.232
and you're seeing him right now.

00:15:22.484 --> 00:15:24.028
And you're right about the man.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.323
I'm playing the villain here.

00:15:30.868 --> 00:15:33.328
I saw you with the Grand Prince
in the palace before.

00:15:33.412 --> 00:15:35.289
How close are you?

00:15:37.249 --> 00:15:38.959
By family order,

00:15:39.043 --> 00:15:41.253
His Majesty is my great uncle,

00:15:42.254 --> 00:15:45.174
so His Highness and I are in-laws.

00:15:46.133 --> 00:15:48.177
Not by family ties, but emotionally.

00:15:49.762 --> 00:15:52.681
A young lady from a noble family,
who has never done anything unlawful,

00:15:53.307 --> 00:15:55.559
tried to bribe a soldier

00:15:55.642 --> 00:15:57.603
to meet her so-called in-law?

00:16:00.105 --> 00:16:01.815
Is it an uncharacteristic lapse?

00:16:02.649 --> 00:16:04.026
Or unspoken feelings?

00:16:05.027 --> 00:16:06.278
That's not…

00:16:11.533 --> 00:16:12.367
Go to the palace.

00:16:12.951 --> 00:16:15.162
His Highness
must have headed to the Main Hall.

00:16:18.165 --> 00:16:20.084
Though our engagement is to be broken off,

00:16:20.167 --> 00:16:22.628
let me say one thing as your fiancé.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.298
Those feelings of yours…

00:16:26.799 --> 00:16:27.966
I support them

00:16:29.426 --> 00:16:30.719
with all my heart.

00:16:41.563 --> 00:16:43.982
The Grand Prince
will soon meet his downfall.

00:16:58.163 --> 00:16:59.331
Boo!

00:16:59.832 --> 00:17:01.125
Hey, Eun-jo.

00:17:01.208 --> 00:17:04.169
You haven't eaten anything.

00:17:06.505 --> 00:17:08.799
Are the men's quarters empty now?

00:17:08.882 --> 00:17:11.635
Yes, nobody is there.
Everyone left this morning.

00:17:12.386 --> 00:17:14.847
I must step out for a moment too.

00:17:18.058 --> 00:17:20.435
His Highness sends word

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:22.396
- that you need not worry--
- Nonsense!

00:17:22.479 --> 00:17:25.524
This petty thief dishonored
a noble scholar by feigning death.

00:17:25.607 --> 00:17:28.735
The scholars and officials of this realm
will not let this pass.

00:17:28.819 --> 00:17:32.406
Please, Your Majesty!

00:17:32.489 --> 00:17:35.826
Please, Your Majesty!

00:17:37.411 --> 00:17:40.164
I ordered them to stir things
just enough to give us a pretext.

00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:43.667
There has never been such a thing

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:47.838
as a royal siding with thieves!

00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:49.590
Your Majesty!

00:17:50.048 --> 00:17:51.633
Is it not Dae-il?

00:17:52.176 --> 00:17:53.802
I ordered him to do it.

00:17:53.886 --> 00:17:57.347
He lives off our family,
so he must earn his keep at least.

00:17:57.806 --> 00:17:59.057
Let us make haste.

00:17:59.141 --> 00:18:01.268
The officials are waiting
in the Main Hall.

00:18:02.561 --> 00:18:06.481
Please, Your Majesty!

00:18:18.702 --> 00:18:20.037
Your Highness.

00:18:25.709 --> 00:18:27.169
You seem glad to see me.

00:18:28.045 --> 00:18:29.630
Are you glad to see your target?

00:18:31.298 --> 00:18:33.759
No one could have plotted
something like this against me

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.261
other than you

00:18:36.345 --> 00:18:37.221
and His Majesty.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.100
Why does he suspect me first,
not the King?

00:18:42.684 --> 00:18:43.810
Chief Secretary Im,

00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:47.981
His Majesty may keep me in check,
but he would not attack me.

00:18:49.191 --> 00:18:51.026
That bloody year of Gyeongo,

00:18:51.568 --> 00:18:53.946
we swore an oath as brothers.

00:18:54.738 --> 00:18:57.199
It's an oath bound by blood
that is thicker than water.

00:18:58.367 --> 00:18:59.493
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

00:18:59.576 --> 00:19:02.120
There is no reason
I would dare do that to Your--

00:19:02.204 --> 00:19:03.413
I think I know it.

00:19:04.665 --> 00:19:05.791
The reason.

00:19:08.794 --> 00:19:11.380
Whether to threaten him, extort him
or demand his submission,

00:19:11.463 --> 00:19:14.508
for whatever reason,
you passed the ledger to the Chief Censor.

00:19:15.592 --> 00:19:16.760
And that's the moment

00:19:18.345 --> 00:19:21.556
I happened to find that ledger
and brought it to His Majesty.

00:19:22.724 --> 00:19:24.768
It seems that's how
I ended up getting in your way.

00:19:29.189 --> 00:19:31.400
I was wondering who had kept

00:19:31.984 --> 00:19:34.027
such extensive and in-depth records.

00:19:35.237 --> 00:19:36.530
It was you.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.076
Your Highness,

00:19:41.576 --> 00:19:43.704
I'm afraid I don't quite follow.

00:19:46.164 --> 00:19:47.958
Of course, all of that is only assumption.

00:19:48.458 --> 00:19:49.835
But now, I'm giving you a command.

00:19:51.795 --> 00:19:52.838
From this moment on,

00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:55.382
keep your hands off
anything related to Gil-dong.

00:19:58.593 --> 00:20:00.470
Does that mean,

00:20:01.054 --> 00:20:02.514
from this moment on,

00:20:02.597 --> 00:20:05.934
Your Highness will refrain
from making assumptions about the ledger?

00:20:08.729 --> 00:20:09.813
The deal…

00:20:13.442 --> 00:20:14.401
is sealed.

00:20:14.484 --> 00:20:16.153
As you wish, Your Highness.

00:20:22.659 --> 00:20:23.702
Right.

00:20:24.494 --> 00:20:26.830
You should teach your two sons
some manners.

00:20:27.664 --> 00:20:28.790
Like father, like son.

00:20:40.052 --> 00:20:41.386
Chief Secretary Im arrested Yeol?

00:20:44.014 --> 00:20:46.391
Without my permission?

00:20:47.267 --> 00:20:50.145
I hear it all happened during the night.

00:20:50.562 --> 00:20:53.273
He was just being a loyal official,
trying to ease your worries

00:20:53.357 --> 00:20:54.691
as quickly as he could.

00:20:54.775 --> 00:20:57.694
This is a great chance
to remove the thorn in our side.

00:20:58.362 --> 00:21:01.239
Your Majesty,
the Chief Secretary requests an audience.

00:21:01.323 --> 00:21:03.700
It seems
he's already brought some good news.

00:21:05.577 --> 00:21:06.953
It must be bad news.

00:21:07.037 --> 00:21:09.915
It seems my brother
had quite some words with you.

00:21:13.126 --> 00:21:14.628
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

00:21:15.253 --> 00:21:16.713
Regarding the Grand Prince Dowol,

00:21:16.797 --> 00:21:19.591
it seems there was a mistake
at the State Tribunal.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:21.551
Chief Secretary Im,

00:21:21.635 --> 00:21:23.512
your loyalty went too far.

00:21:23.929 --> 00:21:26.556
Do not take unnecessary action
without my command.

00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:30.519
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:21:34.356 --> 00:21:36.775
It feels like the medicine
is working better every day.

00:21:37.234 --> 00:21:39.569
I haven't felt this light in a long time.

00:21:39.653 --> 00:21:43.031
We're going hunting at the Royal Villa.
Make the necessary preparations.

00:21:44.574 --> 00:21:45.575
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:21:57.504 --> 00:22:00.715
What I thought was a winning move
turned against me.

00:22:01.133 --> 00:22:02.968
We swore an oath as brothers.

00:22:03.051 --> 00:22:05.720
Do not take unnecessary action
without my command.

00:22:06.263 --> 00:22:09.224
They may be half-brothers,
but they still share blood.

00:22:09.766 --> 00:22:10.976
I realize that now.

00:22:11.059 --> 00:22:12.894
I'll find another pretext soon enough.

00:22:12.978 --> 00:22:15.981
And this time, Grand Prince Dowol
will be struck properly.

00:22:16.356 --> 00:22:19.818
Now is the time
to let the waters settle and clear,

00:22:22.154 --> 00:22:24.030
until His Majesty's blood

00:22:25.448 --> 00:22:28.326
fully belongs to our family.

00:22:29.202 --> 00:22:30.453
Stop the investigation?

00:22:32.956 --> 00:22:33.832
Wait.

00:22:33.915 --> 00:22:36.751
What will happen to you now?
You arrested His Highness.

00:22:36.835 --> 00:22:39.462
I will be punished
for arresting the Grand Prince in haste.

00:22:41.381 --> 00:22:42.883
If I were them, I would just kill me.

00:22:42.966 --> 00:22:44.676
And that shall be done, of course.

00:22:47.971 --> 00:22:50.223
Pay your respects to Her Majesty.

00:22:50.307 --> 00:22:52.767
Your Majesty.
I am Seung-baek of the Kim family.

00:22:53.393 --> 00:22:54.477
I'm Jae-i of the Im family.

00:22:55.353 --> 00:22:57.731
You must be
Chief Secretary Im's second son.

00:22:58.732 --> 00:23:00.483
I will remember your name
and your father's

00:23:00.567 --> 00:23:02.027
for threatening my son's life.

00:23:06.031 --> 00:23:08.783
His Highness is heading to his residence.

00:23:33.266 --> 00:23:35.727
Is there anything interesting to see
in my residence?

00:23:36.102 --> 00:23:37.229
Your Highness.

00:23:38.188 --> 00:23:39.689
- Grim Reaper?
- What?

00:23:39.773 --> 00:23:41.107
Right.

00:23:41.524 --> 00:23:43.860
Have you been released
by the State Tribunal?

00:23:43.944 --> 00:23:44.986
As you can see.

00:23:45.862 --> 00:23:47.113
That's a relief!

00:23:48.615 --> 00:23:49.866
Were you just passing by?

00:23:51.409 --> 00:23:52.327
Well…

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:54.871
I was worried,
so I came to see how things were.

00:24:00.377 --> 00:24:02.587
So we're close enough now
to worry about each other?

00:24:03.338 --> 00:24:05.090
I have overstepped.

00:24:05.173 --> 00:24:06.758
That's not what I meant.

00:24:06.841 --> 00:24:08.385
Let's say it's a formality.

00:24:10.303 --> 00:24:11.846
Are you all right?

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.056
Do I not seem all right?

00:24:13.556 --> 00:24:15.809
There's no way my handsomeness has faded.

00:24:16.977 --> 00:24:18.645
Not at all. You're overflowing with it.

00:24:18.728 --> 00:24:19.771
Anyway,

00:24:19.854 --> 00:24:21.398
I appreciate your kind heart.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.248
Court Lady Kim.

00:24:38.999 --> 00:24:41.835
Find out who that lady is, discreetly.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.461
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:24:49.467 --> 00:24:50.969
This is the only way.

00:24:51.052 --> 00:24:53.179
I'm the one at fault.

00:24:53.263 --> 00:24:55.015
You look like you're about to confess.

00:24:55.098 --> 00:24:56.349
Yes.

00:24:56.433 --> 00:24:57.892
I'm going to tell the truth and…

00:25:01.563 --> 00:25:02.897
Don't be so hasty.

00:25:04.107 --> 00:25:05.150
Don't worry.

00:25:05.233 --> 00:25:07.235
This matter will cause no further trouble.

00:25:07.736 --> 00:25:08.570
Really?

00:25:09.654 --> 00:25:10.989
All thanks to the combination

00:25:11.072 --> 00:25:13.783
of my status as Grand Prince
and my sharp mind.

00:25:15.368 --> 00:25:16.244
Of course.

00:25:17.037 --> 00:25:18.496
I was hasty indeed.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.874
I told you to keep our promise,
and you're already…

00:25:23.626 --> 00:25:26.212
Why did you come to the constabulary?
You're a thief.

00:25:28.131 --> 00:25:31.593
I tried to act like I didn't know,
but that's just not me.

00:25:31.676 --> 00:25:33.136
Or maybe you were worried about me?

00:25:34.721 --> 00:25:36.181
Absolutely not.

00:25:36.264 --> 00:25:37.515
Just think about it.

00:25:37.599 --> 00:25:38.600
A petty thief…

00:25:39.434 --> 00:25:41.728
A petty thief nearly got you punished.

00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:43.063
How could I just sit and watch?

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.066
You clearly look like
you can't take a beating.

00:25:46.816 --> 00:25:47.734
Me?

00:25:47.817 --> 00:25:50.945
I doubt a Grand Prince
has ever taken a single lash.

00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:53.490
I would rather be punished for you.

00:25:55.033 --> 00:25:57.911
I have a body forged by harsh training
and the royal martial arts.

00:25:59.746 --> 00:26:00.663
You should know that.

00:26:01.873 --> 00:26:03.083
Your Highness.

00:26:09.631 --> 00:26:11.132
Shoo!

00:26:11.633 --> 00:26:13.718
Shoo!

00:26:15.178 --> 00:26:16.721
It wasn't exactly a prison,

00:26:16.805 --> 00:26:20.392
but you came from a harsh place.
We must burn the negative energy.

00:26:20.934 --> 00:26:22.352
Are you trying to burn me too?

00:26:24.229 --> 00:26:25.563
It's all my fault.

00:26:26.231 --> 00:26:28.233
I didn't know the State Tribunal
was targeting you,

00:26:28.316 --> 00:26:30.151
and I gave them all the records.

00:26:31.152 --> 00:26:33.113
And why is that your fault?

00:26:33.196 --> 00:26:34.697
I'm the Grand Prince. It's my fault.

00:26:36.157 --> 00:26:38.034
Your Highness is so generous.

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:42.080
Aide Kang.

00:26:43.123 --> 00:26:44.416
- Here. Mugwort.
- Great.

00:26:44.499 --> 00:26:46.126
I got some more.

00:26:46.209 --> 00:26:47.168
Give it to me.

00:26:47.252 --> 00:26:48.128
Stop. It's enough.

00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:50.088
You burned away all the bad energy.

00:26:50.755 --> 00:26:53.633
Should we burn the bad energy
from the future in advance?

00:26:53.716 --> 00:26:55.093
No.

00:26:55.635 --> 00:26:57.720
I appreciate your effort, Physician Hong.

00:26:57.804 --> 00:27:00.306
Right. I wanted to ask you something.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.058
What's your relationship with Gil-dong?

00:27:04.269 --> 00:27:05.228
What?

00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:06.438
What? Why?

00:27:09.274 --> 00:27:11.234
It seems like
there's still some bad energy left.

00:27:11.317 --> 00:27:12.318
Fire.

00:27:12.819 --> 00:27:14.571
We must burn some more.

00:27:14.654 --> 00:27:16.656
I'll put it here. Now, fire.

00:27:16.739 --> 00:27:17.824
Now, fan it.

00:27:19.784 --> 00:27:23.204
Am I the only one who feels like
you're changing the topic?

00:27:27.041 --> 00:27:28.293
Why do you ask that question?

00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:30.545
Physician Hong was the one

00:27:30.628 --> 00:27:32.922
who checked Gil-dong's body.
That's why I asked.

00:27:35.091 --> 00:27:36.259
Right!

00:27:38.052 --> 00:27:40.054
I did that.

00:27:40.472 --> 00:27:42.807
Gil-dong hasn't been identified yet.

00:27:42.891 --> 00:27:44.309
It seemed like you knew him.

00:27:44.726 --> 00:27:47.395
No, I don't know him at all.

00:27:48.104 --> 00:27:50.565
But when you checked his body,

00:27:50.648 --> 00:27:52.692
you acted like the world was ending. Why?

00:27:54.611 --> 00:27:57.071
Did I…

00:27:57.155 --> 00:27:58.823
act like that?

00:27:59.782 --> 00:28:01.451
Enough of that.

00:28:02.452 --> 00:28:05.497
Her eyes were moist,
so I thought they were very close.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.706
Could you just…

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.209
I was talking to Physician Hong.

00:28:11.836 --> 00:28:13.129
I'm not sure.

00:28:13.213 --> 00:28:15.215
I wonder why.

00:28:16.424 --> 00:28:17.926
It was sweat.

00:28:18.009 --> 00:28:19.052
She ran there.

00:28:19.135 --> 00:28:20.428
I see!

00:28:20.512 --> 00:28:21.513
Running makes you hot.

00:28:21.596 --> 00:28:23.723
And when you're hot, you sweat.

00:28:24.557 --> 00:28:25.600
It sounds like

00:28:25.683 --> 00:28:28.228
you two are talking about each other.

00:28:28.937 --> 00:28:30.230
That day,

00:28:30.313 --> 00:28:33.399
I was quite emotional.

00:28:33.483 --> 00:28:35.693
Like everyone else,

00:28:35.777 --> 00:28:37.403
I felt Gil-dong was my neighbor

00:28:37.487 --> 00:28:39.280
and my brother.

00:28:39.531 --> 00:28:42.242
Right. Neighbors are
as close as your family.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:43.910
Certainly.

00:28:50.458 --> 00:28:52.794
I've always known you have a kind heart.

00:28:55.296 --> 00:28:57.841
I'm sorry I couldn't be of much help.

00:29:02.136 --> 00:29:05.640
I was just cleared of the charge
of aiding a thief,

00:29:05.723 --> 00:29:07.892
and now I've hidden the thief.

00:29:08.226 --> 00:29:09.185
Thanks.

00:29:09.435 --> 00:29:11.437
I'm sorry I made you an accomplice,

00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:16.025
but it was your moist eyes when
you saw Gil-dong that raised suspicion.

00:29:16.693 --> 00:29:19.153
And that's clearly on you.

00:29:19.237 --> 00:29:20.613
Really?

00:29:20.697 --> 00:29:22.031
So it's my fault?

00:29:22.657 --> 00:29:23.491
You may be right.

00:29:23.575 --> 00:29:26.160
I shouldn't have let Gil-dong go
in the first place.

00:29:26.244 --> 00:29:28.079
When I first met him,

00:29:28.162 --> 00:29:30.290
I should've unmasked him
and checked his face first.

00:29:32.625 --> 00:29:36.087
Then, I would've been able to protect you
without all this trouble.

00:29:41.968 --> 00:29:44.596
You're getting sidetracked.

00:29:45.263 --> 00:29:46.598
No, we're finally back on track.

00:29:47.515 --> 00:29:50.310
We haven't even gotten
to the main point yet.

00:29:51.895 --> 00:29:52.896
Follow me.

00:29:55.231 --> 00:29:56.608
So I'm telling you in advance.

00:29:57.233 --> 00:29:59.652
From now on,
I will be even more relentless.

00:29:59.736 --> 00:30:01.905
I will not hesitate even for a moment.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.915
Are you heading to the capital?

00:30:11.998 --> 00:30:14.083
It'd be better to stay the night
and leave tomorrow.

00:30:14.167 --> 00:30:16.002
I received a letter telling me to hurry.

00:30:16.085 --> 00:30:17.378
I'll stop by on my way south.

00:30:21.257 --> 00:30:22.258
Why do you think

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.885
we returned to our bodies?

00:30:25.345 --> 00:30:26.721
Did you do anything special?

00:30:29.432 --> 00:30:30.975
No, what about you?

00:30:31.559 --> 00:30:32.685
Me neither.

00:30:36.898 --> 00:30:38.066
What if…

00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:40.109
We didn't do anything special
to cause it either.

00:30:40.193 --> 00:30:42.153
Don't think too much. Just accept it.

00:30:42.236 --> 00:30:43.821
That's what I'm trying to do.

00:30:44.489 --> 00:30:46.574
Did something happen
when you were in my body?

00:30:46.658 --> 00:30:48.660
If there's anything I should know,
tell me now.

00:30:49.744 --> 00:30:52.121
I may have made some mistakes,

00:30:52.205 --> 00:30:53.706
but nothing major.

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:54.916
What about you?

00:30:54.999 --> 00:30:56.542
I have a warning for you.

00:31:02.173 --> 00:31:03.633
A latch?

00:31:06.302 --> 00:31:07.220
There are

00:31:07.303 --> 00:31:08.471
wolves around the annex.

00:31:09.138 --> 00:31:10.515
Wolves?

00:31:10.598 --> 00:31:13.059
Not wild boars? Where do they come from?

00:31:13.726 --> 00:31:16.187
It seemed like
they were from Bugak Mountain.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.774
Anyway, make sure
the doors are closed at night.

00:31:19.857 --> 00:31:23.111
I'm telling you this for the sake
of your body, which used to be mine.

00:31:24.195 --> 00:31:25.071
Thank you.

00:31:26.781 --> 00:31:27.865
And sorry.

00:31:30.868 --> 00:31:33.663
You were arrested because of Gil-dong.

00:31:34.288 --> 00:31:35.790
I was so sorry

00:31:36.499 --> 00:31:38.501
that I couldn't say it was me.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.171
Let me make this clear.

00:31:42.255 --> 00:31:43.381
What happened was

00:31:43.464 --> 00:31:44.799
a petty thief got mixed up

00:31:44.882 --> 00:31:47.301
with a scoundrel at the constabulary

00:31:47.385 --> 00:31:49.262
and ended up being a political pawn.

00:31:49.345 --> 00:31:50.179
Why?

00:31:50.263 --> 00:31:53.141
Because that scoundrel
happened to be a Grand Prince.

00:31:53.641 --> 00:31:54.684
So all you need to do

00:31:54.767 --> 00:31:58.021
is complain about
getting dragged into this damn mess

00:31:58.104 --> 00:32:00.148
because of me.

00:32:03.818 --> 00:32:05.570
Now, shall we return to our lives?

00:32:07.655 --> 00:32:10.241
Is that all you wanted to say?

00:32:10.825 --> 00:32:12.326
Do you have anything else to say?

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:13.369
No, I don't.

00:32:37.727 --> 00:32:39.729
What's driving me crazy right now

00:32:40.104 --> 00:32:41.647
is that I'm not in my own body,

00:32:41.731 --> 00:32:45.151
so I can't even just go and drag you
out of that family like a tyrant.

00:32:47.487 --> 00:32:50.114
He said all kinds of things
while wearing my face.

00:32:51.866 --> 00:32:53.618
He must've gone through

00:32:53.701 --> 00:32:55.995
all kinds of things
while wearing my face too.

00:32:58.456 --> 00:33:00.458
He must have realized,

00:33:01.125 --> 00:33:02.502
that with me,

00:33:06.589 --> 00:33:08.466
that's just how things should be.

00:33:29.362 --> 00:33:32.073
Keep a low profile
until things quieten down.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.453
You're not someone
who normally backs down this easily.

00:33:38.079 --> 00:33:40.623
Does Grand Prince Dowol
have something on you?

00:33:45.878 --> 00:33:48.422
I will just lie low
and wait for your command.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.884
You want us to secretly
track down Gil-dong on our own?

00:33:52.301 --> 00:33:53.302
But he's dead.

00:33:53.678 --> 00:33:55.138
The Grand Prince is alive.

00:33:55.596 --> 00:33:59.225
I feel like
he's pretty close with that thief.

00:33:59.684 --> 00:34:00.685
So?

00:34:01.602 --> 00:34:02.645
That's why.

00:34:02.728 --> 00:34:03.563
Come on.

00:34:03.646 --> 00:34:06.232
You're supposed to stay away
from anything related to Gil-dong.

00:34:06.315 --> 00:34:09.360
Your father gave you that order.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:10.653
That's why.

00:34:11.154 --> 00:34:12.196
"That's why?"

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.614
I feel like this case

00:34:13.698 --> 00:34:16.534
could destroy one of the two
once we dig into it.

00:34:17.577 --> 00:34:19.537
It would be best if it destroyed both.

00:34:20.288 --> 00:34:22.165
I hear he's Jae-i of the Im family.

00:34:22.999 --> 00:34:25.418
That insolent son of the Chief Secretary

00:34:25.877 --> 00:34:27.628
will have to face my punishment.

00:34:27.712 --> 00:34:30.256
I hate everything about him,
but his eyes are the worst.

00:34:30.882 --> 00:34:32.758
When you look at me,

00:34:32.842 --> 00:34:34.552
I see turmoil in your eyes.

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.597
Those eyes were full of desire.

00:34:40.308 --> 00:34:41.809
What are you saying?

00:34:42.476 --> 00:34:45.021
Shall we take this chance
and exile him tomorrow?

00:34:46.147 --> 00:34:47.440
He insulted the royal family,

00:34:48.733 --> 00:34:50.193
so he will be beheaded.

00:34:50.902 --> 00:34:52.236
That should prevent any fallout.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.030
Eliminating a political rival.

00:34:54.113 --> 00:34:55.656
What do you mean?

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.326
Mother, you need not
get blood on your hands.

00:34:59.035 --> 00:35:00.453
I will take care of this.

00:35:01.495 --> 00:35:02.622
What will you do?

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.248
Just a latch won't do.

00:35:04.874 --> 00:35:05.833
A latch?

00:35:05.917 --> 00:35:10.254
Even now, he must be prowling
around the annex like a wolf.

00:35:24.727 --> 00:35:26.020
There are

00:35:26.103 --> 00:35:27.521
wolves around the annex.

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:33.569
So he was right?

00:35:39.992 --> 00:35:41.035
Oh, dear!

00:35:49.335 --> 00:35:51.545
Those herbs are for my mother.
Can I get a little extra?

00:35:51.629 --> 00:35:52.797
Come on.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.882
I was going to give you a little extra.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:58.678
Move! Make way!

00:35:58.761 --> 00:35:59.679
This way!

00:35:59.762 --> 00:36:02.223
- Move!
- Make way!

00:36:02.306 --> 00:36:04.517
This way! Move!

00:36:07.186 --> 00:36:09.355
Did something happen at the Hyeminseo?

00:36:09.897 --> 00:36:11.023
HYEMINSEO

00:36:20.491 --> 00:36:21.534
Jeom-baek!

00:36:21.617 --> 00:36:22.493
Eun-jo!

00:36:23.786 --> 00:36:25.413
Why is everyone wearing a face covering?

00:36:26.122 --> 00:36:27.540
- Is there a plague?
- Yes.

00:36:27.623 --> 00:36:29.333
A plague is spreading outside the capital.

00:36:29.417 --> 00:36:32.795
Everyone insists
they've caught the plague.

00:36:32.878 --> 00:36:34.547
It's a mess.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.048
Let me help.

00:36:36.132 --> 00:36:37.925
I need to ask the Superintendent first.

00:36:38.009 --> 00:36:38.843
Where is he?

00:36:42.305 --> 00:36:44.223
No man of any respectable family

00:36:44.307 --> 00:36:47.184
would accept a woman
cast off by a broken engagement.

00:36:47.268 --> 00:36:49.103
You must have also heard

00:36:49.186 --> 00:36:52.064
that the Chief Secretary's second son
had the Grand Prince arrested.

00:36:52.857 --> 00:36:54.984
Who do you think was behind it?

00:36:55.568 --> 00:36:56.694
It was the Chief Secretary.

00:36:56.777 --> 00:36:58.946
The moment His Majesty changes his mind,

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:01.490
he could be cast off at any time,
just as in the Gyeongo Year.

00:37:01.574 --> 00:37:05.578
Must you really marry Hae-rim
into that family, knowing the risk?

00:37:08.247 --> 00:37:09.707
I will convey Your Majesty's will.

00:37:15.838 --> 00:37:16.964
Brother,

00:37:17.548 --> 00:37:21.052
you said the Hyeminseo is busy
because of the plague outside the capital.

00:37:21.135 --> 00:37:22.553
Let me help.

00:37:24.847 --> 00:37:26.390
We do not need you.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:38.486
Just as Your Highness suspected,
Gil-dong's body is gone.

00:37:39.111 --> 00:37:40.654
Who did this?

00:37:41.614 --> 00:37:42.990
As a matter of fact,

00:37:43.616 --> 00:37:45.534
on the day Gil-dong's body was buried,

00:37:46.118 --> 00:37:48.496
I saw someone suspicious around here.

00:37:48.579 --> 00:37:50.247
- What?
- I know.

00:37:50.331 --> 00:37:51.248
I saw them too.

00:37:51.374 --> 00:37:52.208
- What?
- What?

00:37:53.459 --> 00:37:56.337
I mean, I can vividly picture
what I just heard.

00:37:56.962 --> 00:37:58.964
Why are you reporting that only now?

00:37:59.048 --> 00:37:59.924
I apologize.

00:38:00.007 --> 00:38:02.635
I thought it wouldn't be a big deal.

00:38:03.469 --> 00:38:04.720
I knew it.

00:38:04.804 --> 00:38:06.722
It's just as bad as I expected.

00:38:10.476 --> 00:38:12.603
Find a warrior with a scar like this.

00:38:13.396 --> 00:38:16.148
If you find him, don't arrest him.
Report it to me discreetly.

00:38:20.403 --> 00:38:21.946
Will you track down the fake Gil-dong?

00:38:22.029 --> 00:38:23.280
Yes.

00:38:23.364 --> 00:38:25.783
I need to know who it was so I feel…

00:38:27.201 --> 00:38:28.077
"Fake Gil-dong"?

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.621
Hong-si is the real Gil-dong.

00:38:31.455 --> 00:38:32.623
Hong-si?

00:38:32.706 --> 00:38:34.959
What are you talking about?

00:38:35.584 --> 00:38:36.752
She's a woman.

00:38:36.836 --> 00:38:39.338
How could a woman
possibly steal things in Joseon?

00:38:39.422 --> 00:38:41.090
I couldn't believe it at first either.

00:38:41.173 --> 00:38:43.759
Your Highness is suspected
of freeing Gil-dong, the thief.

00:38:43.843 --> 00:38:47.179
Even when Hong-si
flinched at the name Gil-dong,

00:38:47.263 --> 00:38:48.472
I just brushed it off.

00:38:48.556 --> 00:38:50.141
What's your relationship with Gil-dong?

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:52.184
What?

00:38:52.268 --> 00:38:53.352
What? Why?

00:38:53.436 --> 00:38:55.438
Even when she turned pale and panicked,

00:38:55.521 --> 00:38:57.481
I thought it didn't make any sense.

00:38:57.565 --> 00:38:59.191
And?

00:38:59.275 --> 00:39:01.777
Seeing you bristle
at a mere probing question,

00:39:01.861 --> 00:39:04.029
without even asking why,

00:39:04.113 --> 00:39:05.489
convinced me.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.162
You won't report her, will you?

00:39:12.496 --> 00:39:14.331
I take the law seriously.

00:39:14.415 --> 00:39:15.791
Dae-chu, think about it.

00:39:15.875 --> 00:39:18.752
If she gets arrested,
I, your lord, will get arrested too.

00:39:18.836 --> 00:39:20.254
Then you will lose your job,

00:39:20.337 --> 00:39:21.881
and your parents will be furious.

00:39:21.964 --> 00:39:24.633
They both passed away when I was ten.

00:39:24.717 --> 00:39:25.926
Their souls will be sad.

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:27.595
Let me ask you one question.

00:39:27.678 --> 00:39:30.347
What are you going to do with Hong-si
from now on?

00:39:32.433 --> 00:39:35.519
We're partners in crime now.
We'll have to share the same fate.

00:39:35.603 --> 00:39:37.271
You must be excited to be her accomplice.

00:39:37.354 --> 00:39:38.230
Excited?

00:39:38.314 --> 00:39:39.773
I'm stuck with her now.

00:39:39.857 --> 00:39:41.484
So you're thrilled to be stuck with her.

00:39:41.567 --> 00:39:42.485
Thrilled?

00:39:42.568 --> 00:39:44.737
It's such a burden. I'm dead tired.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.739
If Your Highness dies,

00:39:46.822 --> 00:39:48.532
I will lose my job

00:39:48.616 --> 00:39:50.409
and my parents' souls will be sad.

00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:54.830
Shall I take care of it?

00:39:55.122 --> 00:39:56.415
Before that,

00:39:57.291 --> 00:39:59.460
shall I take care of you first?

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.513
I was told to go to the constabulary
to find Your Highness.

00:40:15.518 --> 00:40:17.520
I've been awaiting your command for days.

00:40:17.603 --> 00:40:20.064
There has been no command, so I came.

00:40:20.147 --> 00:40:22.149
It was your father's order,

00:40:22.233 --> 00:40:23.359
so it's your father's doing.

00:40:24.527 --> 00:40:27.238
His son doesn't
have to bear the consequences.

00:40:31.659 --> 00:40:33.827
It would be petty to punish the son.

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:36.080
So just live.

00:40:38.457 --> 00:40:41.794
An order to live
sounds harsher than an order to die.

00:40:41.877 --> 00:40:43.879
Then live a harsh life.

00:40:48.926 --> 00:40:50.135
Hong Eun-jo

00:40:50.219 --> 00:40:52.054
is a married woman.

00:40:52.555 --> 00:40:54.848
It seems
you don't quite understand the situation.

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.601
I don't understand what?

00:40:57.685 --> 00:41:00.104
In this game,
it's the woman who bears the stigma

00:41:02.273 --> 00:41:03.691
of being toyed with by royalty.

00:41:04.358 --> 00:41:06.235
And she will be despised for life.

00:41:10.781 --> 00:41:12.783
Your family married her off
to a dying man.

00:41:13.367 --> 00:41:16.620
That is what toying with someone
looks like.

00:41:17.288 --> 00:41:18.414
You people knew it.

00:41:19.498 --> 00:41:20.332
So

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:22.543
it must be turned back.

00:41:40.227 --> 00:41:42.062
The water to brew the tonic
for the patients?

00:41:42.813 --> 00:41:43.814
Yes.

00:41:48.027 --> 00:41:49.737
Are you new here?

00:41:50.362 --> 00:41:51.614
Well…

00:41:53.073 --> 00:41:54.033
I…

00:41:54.116 --> 00:41:55.367
Hae-rim!

00:41:56.785 --> 00:41:57.661
I mean…

00:41:57.745 --> 00:41:58.787
Lady Hae-rim.

00:41:58.871 --> 00:42:00.539
Do you know me?

00:42:01.415 --> 00:42:04.043
You're the Superintendent's sister.

00:42:04.126 --> 00:42:06.587
I think I've seen you in passing
a few times.

00:42:11.717 --> 00:42:12.676
Right.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.428
We met at the palace, right?

00:42:14.511 --> 00:42:18.474
Wait, you were wearing
a court lady's dress then.

00:42:18.557 --> 00:42:19.975
Oh, that.

00:42:20.643 --> 00:42:21.894
That day…

00:42:23.312 --> 00:42:25.022
I had my reasons.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.316
I see.

00:42:29.151 --> 00:42:30.944
And why are you wearing

00:42:31.028 --> 00:42:33.030
a physician's uniform?

00:42:34.406 --> 00:42:35.616
Right.

00:42:36.575 --> 00:42:38.702
I have my reasons too.

00:42:39.119 --> 00:42:41.413
The man you broke off your engagement with

00:42:41.497 --> 00:42:43.248
was the Chief Secretary's second son?

00:42:45.876 --> 00:42:48.295
If you are
his dead grandfather's concubine,

00:42:48.379 --> 00:42:50.506
does that make you his grandmother?

00:42:51.465 --> 00:42:54.635
A concubine's name
is not even entered in the family records.

00:42:54.718 --> 00:42:57.805
I was taken in merely as a caretaker.

00:43:00.808 --> 00:43:02.976
You may think it's a luxury

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.104
for a noblewoman to complain,

00:43:05.187 --> 00:43:07.481
but I feel marriage
is a tricky matter for women.

00:43:11.568 --> 00:43:14.154
Our problems may seem different,

00:43:14.238 --> 00:43:16.198
but, in essence, they might be the same.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:25.499
How strange.
Somehow, it feels like we have met before.

00:43:25.874 --> 00:43:27.418
You probably don't know what I mean.

00:43:29.628 --> 00:43:32.798
I might understand more than I know.

00:43:34.258 --> 00:43:35.634
How strange.

00:43:35.718 --> 00:43:37.845
It feels like we've known each other
for a long time.

00:43:38.679 --> 00:43:41.181
Maybe it isn't just a feeling.

00:43:44.268 --> 00:43:47.312
Actually, I lost my friends
when my engagement was broken off,

00:43:47.396 --> 00:43:49.273
and I've been pretty upset lately.

00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:53.485
Don't be so upset.

00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:56.697
Sometimes, one misfortune
chases away another.

00:43:59.283 --> 00:44:00.993
Would you be my friend?

00:44:08.041 --> 00:44:09.626
Hasn't he arrived home yet?

00:44:13.797 --> 00:44:14.757
What are you doing?

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.884
You're home early today, Young Master.

00:44:17.509 --> 00:44:20.137
Why do you call me Young Master?

00:44:23.098 --> 00:44:24.600
I'm here to meet Lord Hong Min-jik.

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:27.644
My father is away in the provinces
at the moment.

00:44:28.228 --> 00:44:29.730
He won't be back till next year.

00:44:29.813 --> 00:44:32.274
He'll be home in a few days.
I'll come back then.

00:44:34.443 --> 00:44:35.486
What…

00:44:37.362 --> 00:44:38.238
Who are you?

00:44:38.322 --> 00:44:40.532
Why were you peeking into my house?

00:44:41.366 --> 00:44:42.367
"You"?

00:44:43.243 --> 00:44:45.788
I'll say this nicely, for old times' sake.

00:44:45.871 --> 00:44:46.830
Let go of me.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:51.001
What are you doing?

00:44:51.919 --> 00:44:53.754
Eun-jo, report this man
to the constabulary.

00:44:53.837 --> 00:44:55.422
I caught a thief.

00:44:55.506 --> 00:44:56.423
What?

00:44:56.507 --> 00:44:59.259
This scoundrel was peeking into our house.

00:44:59.343 --> 00:45:00.344
- "Scoundrel"?
- See?

00:45:00.427 --> 00:45:02.638
That's the look of someone
caught red-handed.

00:45:02.721 --> 00:45:04.515
I'm sure that's someone else's look.

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:07.976
Young Master,

00:45:08.519 --> 00:45:11.813
why would a thief come to our place?
There's nothing to steal here.

00:45:12.564 --> 00:45:16.485
Everything our family owns would be
worth less than what he's wearing.

00:45:20.656 --> 00:45:21.573
You're right.

00:45:24.701 --> 00:45:27.287
I've been really patient today.

00:45:29.373 --> 00:45:30.290
My apologies.

00:45:30.374 --> 00:45:33.168
I'm a little sensitive
because people say there's a thief around.

00:45:33.627 --> 00:45:36.672
What's his name? Was it Gil-dong?

00:45:38.507 --> 00:45:39.925
That thief?

00:45:41.093 --> 00:45:42.344
I know him well.

00:45:44.179 --> 00:45:45.472
What a world we live in.

00:45:45.556 --> 00:45:48.892
They say even the Grand Prince
took the thief's side.

00:45:48.976 --> 00:45:51.103
What was he even thinking--

00:45:55.774 --> 00:45:56.733
What?

00:45:57.568 --> 00:45:59.236
PATIENCE

00:45:59.319 --> 00:46:02.489
Just know that I saved your life.

00:46:09.204 --> 00:46:10.872
As I said earlier,

00:46:11.665 --> 00:46:14.585
Young Master is not a mean person.

00:46:15.294 --> 00:46:16.920
He's not a mean person?

00:46:17.004 --> 00:46:17.963
He's a mindless person.

00:46:18.046 --> 00:46:20.215
How could he mistake
someone like me for a thief?

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.468
So, why did you peek into my house…

00:46:24.177 --> 00:46:26.388
I mean, what brings you here?

00:46:27.514 --> 00:46:28.432
Perhaps…

00:46:29.683 --> 00:46:31.560
Were you waiting for me?

00:46:36.857 --> 00:46:39.610
You cannot just show up
without notice like this.

00:46:39.693 --> 00:46:41.445
I have a family.

00:46:42.738 --> 00:46:43.864
Don't get me wrong.

00:46:43.947 --> 00:46:45.365
I was only passing by.

00:46:46.158 --> 00:46:47.784
And they were my family too.

00:46:48.785 --> 00:46:50.954
So you happened to pass by
my family's house.

00:46:53.123 --> 00:46:55.292
Is your family doing all right?

00:46:55.709 --> 00:46:57.753
Maybe they grew on me
after we lived together.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.880
I wonder how they're doing.

00:46:59.963 --> 00:47:01.214
Who?

00:47:01.882 --> 00:47:03.216
The doorkeeper?

00:47:04.009 --> 00:47:05.802
Seok-sam?

00:47:05.886 --> 00:47:06.928
No.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.473
Im Jae-i.

00:47:10.807 --> 00:47:12.476
How generous of you.

00:47:12.559 --> 00:47:15.646
You wonder how the man
who arrested you is doing.

00:47:16.897 --> 00:47:18.982
That's how generous a Grand Prince is.

00:47:20.942 --> 00:47:23.612
I'm afraid
I can't pass along your regards.

00:47:23.987 --> 00:47:25.822
I haven't seen him around
these past few days.

00:47:25.906 --> 00:47:27.032
Really?

00:47:27.115 --> 00:47:29.993
If you're that curious,
I'll see if I can meet him today.

00:47:30.327 --> 00:47:31.870
Curious, my foot.

00:47:32.746 --> 00:47:34.665
I would banish him to a deserted island,

00:47:34.748 --> 00:47:37.084
but I'm holding back
because I don't want to be petty.

00:47:43.882 --> 00:47:45.467
You're using the latch, right?

00:47:54.893 --> 00:47:57.062
The Shin family
broke off the engagement in writing.

00:47:57.145 --> 00:47:58.313
Was it you?

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:01.525
I'm too proud

00:48:01.608 --> 00:48:04.361
to be sold off as a breeding horse,

00:48:04.444 --> 00:48:05.821
and I'm so greedy

00:48:05.904 --> 00:48:10.200
that I can't let go of the name, wealth
and fame you've given me.

00:48:10.283 --> 00:48:11.410
Do I have any choice

00:48:11.493 --> 00:48:14.788
but to cling to my soft-hearted fiancée?

00:48:16.081 --> 00:48:17.666
After all,

00:48:18.583 --> 00:48:21.378
the blood you carry
is unfit for human duties.

00:48:22.754 --> 00:48:24.005
You acted like an animal,

00:48:25.757 --> 00:48:27.718
so you will be treated like one.

00:48:31.722 --> 00:48:33.807
At this rate, he will die!

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:35.934
Find the First Young Master! Now!

00:48:36.017 --> 00:48:37.144
- Hurry!
- Come on!

00:48:39.646 --> 00:48:41.189
- Ma'am.
- Eun-jo!

00:48:41.273 --> 00:48:42.607
Where is everyone going?

00:48:42.691 --> 00:48:44.860
Something awful is happening
in the men's quarters.

00:48:44.943 --> 00:48:47.154
I must find the First Young Master.

00:48:52.826 --> 00:48:54.286
What's going on?

00:48:54.369 --> 00:48:58.290
The Lord has been beating
the Second Young Master all day.

00:49:01.585 --> 00:49:04.379
There's no one in this house
who can stop him.

00:49:07.007 --> 00:49:08.175
I will go and see.

00:49:24.649 --> 00:49:25.859
Get lost.

00:49:42.876 --> 00:49:45.879
Lock Jae-i in the storehouse
and don't give him any food or water.

00:50:16.493 --> 00:50:17.828
It's a tonic.

00:50:20.372 --> 00:50:21.331
If you'll excuse me.

00:50:37.556 --> 00:50:39.099
Oh, dear.

00:50:42.727 --> 00:50:43.937
You are permitted to come out.

00:50:52.445 --> 00:50:53.363
Are you all right?

00:50:55.323 --> 00:50:56.408
Yes, thanks to you.

00:50:58.201 --> 00:50:59.619
You should thank Eun…

00:51:02.372 --> 00:51:04.040
I mean, the lady of the annex.

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:32.444
She brewed the tonic
the whole night last night.

00:51:33.403 --> 00:51:36.114
And she's been brewing another one
since early this morning.

00:51:37.365 --> 00:51:38.450
What are you doing?

00:51:39.993 --> 00:51:41.202
How are you feeling?

00:51:41.286 --> 00:51:42.370
I said, what are you doing?

00:51:44.915 --> 00:51:47.792
You shouldn't be moving around yet.
It'll worsen your wound.

00:51:57.469 --> 00:51:58.303
Are you pitying me?

00:51:59.596 --> 00:52:00.972
Why are you so twisted?

00:52:01.056 --> 00:52:02.182
I was just worried--

00:52:02.265 --> 00:52:04.100
Whether out of pity or worry, don't do it.

00:52:04.184 --> 00:52:05.644
Do you think we're really family?

00:52:06.811 --> 00:52:09.064
I'm not trying to act like your family.

00:52:09.147 --> 00:52:10.607
Why are you even doing this?

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:11.942
No matter who you are,

00:52:12.025 --> 00:52:14.694
if you're sick, you get treated,

00:52:14.778 --> 00:52:16.071
regardless of personal feelings.

00:52:22.577 --> 00:52:25.038
If you don't like
that I'm the one brewing the tonic,

00:52:25.121 --> 00:52:26.957
I can ask the doorkeeper to do it.

00:52:29.542 --> 00:52:31.294
What a waste.

00:52:43.264 --> 00:52:44.766
What is your problem?

00:52:44.849 --> 00:52:46.518
That's what I want to ask you.

00:52:46.601 --> 00:52:47.936
What is your problem?

00:52:54.776 --> 00:52:55.902
Let go of me.

00:52:57.696 --> 00:52:59.364
I said, let go of me.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.243
This is a warning.

00:53:03.827 --> 00:53:06.121
Don't try to spread warmth in this house.

00:53:07.163 --> 00:53:08.915
In this house,

00:53:10.709 --> 00:53:12.043
keep that worry

00:53:13.545 --> 00:53:15.213
to yourself.

00:53:15.296 --> 00:53:17.173
Don't make me care

00:53:19.134 --> 00:53:21.428
about this damned family.

00:53:22.804 --> 00:53:24.097
What do you…

00:53:36.317 --> 00:53:37.485
Eun-jo.

00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:39.154
What happened?

00:53:42.032 --> 00:53:43.783
I accidentally knocked it over.

00:53:44.284 --> 00:53:46.244
I'll go and buy more herbs.

00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:51.499
I trust Your Highness
will keep peace in the palace

00:53:51.583 --> 00:53:53.334
while we are away.

00:53:53.418 --> 00:53:55.545
It will be at least a month.

00:53:56.755 --> 00:53:57.881
Let us set off.

00:54:13.063 --> 00:54:14.147
Wait.

00:54:15.231 --> 00:54:17.984
The Chief Secretary and his eldest son
are joining this trip too.

00:54:18.068 --> 00:54:19.194
That means

00:54:19.277 --> 00:54:21.613
he'll be alone with Eun-jo in that house.

00:54:23.364 --> 00:54:26.493
I will join the king's procession
at the palace gate.

00:54:26.576 --> 00:54:28.870
Wouldn't it be better if I joined you?

00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:32.332
I want you to stay here
and take care of what I asked you to.

00:54:32.999 --> 00:54:34.042
Yes, Father.

00:54:37.253 --> 00:54:39.089
You must be setting out on a long journey.

00:54:39.172 --> 00:54:40.173
Yes.

00:54:40.548 --> 00:54:42.675
I'm going to the Onyang Royal Villa.

00:54:42.759 --> 00:54:44.636
I wish you a safe trip.

00:54:46.096 --> 00:54:47.097
Let's go.

00:55:00.318 --> 00:55:01.569
My lord.

00:55:04.114 --> 00:55:05.990
Why did you come back?

00:55:06.074 --> 00:55:08.159
I received Eun-jo's letter.

00:55:08.243 --> 00:55:09.661
Eun-jo sent a letter?

00:55:10.537 --> 00:55:13.623
I met her yesterday,
but she didn't mention any letter.

00:55:13.706 --> 00:55:15.834
It was sent the day after the wedding.

00:55:15.917 --> 00:55:17.752
She wrote that it was urgent.
What happened?

00:55:19.045 --> 00:55:21.256
Are you sure it was from Eun-jo?

00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:23.591
You earned this.

00:55:25.385 --> 00:55:29.264
Because of your lack of virtue,
my grandfather passed away.

00:55:30.306 --> 00:55:32.350
So accept it as what you deserve.

00:55:37.021 --> 00:55:38.648
And now,

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:40.233
this is for your father.

00:55:41.025 --> 00:55:43.069
He earned a big one.

00:55:45.822 --> 00:55:46.906
Did you just grab me?

00:55:47.365 --> 00:55:48.449
Let go.

00:55:53.079 --> 00:55:56.207
I can take a beating.
You can beat me if you want,

00:55:56.291 --> 00:55:58.126
but in my lord's name,

00:55:58.209 --> 00:56:00.253
I will not accept a single blow.

00:56:00.336 --> 00:56:02.797
You must have really lost your mind.

00:56:30.408 --> 00:56:31.743
Your Highness.

00:56:31.826 --> 00:56:32.994
Sorry.

00:56:33.786 --> 00:56:35.496
My hand slipped.

00:56:35.872 --> 00:56:36.915
That was a mistake.

00:56:38.124 --> 00:56:39.834
I was aiming for your head.

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.885
Why are you doing this?

00:56:48.968 --> 00:56:50.011
Stand up.

00:56:50.678 --> 00:56:52.347
There will be no more mistakes.

00:57:00.021 --> 00:57:00.855
Stop it.

00:57:03.524 --> 00:57:04.776
Please stop.

00:57:42.564 --> 00:57:45.024
I was going to give you this
once you left this family,

00:57:46.276 --> 00:57:47.569
but I changed my mind.

00:58:07.755 --> 00:58:08.965
This…

00:58:11.092 --> 00:58:12.302
What is it?

00:58:12.385 --> 00:58:15.138
Something I should have done
the moment I returned to my body.

00:58:15.221 --> 00:58:16.347
It's my declaration of war.

00:58:17.682 --> 00:58:19.267
It is my determination

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:21.978
to face the long
and exhausting fight that lies ahead

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:25.648
between two enemies,
the old customs and the gap of status.

00:58:26.774 --> 00:58:29.444
It's the only justification I have

00:58:29.861 --> 00:58:31.237
to save you

00:58:31.321 --> 00:58:32.614

{\an8}Grand Prince Dowol?

01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:05.850
{\an8}Please never come back.

{\an8}Today, I'll do it as much as I can.

01:01:17.695 --> 01:01:21.491
{\an8}They've given the order to kill
all the sick here and shut the place down.

01:01:21.574 --> 01:01:22.867
{\an8}I can never forget her.

01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:24.076
