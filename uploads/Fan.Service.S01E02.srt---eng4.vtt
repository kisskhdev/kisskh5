00:00:01.026 --> 00:00:03.026
What do you think you're doing?

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.755
(Tarot Reading See your destiny)

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.259
You think this is my first time
dealing with people like you?

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.070
People like me?

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:37.299
What did I even do?

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.290
Just because you're a star,

00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:40.714
you think you can do whatever you want?

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:41.999
Isn't it you, though...

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.457
The one sending those disgusting
letters to my house.

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:46.939
Following me like a shadow
and selling photos like a creep.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.259
I said it wasn't me!

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.779
Okay, okay, everyone calm down.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.901
I need to get home for my cat's livestream.

00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:03.465
Are you mocking me right now?

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.749
At least you're decent looking.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.509
"Handsome", my ass...

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.525
You look like a cat's nut sack.

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:13.169
Hey! That's verbal abuse!

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.020
That's an insult!

00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:15.539
I'm suing him!

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600
Geonwoo!!!

00:01:20.594 --> 00:01:21.815
Are... are you okay?

00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:23.379
Wh-wh-what happened?!

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.799
Call my lawyer.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.361
Uh... I was going to...

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.689
You think I don't have a lawyer?

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.838
What do you need a lawyer for?

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:34.300
This is exactly when you need one.

00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:36.442
I have one too, just you wait.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.070
(That law school kid! Finally useful.
(I'm being framed. Give me your number.)

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.339
Pick three cards.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.840
What?

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.910
But where are you...

00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:51.792
Focus on your question first.

00:01:51.793 --> 00:01:54.494
Then pick three from the table.

00:01:54.495 --> 00:01:56.495
Oh...

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:05.070
Will Jaeyeon like me?

00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:26.013
Pick one more.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.882
Hmm... you'll get one chance.

00:02:34.883 --> 00:02:35.883
What?

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.900
If you miss that moment,
you'll be friends forever...

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.819
(That law school kid! Finally useful.
(I'm being framed. Give me your number.)

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.540
(Calling Jaeyeon)

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.050
It was 20,000 won, though.
(T/N: He only gave 10,000 won.)

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.321
Lawyer! Over here!

00:03:01.675 --> 00:03:02.560
Hey, what's going on?

00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:05.892
Taewoo, he keeps calling me a creep...

00:03:05.893 --> 00:03:07.549
A stalker...!

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.919
Jaeyeon?

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.149
What's going on here?

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.949
You brought him here?

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.163
Jaeyeon?

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.217
You.

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:19.933
What did you do to my brother?

00:03:19.934 --> 00:03:20.979
Bullshit...

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.339
What's really going on?

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.650
Yeah, what the hell...?

00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:25.672
What happened?

00:03:27.434 --> 00:03:31.277
I got the CCTV footage.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.239
Should we take a look?

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.300
Fine, play it.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.275
This guy...

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.061
I don't think he's a stalker...

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.599
Really?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.120
"Really"?!

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.838
Here's your chance.

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.474
What...?

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:02.735
An interview.

00:04:02.736 --> 00:04:04.536
Forget the apology,
get an interview instead.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.479
I know my brother.

00:04:08.726 --> 00:04:10.769
Don't expect a sincere apology from him.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:11.939
I can apologize for Geonwoo...

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.653
No, it's fine.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.179
How about some compensation then?

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.819
Is a million won enough?

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.250
Better than an apology, right?

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.194
Forget it...!

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.729
Just do one thing for me.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.290
Do it with me!

00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:42.055
Do what...?

00:04:42.056 --> 00:04:44.652
Wh-wh-what exactly?

00:04:44.653 --> 00:04:46.429
An interview... an interview!

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.121
He stutters when he's nervous...

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.430
Thirty minutes is all I need!

00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:52.792
Just a thirty-minute interview.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.267
Tomorrow at 4 PM, at my place.

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:03.370
Send him the address.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.757
About what happened earlier.

00:05:11.758 --> 00:05:13.779
I wanted to apologize for him...

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.369
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.699
He's just like that sometimes.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.148
But he has his reasons.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.579
He's lucky.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.440
Huh?

00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:28.740
He always has someone on his side.

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:30.460
Hey!

00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:31.769
I'm on your side!

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.099
I'll always be on your side!

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.569
You'd better stay on my side then.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.959
Here's my number.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.112
Text me, and I'll send the address.

00:05:40.113 --> 00:05:42.020
Okay, okay.

00:05:42.021 --> 00:05:44.044
So...

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.270
Taewoo!

00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:53.445
Yeah?

00:05:53.446 --> 00:05:56.000
He wasn't always like that.

00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:57.263
What?

00:05:57.264 --> 00:05:59.659
Your brother...

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:04.631
Never mind... see you later.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.709
Are you an angel?

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.600
Yeah, pretty much.

00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:24.169
Then can I have the other popsicle too?

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.359
Don't be greedy.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.679
And here I thought you were an angel.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.209
You're the type who'd
steal an angel's underwear.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.769
That text scared the life out of me.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.459
When they said they'd call a lawyer,

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.449
I got nervous too.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.680
Is that why you said I was a lawyer?

00:06:41.681 --> 00:06:43.489
Yeah.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.039
That's fraud, you know.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.049
Whatever.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.180
It worked out in the end, anyway.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.809
So why is it so awkward
between you and your brother?

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.339
Didn't you just see why?

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.639
Yeah, I guess...

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.699
You know my parents are divorced, right?

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.519
Yeah, I know.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.289
Did you know my dad went to prison?

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.549
I didn't... wait, what?

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:10.559
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.249
Did I act too surprised?

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.209
A little bit, yeah.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.379
But why?

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.822
My brother's the one who reported him.

00:07:17.823 --> 00:07:19.519
What?

00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:25.712
After the divorce,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.419
my brother blew up as a child star.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.650
My mom was always busy with him.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.579
My dad still came to see me sometimes...

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.170
At least I had him.

00:07:38.171 --> 00:07:40.610
I didn't feel as lonely...

00:07:41.975 --> 00:07:44.499
But maybe he missed my brother too.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.574
He'd just take him away without a word.

00:07:49.233 --> 00:07:51.689
Hey... is it okay for me to hear all this?

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.841
If it's not you , then who else is going to listen?

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.809
My mom and brother reported him.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.249
He ended up in prison.

00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:06.191
Truthfully, that's just what my grandma told me.

00:08:06.192 --> 00:08:09.262
So I don't know the whole story...

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.892
Did it become... better for you?

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.050
No.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.232
My mom got even more protective of him.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.240
I just got pushed aside even more.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.280
Honestly, my brother
didn't do anything wrong.

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.429
But I feel like he stole
my parents from me.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.066
So I just grew to resent him.

00:08:40.313 --> 00:08:41.839
Am I being childish?

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.290
No!

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.324
Not at all!

00:08:48.646 --> 00:08:50.519
You grew up well.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.549
And honestly, you're way
more handsome than your brother.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.680
You're smart, too.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.579
True.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.629
I'm the best, aren't I?

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.530
Wait, what?!

00:09:00.531 --> 00:09:01.808
Fine, fine.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:19.500
"Fan Service"
(Episode 2)

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.070
Um... hey!

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.030
Could I... get an autograph?

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.374
My name is Noh Jaeil.

00:09:40.966 --> 00:09:42.682
Thank you!

00:09:47.828 --> 00:09:50.161
(William)

00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:53.681
That prick...

00:09:56.126 --> 00:09:58.854
Want to know what his cards meant?

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:11.609
The first card means no romantic feelings.
It's more like friendship or family.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:20.210
The second is platonic love.
Deeper than friends, but not lovers.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:27.410
The last one says they'll be like family,
but never a couple.

00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:30.600
(What about that extra card?)

00:10:31.401 --> 00:10:37.950
That's the one chance I gave him.

00:10:38.774 --> 00:10:41.974
Whether he takes it... I don't know.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.710
(But why are you talking informally more and more...?)

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.170
30,000 won.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.080
(You said 20,000 earlier...)

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.500
30,000 won...
