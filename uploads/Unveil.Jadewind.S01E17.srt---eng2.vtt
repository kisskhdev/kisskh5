{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:45.025
Xia Shisan, Her Ladyship
and Mr. Xiao are here for you.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:54.345
Greetings, Your Ladyship and Mr. Xiao.

00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:01.545
We're here to ask
why you killed Huang Futong.

00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:05.345
Who is Huang Futong?

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.145
Why would I kill him?

00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:09.105
Under the pretext of fetching herbs,

00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:12.145
you parked your cart in the courtyard,
forcing Huang Futong to go around it.

00:02:12.225 --> 00:02:14.105
Then you pulled the rope

00:02:14.185 --> 00:02:16.545
and dropped the millstone
from the roof, crushing him.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:21.745
I don't understand
what you mean, Mr. Xiao. I--

00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:23.705
Then let's keep it simple.

00:02:24.225 --> 00:02:26.545
Why did you leave your cart
at the dispensary door?

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:27.785
Wouldn't it block the way?

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:29.865
The Imperial Food Service

00:02:29.945 --> 00:02:32.065
has needed a lot of herbs
for steaming lately.

00:02:32.145 --> 00:02:34.465
So I left the cart by the door

00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:36.545
to make it easier
to move the bags of herbs.

00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:38.905
The Medical Office supervisors
agreed to it.

00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:42.905
But since Your Ladyship said so,

00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:44.785
I won't do it again next time.

00:02:46.185 --> 00:02:49.465
The man you wanted dead is already gone.
Of course you don't need to do it again.

00:02:50.225 --> 00:02:53.185
I had no quarrel with Supervisor Huang.
I truly didn't kill him!

00:02:56.465 --> 00:02:57.465
Where are you from?

00:02:58.225 --> 00:02:59.065
I…

00:02:59.785 --> 00:03:00.705
I'm…

00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:05.385
from Mengzhou,
not far from the Eastern Capital.

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:08.585
Are you close to Pei Yu
at the Medical Office?

00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:15.225
I've only exchanged a few words
with the Apprentice Pharmacists.

00:03:15.905 --> 00:03:17.545
I don't know any of the supervisors.

00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:26.265
I didn't see anything suspicious, either.

00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:28.505
If I knew anything,

00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:31.025
I'd tell you without hesitation.

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:48.545
{\an8}He kept calm the whole time
and never gave anything away.

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:50.065
That just makes him more suspicious.

00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:51.945
Did you notice
the meat on the cutting board?

00:03:52.025 --> 00:03:54.545
His knife work was sharp and strong.

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:56.465
The cuts were neat,
with no scraps left behind.

00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:59.305
The meat was trimmed perfectly.

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:01.625
Most staff in the Imperial Food Service,

00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:04.705
no matter how careful they are,
get water or grease stains

00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:07.065
on their sleeves, elbows,
or the front of their robes.

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:09.945
Yet for all that chopping and washing,

00:04:10.025 --> 00:04:12.305
his clothes were spotless,
and he was meticulous.

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:14.945
Xia Shisan is the prime suspect.

00:04:15.465 --> 00:04:18.025
But right now, there's no direct evidence.

00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:21.145
The Medical Office is hectic.
People come and go there all the time.

00:04:21.225 --> 00:04:23.945
No one paid attention to the roof.

00:04:24.025 --> 00:04:27.345
And he's probably gotten rid
of the hemp rope by now.

00:04:50.465 --> 00:04:51.625
What's wrong?

00:04:51.705 --> 00:04:52.545
Look.

00:04:57.585 --> 00:04:58.425
How…?

00:05:09.985 --> 00:05:12.425
Why would someone cut open a dead body?

00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:29.305
That's Technician Pei's table.

00:05:36.585 --> 00:05:38.145
Weren't there guards outside the mortuary?

00:05:38.225 --> 00:05:39.705
It's tucked away
in the most secluded corner

00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:41.185
of the Palace Servants' Quarters.

00:05:41.265 --> 00:05:42.625
Hardly anyone ever comes here.

00:05:42.705 --> 00:05:44.945
Besides, it's just corpses inside.

00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:47.785
So, no one knows what happened here.

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:54.305
The fallen leaves all around
make the footprints indistinguishable.

00:05:55.785 --> 00:05:57.145
The incision is smooth.

00:05:57.225 --> 00:05:58.345
It was made with a knife.

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:00.945
All the organs are intact,
so it wasn't wild animals' doing.

00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:03.785
Then it had to be a person.

00:06:04.305 --> 00:06:05.345
Mutilating a corpse is a serious crime.

00:06:05.425 --> 00:06:06.505
Why would someone do it?

00:06:07.105 --> 00:06:08.385
Maybe out of anger.

00:06:08.465 --> 00:06:10.545
Maybe to frighten people.

00:06:11.345 --> 00:06:12.705
Post extra guards.

00:06:12.785 --> 00:06:14.305
Move the body out and burn it
as soon as possible.

00:06:14.385 --> 00:06:15.825
Don't leave it here too long.

00:06:15.905 --> 00:06:16.825
Understood.

00:06:26.945 --> 00:06:27.785
Your Ladyship,

00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:29.665
are you still awake?

00:06:29.745 --> 00:06:31.065
I've made a new discovery.

00:06:38.745 --> 00:06:40.185
What have you found, Mr. Xiao?

00:06:40.265 --> 00:06:42.345
Are you troubled
by Technician Pei's situation?

00:06:44.025 --> 00:06:45.625
Technician Pei is honest and sincere.

00:06:46.145 --> 00:06:48.305
She hasn't lied in any
of her statements so far.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.105
But I still can't rule
her out as a suspect.

00:06:50.185 --> 00:06:52.345
She is straightforward

00:06:52.425 --> 00:06:54.785
and devoted to medicine and healing.

00:06:54.865 --> 00:06:56.985
You feel a kinship with her,

00:06:57.065 --> 00:06:58.705
so I know you don't want to doubt her.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.385
Why did you ask me to come out here?

00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:04.865
Do you have evidence she's innocent?

00:07:05.465 --> 00:07:06.305
Look up, Your Ladyship.

00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:12.065
This is a Moon-Venus conjunction.

00:07:16.665 --> 00:07:19.585
Are you about to tell me it's a good omen?

00:07:22.185 --> 00:07:23.905
Your Ladyship, you really
aren't the romantic type.

00:07:26.265 --> 00:07:29.625
No, I'm not.
What's your take on this, Mr. Xiao?

00:07:31.105 --> 00:07:34.225
A Moon-Venus conjunction is a rare sight.

00:07:34.305 --> 00:07:36.585
You may not believe in omens,

00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:39.345
but it's still a stroke of luck
to see this tonight.

00:07:41.185 --> 00:07:43.105
So you really came to cheer me up.

00:07:44.385 --> 00:07:46.265
I'm not here to cheer you up.

00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:48.465
You'll make your own judgments, as always.

00:07:48.545 --> 00:07:52.185
But this is a rare and beautiful sight.

00:07:52.265 --> 00:07:55.665
I just hope it lifts
your spirits a little.

00:08:00.265 --> 00:08:03.185
And what does this conjunction
mean, exactly?

00:08:03.265 --> 00:08:06.505
It stands for harmony, peace,

00:08:08.545 --> 00:08:09.665
and good things to come.

00:08:14.705 --> 00:08:16.265
So in the end, I was right.

00:08:17.345 --> 00:08:19.745
If you don't believe it,
why did you ask me?

00:08:22.305 --> 00:08:24.065
Just for tonight, I'll believe it.

00:08:28.665 --> 00:08:32.105
Still, in a sky this vast,
with only one star as company,

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:34.185
the moon must still feel lonely.

00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:38.545
How can it be lonely

00:08:39.425 --> 00:08:40.664
when it has company?

00:08:45.345 --> 00:08:46.225
True.

00:08:46.785 --> 00:08:49.025
Most nights, the sky is full of stars,

00:08:50.265 --> 00:08:52.265
but now, with such a rare moment of quiet,

00:08:52.785 --> 00:08:54.985
here we are intruding on their peace.

00:08:55.065 --> 00:08:57.465
"Don't let a beautiful sight go to waste."

00:08:57.545 --> 00:08:59.545
We're not disturbing their peace.

00:08:59.625 --> 00:09:01.545
We're sharing in it.

00:09:19.305 --> 00:09:20.905
Your Ladyship, I checked.

00:09:20.985 --> 00:09:23.505
Xia Shisan may seem humble and obedient,

00:09:23.585 --> 00:09:25.425
but he's always a bit distant.

00:09:25.505 --> 00:09:27.465
Nobody
at the Food Service is close to him.

00:09:27.545 --> 00:09:29.665
One thing stood out.

00:09:29.745 --> 00:09:31.105
He claims he's from Mengzhou,

00:09:31.185 --> 00:09:34.665
but one time, he let slip
he was actually from Wanzhou.

00:09:35.265 --> 00:09:37.265
And while he looks mild and bookish,

00:09:37.345 --> 00:09:40.185
everyone says he's incredibly strong

00:09:40.265 --> 00:09:41.945
and that he's skilled at chopping bones
and trimming meat.

00:09:42.025 --> 00:09:43.305
Boss,

00:09:43.385 --> 00:09:45.545
should I send a letter to Prosecutor Gu
and have him investigate in Wanzhou?

00:09:47.185 --> 00:09:50.145
Yes, ask him to make a trip to Wanzhou.

00:09:50.665 --> 00:09:53.145
Besides Xia Shisan, look into Pei Yu too.

00:09:53.825 --> 00:09:55.305
Pei Yu is from Wanzhou too?

00:09:55.385 --> 00:09:58.545
BENEVOLENCE HALL

00:10:04.505 --> 00:10:05.585
Pei Yu?

00:10:07.785 --> 00:10:10.625
That's the student I'm proudest of!

00:10:11.225 --> 00:10:14.345
I heard Pei Yu was brought to the palace
by Imperial Physician Song?

00:10:14.945 --> 00:10:15.785
Yes.

00:10:17.545 --> 00:10:20.665
Physician Song was looking
for medical talent among the common folk.

00:10:21.185 --> 00:10:23.065
That child impressed him
with a single prescription

00:10:23.145 --> 00:10:25.745
and was chosen to enter the palace.

00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:27.785
The pride of our hall indeed!

00:10:27.865 --> 00:10:30.385
Technician Pei is also highly regarded
at the Imperial Medical Office.

00:10:31.105 --> 00:10:33.025
That child was exceptionally gifted

00:10:33.785 --> 00:10:35.705
and bold with remedies,

00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:38.465
even trying the medicines
first-hand to test their effects.

00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:41.465
Right.

00:10:41.985 --> 00:10:45.385
We even had a portrait of him painted.

00:10:45.465 --> 00:10:46.825
There it is.

00:10:47.545 --> 00:10:49.105
Because of him,

00:10:49.185 --> 00:10:53.625
physicians from all over
came to recruit apprentices here,

00:10:54.265 --> 00:10:58.665
and we received donations
from famed scholars and wealthy families

00:10:58.745 --> 00:11:00.865
to help us train orphans.

00:11:02.185 --> 00:11:03.625
When it comes to charitable deeds,

00:11:04.225 --> 00:11:06.225
his are truly peerless.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.345
That… That's Pei Yu?

00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:11.065
Yes.

00:11:11.825 --> 00:11:13.705
But that's clearly a boy.

00:11:15.225 --> 00:11:16.265
Of course.

00:11:17.105 --> 00:11:19.305
Benevolence Hall
doesn't accept female students.

00:11:24.185 --> 00:11:27.225
Was there ever a girl around Pei Yu's age
that he was close to?

00:11:30.785 --> 00:11:32.665
There was, actually.

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:34.985
Pei Yu,

00:11:35.505 --> 00:11:39.065
you know we don't take girls here.

00:11:39.825 --> 00:11:41.225
But she's all alone.

00:11:41.305 --> 00:11:43.345
She has no parents and no home.

00:11:43.425 --> 00:11:44.705
Learning medicine is about saving lives.

00:11:44.785 --> 00:11:46.505
What does it matter
if it's a girl or a boy?

00:11:48.345 --> 00:11:49.465
Please let her stay, Headmaster.

00:11:51.665 --> 00:11:53.265
All our students are boys.

00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:57.425
It's really not suitable
for a girl to stay here.

00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:02.625
Let me find you something else
to wear first.

00:12:16.665 --> 00:12:17.745
Where did she go?

00:12:21.145 --> 00:12:22.545
Come here.

00:12:24.105 --> 00:12:25.705
Make tea with this and drink it.
Your cough will go away.

00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:37.745
Well, then.

00:12:38.345 --> 00:12:40.705
Since Pei Yu insists, you may stay.

00:12:41.865 --> 00:12:45.425
Pei Yu, find her a room so she can change.

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:47.145
Yes.

00:12:48.625 --> 00:12:49.745
Come with me.

00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:22.825
- Monster!
- Monster!

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:24.025
- Stay away from us!
- Monster!

00:13:24.105 --> 00:13:26.585
- You are terrible!
- Monster!

00:13:26.665 --> 00:13:28.185
- Quiet, everyone!
- You are a monster!

00:13:28.265 --> 00:13:30.385
- What's going on?
- Look!

00:13:32.065 --> 00:13:33.425
{\an8}GOVERNING VESSEL, THE BLADDER MERIDIAN

00:13:41.505 --> 00:13:44.705
She did that at such a young age?

00:13:44.785 --> 00:13:45.945
Yes.

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:49.905
If there had been any other way,
I would have kept her.

00:13:50.505 --> 00:13:52.825
After all, it's hard for a girl
to survive on her own.

00:13:53.345 --> 00:13:56.145
But her behavior was too extreme.

00:13:56.225 --> 00:13:58.345
She rarely spoke,

00:13:58.945 --> 00:14:01.265
but she often frightened the other kids.

00:14:01.785 --> 00:14:03.945
I tried to discipline her,
but she wouldn't listen.

00:14:04.025 --> 00:14:05.985
But once you sent her away,

00:14:06.505 --> 00:14:08.305
she'd probably have
no chance of surviving.

00:14:09.025 --> 00:14:11.385
I didn't drive her out.

00:14:11.465 --> 00:14:13.545
She left on her own.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:16.305
She went up into the back mountain

00:14:17.185 --> 00:14:20.785
and wouldn't talk to anyone except Pei Yu.

00:14:20.865 --> 00:14:23.905
Pei Yu kept secretly looking after her

00:14:24.545 --> 00:14:28.585
until the year when Physician Song,
then an aide to the Imperial Physician,

00:14:29.105 --> 00:14:32.185
chose him to be his apprentice.

00:14:32.265 --> 00:14:34.865
This is the picrorhiza rhizome.

00:14:34.945 --> 00:14:35.785
Picrorhiza rhizome.

00:14:37.305 --> 00:14:38.225
It…

00:14:39.025 --> 00:14:39.865
Here, Headmaster.

00:14:48.145 --> 00:14:49.585
You went to see that girl again?

00:14:52.065 --> 00:14:54.985
Why do you care so much about a monster?

00:14:56.745 --> 00:14:59.425
Su, go play outside for a bit.

00:15:05.265 --> 00:15:07.865
Take some things from the hall

00:15:08.385 --> 00:15:10.465
and help her with food and clothing.

00:15:11.665 --> 00:15:12.705
Thank you, Headmaster.

00:15:13.465 --> 00:15:14.545
Pei Yu,

00:15:14.625 --> 00:15:17.425
Physician Song has decided
to take you to the palace.

00:15:17.505 --> 00:15:19.265
Pack your things soon.

00:15:24.265 --> 00:15:27.545
Are you reluctant to leave here,

00:15:27.625 --> 00:15:29.705
or are you worried about that girl?

00:15:31.345 --> 00:15:32.265
I want to go to the palace

00:15:32.785 --> 00:15:34.945
to learn more about medicine
and save more people.

00:15:36.265 --> 00:15:37.465
So after that,

00:15:38.385 --> 00:15:40.065
he went to the palace with Physician Song?

00:15:40.585 --> 00:15:41.505
What happened to the girl?

00:15:42.145 --> 00:15:44.145
After he left,

00:15:44.225 --> 00:15:46.545
we never saw her again.

00:15:47.345 --> 00:15:50.145
I led people up the mountain
to look for her.

00:15:50.225 --> 00:15:52.265
We searched for days but found no trace.

00:15:52.345 --> 00:15:56.505
All we found were a few scraps of cloth
and some bones.

00:15:57.185 --> 00:16:01.985
She probably got eaten by wolves.

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:08.265
Did you stay in touch
with Pei Yu after he left?

00:16:18.025 --> 00:16:23.185
Only recently
did he start sending letters.

00:16:23.985 --> 00:16:24.825
He said…

00:16:24.905 --> 00:16:25.945
TO THE HEADMASTER OF BENEVOLENCE HALL

00:16:26.025 --> 00:16:27.945
…that when he first got
to the Western Capital, he was overwhelmed

00:16:28.025 --> 00:16:29.545
with studies and had no time to write.

00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:33.425
Now that he's settled in
at the Imperial Medical Office,

00:16:33.505 --> 00:16:34.625
he finally found time to write us letters.

00:16:36.105 --> 00:16:38.585
Are all these in Pei Yu's handwriting?

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:39.665
Yes.

00:16:40.345 --> 00:16:41.945
I taught him to write as a child.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:43.665
I'd know his writing anywhere.

00:16:51.025 --> 00:16:51.985
When did this happen?

00:16:52.065 --> 00:16:53.545
Last night. It was the same as before.

00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:55.665
The bodies were badly mutilated,
and this time, there were even more.

00:16:58.025 --> 00:16:59.185
How were you guarding the place?

00:16:59.265 --> 00:17:00.345
Forgive us, Your Ladyship.

00:17:00.425 --> 00:17:03.025
We've stood guard for days without rest.

00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:05.224
There was no one there for just a moment
during the shift change,

00:17:05.305 --> 00:17:07.265
and that's when it happened.

00:17:28.865 --> 00:17:31.705
I've only exchanged a few words
with the Apprentice Pharmacists.

00:17:31.785 --> 00:17:33.425
I don't know any of the supervisors.

00:17:55.305 --> 00:17:56.185
Your Ladyship.

00:17:57.345 --> 00:18:00.345
The epidemic isn't over yet.
You shouldn't come here.

00:18:01.985 --> 00:18:03.545
I came across some medical texts

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:06.305
and thought you might find them useful,
so I waited here for you.

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:09.305
If Your Ladyship has questions, just ask.
There's no need to stand on ceremony.

00:18:09.905 --> 00:18:10.865
Let's talk inside.

00:18:15.825 --> 00:18:18.945
Have you slept at all
over the past few days?

00:18:20.865 --> 00:18:23.785
With the epidemic ongoing,
now isn't the time to rest.

00:18:25.025 --> 00:18:28.225
If you stay here all the time,
you could end up falling ill yourself.

00:18:28.985 --> 00:18:30.905
Honestly, I'd rather get sick.

00:18:31.425 --> 00:18:34.345
Knowing how the patients feel
helps me treat them better.

00:18:35.945 --> 00:18:38.065
But you can't just shoulder
everything alone.

00:18:38.145 --> 00:18:39.745
No matter what you think
of the others at the Medical Office,

00:18:39.825 --> 00:18:40.745
they can still be of help.

00:18:46.145 --> 00:18:47.265
You once said,

00:18:47.345 --> 00:18:50.425
"There's no knowing
what others truly think."

00:18:51.025 --> 00:18:52.945
Most people wear a mask.

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:56.425
No one can be completely open and honest.

00:18:58.225 --> 00:19:00.825
What is Your Ladyship trying to say?
I'm not sure I understand.

00:19:01.425 --> 00:19:03.305
To be sure someone has nothing to hide,

00:19:03.385 --> 00:19:05.185
you might have to cut them open and see

00:19:05.785 --> 00:19:07.465
what their heart is truly like.

00:19:08.345 --> 00:19:09.705
That's not something I'd ever do.

00:19:11.625 --> 00:19:13.305
But I am curious.

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:16.825
What's really beneath this human shell?

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:18.905
Technician Pei,

00:19:18.985 --> 00:19:21.625
as a healer, aren't you curious as well?

00:19:23.345 --> 00:19:26.465
My job is to heal, not to kill.

00:19:31.105 --> 00:19:33.665
Have you heard
about the corpses being cut open?

00:19:34.985 --> 00:19:36.185
Has it happened again?

00:19:43.905 --> 00:19:45.825
The bodies here were all infected.

00:19:45.905 --> 00:19:47.825
Your Ladyship only just recovered.

00:19:47.905 --> 00:19:49.225
You should be careful.

00:19:49.905 --> 00:19:52.265
Remember to burn
your outer clothes when you get home.

00:19:56.545 --> 00:19:58.145
I need to check on the palace maids.

00:19:58.225 --> 00:19:59.825
I won't keep you here.

00:20:00.345 --> 00:20:01.625
Please head back and rest, Your Ladyship.

00:20:02.745 --> 00:20:03.745
Thank you.

00:20:12.985 --> 00:20:14.345
She's put up her guard against you.

00:20:16.105 --> 00:20:17.225
I'm not sure.

00:20:18.185 --> 00:20:20.465
She seemed more distant,

00:20:20.985 --> 00:20:22.745
but maybe that was
more like her true self.

00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:26.865
Maybe she's never liked socializing
and has always been cold by nature.

00:20:31.945 --> 00:20:32.985
Mr. Gu's letter.

00:20:33.505 --> 00:20:35.865
TO MR.XIAO, FROM LINGZHOU

00:20:37.785 --> 00:20:39.985
A BOY, NOT A GIRL

00:20:41.505 --> 00:20:43.905
Pei Yu from Benevolence Hall was a boy?

00:20:44.985 --> 00:20:46.545
And the handwriting
in Pei Yu's recent letters

00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:47.745
matches that boy's exactly.

00:20:47.825 --> 00:20:50.625
Even palace incidents
that actually happened were written.

00:20:52.785 --> 00:20:54.305
LOOKED AFTER A GIRL HIS OWN AGE

00:20:54.385 --> 00:20:56.825
So this Pei Yu is also in the palace.

00:20:57.385 --> 00:20:59.345
Then who is the Technician Pei we know?

00:21:03.945 --> 00:21:06.505
Pei Yu's palace entry record
lists her as female.

00:21:07.185 --> 00:21:08.025
Pei Yu, originally a boy,

00:21:08.705 --> 00:21:10.905
turned into a girl after entering
the palace with Song Huaiyou?

00:21:16.065 --> 00:21:17.665
Why didn't Xia Shisan come
to fetch the medicine today?

00:21:17.745 --> 00:21:19.865
He fell ill yesterday and was sent
to the Palace Servants' Quarters.

00:21:31.265 --> 00:21:33.345
This is Xia Shisan's bed.

00:21:36.265 --> 00:21:37.585
ESSENTIAL PRESCRIPTIONS FOR EMERGENCIES

00:21:39.505 --> 00:21:40.985
Is this what he reads?

00:21:41.065 --> 00:21:42.785
Yes, he likes these kinds of books.

00:21:42.865 --> 00:21:45.345
He even talks like a scholar.

00:21:45.945 --> 00:21:47.465
- He knows medicine?
- He does.

00:21:47.545 --> 00:21:50.145
For any small injuries or illnesses,
we never need to go to anyone else.

00:21:50.225 --> 00:21:51.345
He can handle them.

00:21:51.425 --> 00:21:54.225
So he's always the one to fetch herbs
from the Medical Office.

00:21:54.305 --> 00:21:55.505
Your Ladyship.

00:21:58.865 --> 00:22:00.585
LUNG DISORDER WITH COLD AND HEAT SYMPTOMS
SEVERE LASSITUDE AND HEMOPTYSIS

00:22:20.865 --> 00:22:24.385
The blade matches the wounds
on the bodies in the mortuary.

00:22:36.345 --> 00:22:39.945
Is he the real Pei Yu
and the one dissecting the corpses?

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:41.225
All those animals at Benevolence Hall

00:22:41.305 --> 00:22:42.465
and the headless rats
found by Huang Futong

00:22:42.545 --> 00:22:43.625
were probably his doing too.

00:22:44.425 --> 00:22:47.065
He knows medicine, yet became a eunuch.

00:22:47.145 --> 00:22:50.025
The Pei Yu in the Medical Office now
must have switched identities

00:22:50.105 --> 00:22:51.025
with him somehow.

00:22:51.625 --> 00:22:53.345
The sick are sent to Pei Yu.

00:22:53.425 --> 00:22:54.265
Pei Yu's in danger!

00:23:00.345 --> 00:23:02.225
Xia Shisan hasn't been sent here.

00:23:04.625 --> 00:23:05.945
- They've found Xia Shisan.
- Where?

00:23:23.825 --> 00:23:27.265
It's her. She's the one dissecting bodies!

00:23:39.945 --> 00:23:41.185
You're not Pei Yu.

00:23:41.265 --> 00:23:42.385
He was.

00:23:42.465 --> 00:23:43.545
He contracted the epidemic.

00:23:43.625 --> 00:23:45.225
Without treatment,
he wouldn't have lasted long anyway.

00:23:45.305 --> 00:23:47.625
- Why go this far?
- Out.

00:23:48.425 --> 00:23:49.545
All of you, out!

00:24:00.585 --> 00:24:02.305
Why aren't we arresting her?
She killed him.

00:24:03.625 --> 00:24:05.705
There's still no proof she's the murderer.

00:24:05.785 --> 00:24:07.825
Xia Shisan can't have
cut himself open, can he?

00:24:09.065 --> 00:24:11.185
Whether she's the killer or not,
she won't get away.

00:24:12.825 --> 00:24:14.065
What if she kills herself
to avoid punishment?

00:24:15.865 --> 00:24:16.985
I won't give her the chance.

00:24:17.905 --> 00:24:18.745
TO BE TAKEN FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE DAYS

00:24:44.465 --> 00:24:46.105
Get this to the Medical Office.

00:24:47.265 --> 00:24:48.225
Hurry.

00:24:49.265 --> 00:24:50.185
Mr. Xiao.

00:25:13.105 --> 00:25:14.745
Your Ladyship, she's fine now.

00:25:25.745 --> 00:25:28.145
Did you give the formula
to the Medical Office?

00:25:33.945 --> 00:25:35.305
You were right.

00:25:36.345 --> 00:25:37.265
I'm not Pei Yu.

00:25:38.345 --> 00:25:39.985
The one who died was,

00:25:40.065 --> 00:25:41.945
and I killed him.

00:25:42.025 --> 00:25:43.585
Who are you?

00:25:46.025 --> 00:25:47.065
My name is Ying.

00:25:47.585 --> 00:25:50.345
I'm a criminal,
a fraud who stole someone's life.

00:25:51.425 --> 00:25:52.745
It wasn't just Xia Shisan.

00:25:53.345 --> 00:25:55.865
Song Huaiyou, Huang Futong,

00:25:56.425 --> 00:25:59.625
and all those bodies
cut open in the mortuary

00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:01.545
were all my doing.

00:26:02.145 --> 00:26:04.465
- Why?
- No reason.

00:26:04.985 --> 00:26:06.945
Didn't my colleagues tell you?

00:26:07.025 --> 00:26:08.545
That's just my nature.

00:26:10.025 --> 00:26:11.265
In that case,

00:26:12.145 --> 00:26:14.145
I don't see the need to waste time here.

00:26:14.825 --> 00:26:16.985
Your Ladyship,
please tell the Medical Office

00:26:17.065 --> 00:26:20.225
the formula must be adjusted
according to each patient's

00:26:20.305 --> 00:26:21.265
pulse and condition.

00:26:21.345 --> 00:26:22.345
Those with spleen and stomach deficiencies

00:26:22.425 --> 00:26:24.305
should first take remedies
to strengthen them

00:26:24.385 --> 00:26:25.305
before using this prescription.

00:26:26.145 --> 00:26:28.625
Make sure they don't delay.
The patients' lives come first.

00:26:38.065 --> 00:26:39.145
Watch her closely.

00:26:39.225 --> 00:26:41.545
Until we uncover the full truth,
don't let anything happen to her.

00:26:41.625 --> 00:26:43.025
We're still investigating?

00:26:43.545 --> 00:26:45.345
Didn't Ying already confess?

00:26:45.425 --> 00:26:47.025
In all my years
at the Palace Investigation Bureau,

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:48.945
I'd never seen anything so brutal.

00:26:50.545 --> 00:26:51.505
It doesn't add up.

00:26:52.105 --> 00:26:53.265
She hid it too well.

00:26:53.345 --> 00:26:54.865
If Prosecutor Gu hadn't
uncovered her deception,

00:26:54.945 --> 00:26:56.345
we might never have known that

00:26:56.425 --> 00:26:58.025
she stole Pei Yu's identity
to enter the palace.

00:26:58.105 --> 00:27:02.065
The real Pei Yu entered the palace
as Xia Shisan to get revenge

00:27:02.145 --> 00:27:04.185
but ended up killed and dissected by her.

00:27:04.265 --> 00:27:06.825
No normal person would do such a thing.

00:27:07.705 --> 00:27:10.145
Also, she's been torturing animals
since childhood.

00:27:10.665 --> 00:27:13.905
Your Ladyship, she's a monster
who kills for pleasure.

00:27:13.985 --> 00:27:15.305
If that's true,

00:27:15.385 --> 00:27:16.945
why did she wait all these years

00:27:17.025 --> 00:27:18.465
to act after Xia Shisan
entered the palace?

00:27:23.825 --> 00:27:25.545
The body is badly mutilated,

00:27:26.065 --> 00:27:28.945
but the cuts on the torso
were made after death.

00:27:29.025 --> 00:27:31.705
The real fatal wound is here.

00:27:33.225 --> 00:27:34.825
- Beside the Renying point.
- Right.

00:27:34.905 --> 00:27:36.545
Beside the Renying point
is the carotid artery.

00:27:37.145 --> 00:27:39.665
One cut here, and the blood will gush out.

00:27:39.745 --> 00:27:40.745
It's fatal.

00:27:41.305 --> 00:27:42.705
A clean, precise strike.

00:27:42.785 --> 00:27:45.345
Just what you'd expect
from a Medicine Technician.

00:27:46.185 --> 00:27:47.465
Are you certain
it was a Medicine Technician?

00:27:50.105 --> 00:27:52.625
The only people present
were the female Medicine Technician

00:27:52.705 --> 00:27:55.385
and this eunuch
from the Food Service, right?

00:27:56.065 --> 00:27:58.025
But this eunuch also studied medicine.

00:28:00.785 --> 00:28:02.385
The wound is on the left side of the neck,

00:28:02.985 --> 00:28:04.425
deeper on the left
and shallower on the right.

00:28:05.145 --> 00:28:06.465
So the knife entered
the left side of the neck

00:28:06.545 --> 00:28:07.945
from the right-hand side,

00:28:09.185 --> 00:28:11.265
not from the left as if facing the victim.

00:28:11.865 --> 00:28:13.625
And Pei Yu isn't left-handed.

00:28:14.225 --> 00:28:16.705
Could it have been suicide?

00:28:22.265 --> 00:28:23.185
This is also possible.

00:28:24.545 --> 00:28:26.265
But the victim was a man.

00:28:26.345 --> 00:28:27.785
The female technician

00:28:28.425 --> 00:28:30.145
would be unlikely
to inflict a wound like this on him.

00:28:32.145 --> 00:28:34.505
What if he was kneeling?

00:28:36.345 --> 00:28:40.585
But what could the female technician
have done to make the victim cooperate?

00:28:49.825 --> 00:28:51.625
The scene is too grisly.

00:28:51.705 --> 00:28:52.865
You shouldn't have come.

00:28:53.505 --> 00:28:56.945
I've seen so much of this with you.
It doesn't scare me anymore.

00:28:57.025 --> 00:28:58.505
Instead, I see these bloodstains

00:28:58.585 --> 00:29:00.625
as the last message
the victim left behind,

00:29:00.705 --> 00:29:01.585
waiting for us to interpret.

00:29:01.665 --> 00:29:02.785
Have you found anything?

00:29:02.865 --> 00:29:05.025
When we arrived,
Xia Shisan was already dead,

00:29:05.105 --> 00:29:07.385
so we don't know
how the murder actually happened.

00:29:07.465 --> 00:29:10.665
Most of the blood is concentrated here,
where the dissection was done.

00:29:10.745 --> 00:29:12.665
At first, I thought Pei Yu…

00:29:13.185 --> 00:29:14.785
no, Ying

00:29:14.865 --> 00:29:17.145
knocked Xia Shisan out

00:29:17.225 --> 00:29:19.545
and then did the dissection here.

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:22.545
But I've also found blood here.

00:29:22.625 --> 00:29:25.545
This must be where Xia Shisan was killed.

00:29:26.145 --> 00:29:28.505
Then Ying dragged him to the window
for better light.

00:29:29.105 --> 00:29:31.745
But I found no signs
of a body being dragged.

00:29:32.465 --> 00:29:34.305
No, that's not it.

00:29:38.865 --> 00:29:41.105
The fatal wound is near the Renying point.

00:29:41.185 --> 00:29:44.105
A stab here would cause
massive blood spray,

00:29:44.625 --> 00:29:47.745
but there's very little blood here,
and it's higher up.

00:29:47.825 --> 00:29:50.465
So Xia Shisan
must've been standing at the time.

00:29:51.145 --> 00:29:54.945
That means Ying
was in front of Xia Shisan,

00:29:55.025 --> 00:29:56.665
blocking some of the blood.

00:29:57.265 --> 00:29:59.465
Though Xia Shisan was ill before death,

00:29:59.545 --> 00:30:01.465
Ying was still no match for him.

00:30:01.985 --> 00:30:05.505
Neither of them showed signs
of a struggle,

00:30:05.585 --> 00:30:06.825
and Xia Shisan wasn't poisoned.

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:08.985
So Xia Shisan killed himself?

00:30:09.065 --> 00:30:10.465
It's the only possibility.

00:30:13.305 --> 00:30:14.265
{\an8}REGISTER OF MEDICAL VISITS

00:30:15.825 --> 00:30:18.505
I've checked the records
from the beginning of the year until now.

00:30:18.585 --> 00:30:21.065
The two of them
had dozens of interactions.

00:30:21.145 --> 00:30:23.025
If Ying's story is true,

00:30:23.105 --> 00:30:25.625
and Xia Shisan hated her
and wanted revenge,

00:30:25.705 --> 00:30:28.545
why, after three years in the palace,
did he not strike,

00:30:28.625 --> 00:30:29.505
but instead met with her frequently?

00:30:30.985 --> 00:30:34.545
But Xia Shisan also visited
Lady Su's palace at other times.

00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:36.785
Maybe their meetings
were just coincidence.

00:30:36.865 --> 00:30:39.745
I checked. Excluding the days
when he crossed paths with Ying,

00:30:39.825 --> 00:30:43.145
Xia Shisan visited Lady Su's palace
about once every ten days,

00:30:43.225 --> 00:30:45.225
which matches the frequency
of his visits to other palaces.

00:30:45.305 --> 00:30:48.345
So, aside from his normal shifts,

00:30:48.425 --> 00:30:49.545
Xia Shisan would swap duties

00:30:49.625 --> 00:30:52.185
with colleagues on the days
Ying delivered medicine to Lady Su?

00:30:55.025 --> 00:30:57.665
These are the prescriptions
Ying brought for Lady Su.

00:30:57.745 --> 00:31:00.505
There's no pattern to the days they met.

00:31:00.585 --> 00:31:03.625
How did Xia Shisan know in advance
when Ying would be delivering medicine?

00:31:03.705 --> 00:31:06.305
The Food Service doesn't usually know
the Medical Office's schedule.

00:31:06.385 --> 00:31:09.025
Moreover, most of the time,
we're responding to emergencies.

00:31:09.545 --> 00:31:11.025
It's unlikely
he could've known ahead of time.

00:31:12.905 --> 00:31:15.185
But those couldn't have been random days.

00:31:17.385 --> 00:31:19.225
PRESCRIPTIONS

00:31:21.345 --> 00:31:22.745
The medicine treats rheumatism.

00:31:23.425 --> 00:31:24.425
Rainy days.

00:31:25.505 --> 00:31:27.345
It was also raining on those days
of the last month.

00:31:27.425 --> 00:31:28.665
I remember it clearly.

00:31:28.745 --> 00:31:31.705
Around Pure Brightness and Grain Rain,
they crossed paths very often.

00:31:31.785 --> 00:31:33.025
For the other days they met,

00:31:33.105 --> 00:31:35.105
if we check the weather records
at the Astronomical Bureau,

00:31:35.185 --> 00:31:37.465
I'm sure those were rainy days too.

00:31:38.505 --> 00:31:40.505
So they never needed
to communicate secretly.

00:31:40.585 --> 00:31:42.065
The weather was their signal.

00:31:45.905 --> 00:31:47.025
Your Ladyship.

00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:48.185
What's this for?

00:31:48.705 --> 00:31:51.105
These are the clothes
stripped from Xia Shisan.

00:31:51.185 --> 00:31:53.785
The coroner said to burn them quickly
to prevent infection.

00:32:06.025 --> 00:32:09.505
If you won't say it, I'll say it for you.

00:32:10.665 --> 00:32:12.825
Pei Yu didn't enter
the palace for revenge.

00:32:12.905 --> 00:32:14.425
You two were still friends.

00:32:15.345 --> 00:32:16.385
My guess is,

00:32:16.465 --> 00:32:18.945
the reason you were able to join
the Medical Office with Song Huaiyou

00:32:19.545 --> 00:32:21.025
wasn't that you tricked Pei Yu,

00:32:21.545 --> 00:32:23.225
but that he willingly gave you his place.

00:32:24.265 --> 00:32:25.985
You were unruly as a child,

00:32:26.065 --> 00:32:28.105
and it was Pei Yu who looked after you
at Benevolence Hall.

00:32:28.705 --> 00:32:31.465
He was worried about you,
so he found a way into the palace too,

00:32:31.545 --> 00:32:33.705
even if it meant becoming a eunuch.

00:32:34.305 --> 00:32:37.665
He protected you, took revenge
on those who bullied you,

00:32:38.265 --> 00:32:40.505
and killed the people
who drove you into a corner.

00:32:40.585 --> 00:32:42.545
Since you couldn't stop him,

00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:44.545
you had to cover for him.

00:32:45.225 --> 00:32:46.065
I told you.

00:32:46.585 --> 00:32:48.185
I did all those things myself.

00:32:49.585 --> 00:32:50.945
The headmaster said

00:32:51.025 --> 00:32:54.145
you used to secretly dissect animals
at Benevolence Hall.

00:32:54.745 --> 00:32:57.905
That's just like how you
dissect corpses now.

00:32:57.985 --> 00:33:02.145
You only wanted to understand
how the illness affected the body.

00:33:02.225 --> 00:33:05.865
To help you develop cures,
Pei Yu even let himself get sick.

00:33:06.385 --> 00:33:08.145
That was his final act of help.

00:33:08.225 --> 00:33:09.785
That's nonsense.

00:33:11.065 --> 00:33:12.025
You have no proof.

00:33:12.105 --> 00:33:15.425
You pretended not to know each other,
but you were frequently meeting.

00:33:16.305 --> 00:33:18.065
The day of Rain Water three years ago

00:33:18.145 --> 00:33:21.825
was the first time you and Xia Shisan
met in the palace since he arrived.

00:33:37.905 --> 00:33:38.745
Technician Pei.

00:33:39.945 --> 00:33:43.625
Isn't it normal for palace staff
to cross paths?

00:33:44.225 --> 00:33:45.545
If that counts as evidence,

00:33:45.625 --> 00:33:48.425
I must have crossed paths
with Mr. Xiao as well.

00:33:49.425 --> 00:33:50.865
Does that make us close friends too?

00:33:53.265 --> 00:33:55.385
Then what about this?

00:33:59.425 --> 00:34:01.785
We found it among Xia Shisan's belongings.

00:34:44.344 --> 00:34:46.065
He wasn't my enemy.

00:34:48.105 --> 00:34:50.185
He was my best friend.

00:34:54.985 --> 00:34:56.385
I'm an orphan

00:34:57.465 --> 00:34:59.665
raised by a widowed old woman
in my village.

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:02.345
I didn't even have a name.

00:35:03.425 --> 00:35:06.785
Grandma and the villagers
just called me "wild girl."

00:35:08.065 --> 00:35:09.865
She gathered herbs for a living,

00:35:10.465 --> 00:35:14.025
and we'd trade them for food.

00:35:16.665 --> 00:35:18.465
She taught me how to identify herbs

00:35:18.545 --> 00:35:20.305
and some simple medical techniques.

00:35:23.585 --> 00:35:25.065
Be careful.

00:35:26.545 --> 00:35:29.865
A tiny herb could save a life.

00:35:30.545 --> 00:35:31.705
I found it fascinating

00:35:32.505 --> 00:35:34.345
and loved running into the mountains.

00:35:37.825 --> 00:35:38.905
Why are you sitting here?

00:35:39.625 --> 00:35:42.065
I fell and dislocated my arm.

00:35:42.785 --> 00:35:43.985
You should've said so.

00:35:54.705 --> 00:35:55.745
Easy…

00:35:55.825 --> 00:35:56.705
Easy…

00:35:57.625 --> 00:35:58.505
Done.

00:36:06.985 --> 00:36:08.065
You know bone-setting?

00:36:08.145 --> 00:36:09.065
Who taught you?

00:36:12.185 --> 00:36:13.625
You recognize black nightshade?

00:36:13.705 --> 00:36:15.145
Do you study medicine too?

00:36:28.945 --> 00:36:30.825
Stop following me. I don't know you.

00:36:30.905 --> 00:36:33.705
My name is Pei Yu. I study medicine
at Benevolence Hall down the mountain.

00:36:34.305 --> 00:36:35.185
It's just over there.

00:36:36.225 --> 00:36:38.025
What about you? Who taught you medicine?

00:36:38.625 --> 00:36:39.745
How come I've never seen you before?

00:36:41.185 --> 00:36:42.025
You really want to know?

00:36:51.185 --> 00:36:52.625
Do we have to go deeper?

00:36:52.705 --> 00:36:55.145
Yes. Didn't you want to know
who my teacher is?

00:36:57.985 --> 00:37:01.585
All the kids in the village knew
I liked to collect animal carcasses.

00:37:03.065 --> 00:37:04.545
They all said I was crazy.

00:37:05.585 --> 00:37:07.625
No one wanted to be friends with me.

00:37:18.785 --> 00:37:19.825
You're lying.

00:37:19.905 --> 00:37:22.545
These are just animal remains,
not a teacher.

00:37:23.785 --> 00:37:24.665
Aren't you scared?

00:37:25.425 --> 00:37:27.505
If you're not scared, neither am I.

00:37:28.545 --> 00:37:29.425
I'm not lying.

00:37:29.505 --> 00:37:32.225
Grandma only told me
that herbs can heal people.

00:37:32.305 --> 00:37:33.665
But I wanted to know why.

00:37:33.745 --> 00:37:36.145
I wanted to know what was really
inside the human body.

00:37:36.225 --> 00:37:38.705
These animals
are about the same as people.

00:37:38.785 --> 00:37:39.905
You're so smart.

00:37:39.985 --> 00:37:42.705
That way, you can learn
what bones and organs look like.

00:37:44.025 --> 00:37:44.985
That's not all.

00:37:45.065 --> 00:37:47.545
Sometimes, animals die of illness.

00:37:48.225 --> 00:37:50.665
When I cut them open,
I can see the focus of infection.

00:37:51.665 --> 00:37:55.625
But animals are still animals, not people.
There are still big differences.

00:37:56.905 --> 00:37:59.145
I thought Pei Yu
would be like everyone else.

00:38:00.625 --> 00:38:04.625
But instead of running away,

00:38:05.585 --> 00:38:07.265
he thought I was special.

00:38:09.905 --> 00:38:11.385
He taught me to read

00:38:11.905 --> 00:38:15.265
and shared his medical books
and notes from Benevolence Hall with me.

00:38:15.785 --> 00:38:17.025
Here.

00:38:17.105 --> 00:38:18.425
{\an8}To thank him,

00:38:19.185 --> 00:38:21.585
I gathered lots of herbs for him.

00:38:22.945 --> 00:38:24.265
CHAPTER 6: DIFFERENTIATION AND TREATMENT
OF TAIYANG DISEASE, PULSE AND SYMPTOMS

00:38:24.345 --> 00:38:25.545
Here.

00:38:30.745 --> 00:38:33.545
I quickly finished reading
every book he gave me.

00:38:33.625 --> 00:38:35.945
You should come study
at Benevolence Hall with me.

00:38:36.025 --> 00:38:36.865
Can I really go?

00:38:36.945 --> 00:38:38.025
Of course.

00:38:38.105 --> 00:38:40.225
Benevolence Hall takes in
orphans with no parents.

00:38:40.305 --> 00:38:41.145
The headmaster is very kind.

00:38:41.745 --> 00:38:44.385
Once you join, you'll become
the best student there.

00:38:46.745 --> 00:38:48.665
But you didn't get to stay
at Benevolence Hall.

00:38:50.825 --> 00:38:53.465
The headmaster kindly took me in,

00:38:54.345 --> 00:38:57.185
but by the rules,
girls weren't allowed to study medicine.

00:38:57.785 --> 00:38:59.265
I wasn't willing to give up,

00:38:59.345 --> 00:39:01.305
so I listened in from outside
the classroom window.

00:39:01.985 --> 00:39:04.705
But once I got caught
collecting animal corpses,

00:39:05.305 --> 00:39:07.625
the headmaster insisted I leave.

00:39:08.305 --> 00:39:10.345
But you and Pei Yu still stayed friends.

00:39:16.225 --> 00:39:18.225
By then, Grandma had already passed away,

00:39:19.665 --> 00:39:21.385
but Pei Yu stayed by my side.

00:39:22.145 --> 00:39:23.545
Just like before,

00:39:23.625 --> 00:39:25.665
he brought me books and notes

00:39:26.505 --> 00:39:27.865
so I could keep learning.

00:39:28.785 --> 00:39:29.905
Later,

00:39:30.865 --> 00:39:34.905
Song Huaiyou came to Benevolence Hall
and saw a prescription I wrote.

00:39:35.985 --> 00:39:38.145
Pei Yu wanted to tell him the truth,

00:39:39.545 --> 00:39:41.105
but I wouldn't let him.

00:39:42.065 --> 00:39:43.025
Why not?

00:39:44.145 --> 00:39:46.385
You could've used that chance
to prove yourself.

00:39:48.105 --> 00:39:50.505
Song Huaiyou wanted to take Pei Yu
to the Imperial Medical Office.

00:39:51.505 --> 00:39:52.825
I was happy for him.

00:39:53.665 --> 00:39:57.665
He had always helped me
and looked out for me.

00:40:00.465 --> 00:40:01.865
I wanted to repay his kindness.

00:40:01.945 --> 00:40:04.105
But in the end, he still gave
the opportunity to you.

00:40:13.465 --> 00:40:16.665
Wood sorrel in the Western Capital
won't be as healthy as the wild kind here.

00:40:19.265 --> 00:40:20.465
I don't want to leave.

00:40:20.545 --> 00:40:22.865
Why not? It's the Imperial Medical Office.

00:40:22.945 --> 00:40:25.145
You'll learn things
you could never learn here in a lifetime.

00:40:25.225 --> 00:40:26.985
I want you to go.

00:40:27.065 --> 00:40:27.905
You have talent.

00:40:28.505 --> 00:40:30.265
You should learn from the best teachers,

00:40:30.345 --> 00:40:32.825
make the best medicines,
and save many, many people.

00:40:32.905 --> 00:40:34.505
What are you talking about?

00:40:34.585 --> 00:40:35.545
I'm serious.

00:40:35.625 --> 00:40:36.825
I've got it all planned out.

00:40:36.905 --> 00:40:39.665
After we leave the city,
I'll go to the relay station.

00:40:39.745 --> 00:40:41.545
You'll change into my clothes there.

00:40:41.625 --> 00:40:43.465
While it's dark and he can't see clearly,

00:40:43.545 --> 00:40:45.425
- you'll go with him.
- I'm not doing it.

00:40:45.505 --> 00:40:47.905
It was your talent
that impressed Song Huaiyou.

00:40:48.865 --> 00:40:50.145
This opportunity belongs to you.

00:40:52.425 --> 00:40:54.905
Besides, I don't even like
studying medicine.

00:40:54.985 --> 00:40:57.465
Liar. You're only saying that
because you want me

00:40:57.545 --> 00:40:59.105
to take this opportunity, right?

00:40:59.185 --> 00:41:01.265
You've always worked hard.
The headmaster admires you too.

00:41:01.345 --> 00:41:04.065
I worked hard on my notes
so you could read them.

00:41:04.785 --> 00:41:07.345
If I got something wrong,
you'd learn it wrong too.

00:41:07.425 --> 00:41:08.545
Of course I had to be careful.

00:41:09.145 --> 00:41:10.825
What I really like is cooking.

00:41:10.905 --> 00:41:13.385
Didn't you always say the vegetable balls
I brought you were delicious?

00:41:13.465 --> 00:41:15.105
The headmaster said

00:41:15.185 --> 00:41:16.825
a boy shouldn't spend
so much time in the kitchen.

00:41:16.905 --> 00:41:18.625
But what you love doing shouldn't

00:41:18.705 --> 00:41:21.545
have anything to do with whether
you're a boy or a girl, right?

00:41:22.745 --> 00:41:23.585
So,

00:41:23.665 --> 00:41:25.945
if you love medicine, you should study it

00:41:26.025 --> 00:41:27.705
to treat people and save lives.

00:41:27.785 --> 00:41:29.705
And I'll do what I like too.

00:41:37.385 --> 00:41:38.305
But…

00:41:39.905 --> 00:41:40.865
Be careful!

00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:45.105
If you don't do as I say, I'll let go!

00:41:45.185 --> 00:41:45.985
Stop messing around!

00:41:46.065 --> 00:41:47.865
I've already written
a letter to Physician Song.

00:41:47.945 --> 00:41:49.905
If I die, when he reads it
tomorrow morning,

00:41:49.985 --> 00:41:51.185
he'll still take you away.

00:41:55.265 --> 00:41:56.545
Fine, I'll do it!

00:42:08.825 --> 00:42:10.665
I followed Pei Yu's plan

00:42:10.745 --> 00:42:12.625
and waited outside the city
at the relay station.

00:42:13.145 --> 00:42:14.025
Ying.

00:42:14.105 --> 00:42:16.625
But after leaving Benevolence Hall,

00:42:16.705 --> 00:42:19.185
Pei Yu just told Song Huaiyou everything

00:42:19.705 --> 00:42:22.065
and begged him to take me
to the Imperial Medical Office.

00:42:22.665 --> 00:42:25.745
Little girl, did you really
write that prescription?

00:42:25.825 --> 00:42:26.705
Yes.

00:42:26.785 --> 00:42:28.025
The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon,

00:42:28.105 --> 00:42:29.105
Treatise on Cold Damage
and Miscellaneous Diseases,

00:42:29.185 --> 00:42:30.065
and Shennong's Classic
of the Materia Medica.

00:42:30.145 --> 00:42:32.065
She's read them all
and knows them by heart.

00:42:34.265 --> 00:42:35.985
From that day on,

00:42:36.625 --> 00:42:39.465
I became Pei Yu.

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:44.545
Master taught me so much
and was especially strict with me.

00:42:45.225 --> 00:42:46.145
I knew

00:42:46.665 --> 00:42:48.505
he was just worried I'd get into trouble

00:42:48.585 --> 00:42:49.945
and be unable to stay
in the Medical Office.

00:42:50.825 --> 00:42:53.105
Some people were jealous
of how well Master treated me,

00:42:53.625 --> 00:42:55.465
so they claimed
I was his illegitimate child

00:42:56.505 --> 00:42:58.425
and spread all kinds of nasty rumors.

00:43:00.985 --> 00:43:02.505
If Pei Yu had been there,

00:43:03.945 --> 00:43:05.585
he never would've let them
treat me that way.

00:43:09.665 --> 00:43:11.905
I was supposed to return
to my hometown after two years,

00:43:12.665 --> 00:43:15.265
but Master still had so much to teach me

00:43:15.785 --> 00:43:17.585
and couldn't bear to see me go,

00:43:18.305 --> 00:43:19.545
so I stayed.

00:43:20.145 --> 00:43:23.585
Unexpectedly, Pei Yu became a eunuch

00:43:24.505 --> 00:43:26.345
and entered the palace just for me.

00:43:27.385 --> 00:43:31.785
Lady Su had rheumatism
and suffered terrible pain on rainy days.

00:43:32.625 --> 00:43:34.185
I was the one who brought her medicine.

00:43:34.705 --> 00:43:35.825
Because of that, Pei Yu and I

00:43:35.905 --> 00:43:38.385
could meet without making
any plans in advance.

00:43:39.225 --> 00:43:41.545
No one knew about our relationship.

00:43:42.065 --> 00:43:45.665
Not even Master knew
that Pei Yu had entered the palace.

00:43:46.505 --> 00:43:49.065
So you told Pei Yu about your hardships,

00:43:49.585 --> 00:43:51.545
and he used his position
in the Food Service

00:43:51.625 --> 00:43:52.465
to take revenge for you.

00:43:53.065 --> 00:43:53.985
They deserved it.

00:43:54.505 --> 00:43:56.105
They were less talented than I was,

00:43:56.185 --> 00:43:58.305
yet they belittled me, ordered me around,

00:43:58.905 --> 00:44:01.105
and even stole my prescriptions
for themselves.

00:44:01.865 --> 00:44:03.265
Pei Yu couldn't stand it,

00:44:03.345 --> 00:44:05.745
so he helped punish them
a little on my behalf.

00:44:06.265 --> 00:44:08.185
But he never did anything truly excessive.

00:44:08.785 --> 00:44:10.705
Then why did you punish Consort Li?

00:44:16.985 --> 00:44:18.865
In the notes you gave
Her Ladyship, you wrote

00:44:18.945 --> 00:44:20.985
that ginseng and veratrum
are antagonistic,

00:44:21.065 --> 00:44:23.025
but if the dosage is low,
it's hardly poisonous.

00:44:23.105 --> 00:44:25.385
If Consort Li had taken her usual dosage,

00:44:25.465 --> 00:44:27.145
she shouldn't have
shown signs of poisoning,

00:44:27.745 --> 00:44:30.785
at least not died from it within ten days.

00:44:31.545 --> 00:44:35.665
You made special pills for her
not just because she favored you,

00:44:36.425 --> 00:44:39.265
but because she discovered your secret
and threatened you.

00:44:42.825 --> 00:44:45.345
She once caught me meeting with Pei Yu

00:44:45.425 --> 00:44:47.225
and assumed we were having an affair.

00:44:47.745 --> 00:44:49.185
She threatened to report me.

00:44:50.145 --> 00:44:51.385
Were you having an affair?

00:44:52.985 --> 00:44:55.665
We were friends, nothing more.

00:44:55.745 --> 00:44:57.225
We'd never crossed any boundaries.

00:45:00.625 --> 00:45:02.665
I wanted to explain things to Consort Li,

00:45:03.585 --> 00:45:05.065
but Pei Yu was worried

00:45:05.145 --> 00:45:07.345
it would lead to our identity swap
being exposed

00:45:07.425 --> 00:45:08.985
and cause even more trouble.

00:45:09.825 --> 00:45:12.145
Since she only wanted beauty pills,

00:45:12.985 --> 00:45:14.145
I just made them for her.

00:45:15.025 --> 00:45:16.305
If that was all,

00:45:17.025 --> 00:45:18.585
you wouldn't have wanted to kill her.

00:45:21.105 --> 00:45:25.025
Consort Li must have wanted more,
and you refused.

00:45:26.465 --> 00:45:29.585
She was jealous that Consort Shu
had all the Emperor's favor,

00:45:30.105 --> 00:45:31.985
so she tried to make me
poison Consort Shu.

00:45:35.785 --> 00:45:37.105
I didn't want to hurt anyone,

00:45:37.625 --> 00:45:40.545
but Consort Li threatened
that if I didn't do it,

00:45:40.625 --> 00:45:43.145
she'd tell the Emperor
about Pei Yu and me.

00:45:44.545 --> 00:45:46.345
I felt increasingly worried.

00:45:47.145 --> 00:45:48.825
I wanted to tell Master,

00:45:49.585 --> 00:45:51.305
but Pei Yu said he'd handle it.

00:45:52.185 --> 00:45:53.825
Then, unexpectedly,

00:45:54.865 --> 00:45:56.385
Consort Li died a few days later.

00:46:01.505 --> 00:46:02.705
You did it, didn't you?

00:46:03.305 --> 00:46:05.065
Didn't we agree not to meet like this?

00:46:05.145 --> 00:46:06.985
It's too risky. You need to go back.

00:46:07.065 --> 00:46:08.105
Why did you kill her?

00:46:14.825 --> 00:46:15.785
As I said,

00:46:15.865 --> 00:46:17.105
all you need to do

00:46:17.185 --> 00:46:18.945
is focus on your work
at the Medical Office.

00:46:19.025 --> 00:46:20.865
You don't need to worry
about anything else.

00:46:21.425 --> 00:46:23.385
I'll clear away any obstacles for you,

00:46:23.465 --> 00:46:24.465
even if it means…

00:46:30.025 --> 00:46:31.985
Even if you're not
practicing medicine anymore,

00:46:32.065 --> 00:46:34.825
we both learned to save lives
from the headmaster.

00:46:34.905 --> 00:46:36.345
How could you just take a life like that?

00:46:39.625 --> 00:46:41.425
Why have you become like this?

00:46:46.905 --> 00:46:48.625
You're walking a very difficult path,

00:46:49.425 --> 00:46:53.345
and I was the one who put you on it.

00:46:54.345 --> 00:46:55.305
I can't just stand by.

00:47:00.705 --> 00:47:02.145
You're a female Medicine Technician,

00:47:03.505 --> 00:47:04.745
and I'm a eunuch.

00:47:06.105 --> 00:47:08.305
We can be trampled on
by anyone at any time.

00:47:08.905 --> 00:47:12.745
So no matter how hard it is,
you must climb to the top.

00:47:13.745 --> 00:47:14.705
Only then

00:47:15.785 --> 00:47:18.505
can you heal more people, save more lives,

00:47:19.585 --> 00:47:21.745
and not waste your talent
or your compassion.

00:47:23.025 --> 00:47:23.865
So,

00:47:24.785 --> 00:47:26.945
if I can clear any obstacles away for you,

00:47:30.025 --> 00:47:31.985
I will.
