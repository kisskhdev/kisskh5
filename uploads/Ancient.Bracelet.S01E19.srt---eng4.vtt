You're finally awake.

Ying Du.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.040
Ying Du.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.630
Ying Du.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.200
Let me take a look.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.870
You're still alive.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.790
Thank goodness.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.590
You scared me so much.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.200
I thought I'd never see you again.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.120
Oh, right.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.280
Your wound.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.240
Let me see.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.070
The wound has healed.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.000
That's such a relief.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.190
This is

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.120
not a dream, right?

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.190
I...

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.430
Since we've slept together,

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:51.053
you should take responsibility for me.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.430
I did all this

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.790
only to save you.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.680
No matter how it all began,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.510

let me be your husband

and protect you,

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.710

It's not like this is the first time.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.710
Just be quiet.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.920
From now on,

I was wrong.

I only feared

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.190
you might lose your life again.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.750
I'm even more afraid you'll be harmed.

I'm sorry.

I misunderstood you.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.750
You must never misunderstand me again.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.200
I won't.

Well, Your Majesty,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.430
sorry, I didn't mean to intrude.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.400
What happened to Ye Li?

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.240
She

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.910
committed suicide.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.540
Your Majesty,

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.710
I'll wait outside.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.360
You should rest here.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.520
I'll be back soon.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.270
Yan Che's mask and build

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.120
match that man in black.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.510
If it wasn't Ying Du,

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.870
could it be Yan Che?

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.870
But why would he do that?

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.800
Ying Du has repaired the Bracelet.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.360
It should now let me revisit the past

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.800
and uncover the truth.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.120
This is bad! The ruler has fainted!

Someone, hurry!

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.430
Help!

00:05:13.273 --> 00:05:14.390
(The barrier has vanished.)

00:05:14.653 --> 00:05:15.920
(Something happened to Ying Du.)

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.400
Ying Du,

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.040
you must hold on.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.250
Your Majesty,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.190
why would Princess Ye Li kill herself?

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.070
(This is)

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.630
(a distraction.)

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.470
Ye Li,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.270
you're alive.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.630
You lured Ying Du away

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.390
to capture me.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.240
No woman has ever entered his heart.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.480
Only you.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.680
You filled his mind

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.310
and sight,

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.310
yet you wounded him.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.190
This is what you deserve.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.630
This is the Flame Spring.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.600
It will seep into your skin

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.950
and hurt your organs,

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.510
making you wish you were dead.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.350
Ye Li.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.750
You keep talking like that;

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.950
don't you think it sounds insincere?

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.190
Everything I've done

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.830
was only for the ruler's sake.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.360
You are the Saintess,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.390
cursed by fate.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.240
He'll die because of you.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.080
Ye Li,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
if this comes from jealousy,

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.870
why not just kill me outright?

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.680
Why go through so much trouble
to set a trap?

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.000
You must have another reason.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.070
No wonder the ruler favors you.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.270
You

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.750
are simply too clever.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.040
What do you mean by that?

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.120
Yan Che is not one of the Wuyue tribe.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.000
He's been plotting against the ruler.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.160
He told me to capture you

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.830
to lure the ruler out.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.190
Only by killing him

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.480
can the ruler be safe.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.390
Why don't you do it?

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.000
You think I don't want to?

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.720
But his power is too strong.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.270
I couldn't harm him at all.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.560
Now, only you
can make him drop his guard.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.070
My wounds won't hold much longer.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.480
(To make Zhaoli offer
her heart's blood,)

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.920
(this is the only way left.)

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.360
He found us so soon.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.590
Zhaoli.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.880
Zhaoli!

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.560
I'm sorry; I came too late.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.480
I'm taking you home.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.390
Let go of her hand.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.950
I'll never let go of Zhaoli again.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.680
Then have a try.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.800
Let's see if you can leave here alive.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.830
Whenever he uses his power,

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.950
the Frostbite Curse worsens.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.920
He told me to capture you

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.070
to lure the ruler out.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:31.560
Ying Du,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.400
stop!

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.670
I'm not leaving with you.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.960
My rightful husband

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.270

Zhaoli,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.550
say that again.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.990
As I said,

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.670
I'm Che's wife.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.150
(I have to stall Yan Che.)

00:08:56.673 --> 00:08:57.960
(Only then will Ying Du be safe.)

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.680
Che,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.990
