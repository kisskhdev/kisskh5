00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:33.616
Hey, what on earth is Park Jeong-woo doing these days?

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.120
Jaeseop...

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.000
Jaeseop, I think I'm going crazy...

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.334
Is something wrong?

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:48.631
Hey, Jeong-woo.

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:49.466
Park Jeong-woo!

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:12.614
Are you awake?

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:17.827
Hyung, why are you here?

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:21.956
Because I'm the one who saved the kid who collapsed on the street.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.293
Do they call that a lifesaver?

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.630
Or do they call it fate?

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.597
Aren't you busy with work?

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.184
I am busy, that's why I'm doing this.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.544
Since you care so much,

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:12.340
why didn't you pick up the phone?

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:15.176
Ah...

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.554
Just because.

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:25.562
He's more of a romanticist than he looks.

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:29.774
Who?

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:33.695
Mr. Park Jeong-woo.

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:38.700
I heard he almost got a criminal record because of his first love?

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:48.251
Hey.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.087
I...

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:57.302
I even did an open run at the department store.

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.470
For what?

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:02.182
A proposal.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.059
You are a romanticist.

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.854
But you know what?

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:13.151
The real romanticist is our Jeong-woo.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.362
Why?

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:17.739
For his first love,

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.909
he's a guy who even went to a holding cell.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:25.163
Holding cell...?

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:30.043
Ah... our poor Jeong-woo.

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:35.506
When was that?

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:46.726
A few years ago?

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.620
What are you talking about?

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.545
His first love...

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:18.424
It seems they were bullied pretty badly by their ex.

00:04:19.717 --> 00:04:22.637
So he beat him up for them,

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:25.139
and ended up in the holding cell.

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:28.226
But the ending is obvious, isn't it?

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.107
Let's break up.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:43.032
They say he went to the army as soon as he settled.

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:50.206
But why didn't they contact him?

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:55.128
Must have forgotten.

00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:02.010
Or...

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:04.512
The timing...

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:10.393
Was completely off.

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:40.006
Seeing you sober up,

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:42.592
I guess I can go now.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.326
You shouldn't say that, Team Leader.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:09.869
Department Head Kim,

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.705
You clearly made a sexual harassment remark to Mr. Lee Han-gyul.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.207
Go ahead!

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.293
But if you act like there's no problem,

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:19.587
I really won't let this slide.

00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:37.605
Mr. Yuchan...

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:42.777
By any chance...

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.655
Lee Han-gyul's house,

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:49.492
do you know where it is?

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.122
Why?

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:59.836
I have something I want to say.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.287
Where are you?

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:36.998
I'm home.

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:41.711
I'm coming.

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.005
Right now?

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:46.048
Yeah.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:53.139
You know where my house is?

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:55.266
I know,

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:57.894
where you are.

00:07:58.603 --> 00:07:59.937
Now everything...
