{\an8}‪ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
‪ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:37.305
Your Ladyship,

00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:40.865
you're reviewing the case late at night?

00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:46.465
Can't we wait until tomorrow
to discuss it with His Majesty?

00:01:48.265 --> 00:01:49.105
Just thinking about Remonstrator Lu

00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:51.265
sleeping through the night
comfortably at home,

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:52.545
I feel uneasy all over.

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:54.625
So yes, sorry to trouble you both.

00:01:54.705 --> 00:01:56.705
After all, it's a case
His Majesty personally inquired about.

00:01:57.625 --> 00:01:59.265
Let's have Deputy Director Xiao
take the records.

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:02.665
Then let's begin.

00:02:06.385 --> 00:02:07.545
Remonstrator Lu, please repeat

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:09.465
what happened last night at Swallow House.

00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:17.545
I arrived at Swallow House
half past the You hour.

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:19.945
I was meeting with Liu Ying'er
to go over the score.

00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:22.185
It's this section.

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:25.345
Could you tell us again

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:27.265
how you communicated with Liu Ying'er?

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:31.545
That's improper.

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:33.305
Your Ladyship,

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:35.625
since you're handling the case this late,

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:37.425
why not focus on the key points

00:02:37.945 --> 00:02:39.985
and resolve it quickly?

00:02:42.265 --> 00:02:43.785
What's there to be shy about?

00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:46.385
It would also give us a chance to see

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:48.425
the talent
of the second-year graduate of Yongtai.

00:02:51.945 --> 00:02:53.185
Last night,

00:02:53.265 --> 00:02:55.745
Liu Ying'er played a new piece.

00:02:56.305 --> 00:02:58.065
I felt it lacked a bit of charm.

00:02:58.665 --> 00:03:00.865
So I composed some lyrics
for the new score.

00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:03.025
"Mist shrouds the silver boat,

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:06.465
moon halo on the branches,
my heart grows obsessed."

00:03:07.265 --> 00:03:08.425
Nice lyrics!

00:03:09.025 --> 00:03:10.305
Truly beautiful lyrics.

00:03:10.905 --> 00:03:12.545
But I'm quite lacking in talent.

00:03:13.065 --> 00:03:15.465
Could you explain
the meaning of these words?

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:18.425
It's just a few descriptive phrases
about the night sky.

00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:20.225
At that moment,
I glanced outside the window

00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:22.185
and saw the thick night mist
and the hazy moon halo.

00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:24.425
I casually wrote these two lines.

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:25.905
Nothing special, really.

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:28.505
You truly have an elegant taste.

00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:30.585
But how could such exquisite words

00:03:30.665 --> 00:03:32.745
make Liu Ying'er unhappy?

00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:38.705
I said the rhythm of the piece was off,
and it didn't match the lyrics.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:41.265
Liu Ying'er disagreed,
and we started arguing.

00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:44.345
At the second ke of Xu hour,
Liu Ying'er ran out in a huff.

00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:45.785
I got up to chase her,

00:03:45.865 --> 00:03:47.545
but accidentally fell down the stairs.

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:48.985
The people in Swallow House all saw it.

00:03:49.665 --> 00:03:51.585
I really don't know anything
about Xiuhong House,

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:52.825
and I certainly haven't been there.

00:03:52.905 --> 00:03:55.145
You two must have had quite an argument,

00:03:55.225 --> 00:03:57.185
which is why Liu Ying'er
ran out of the room.

00:03:57.265 --> 00:03:58.945
In your hurry,

00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:01.105
how did you know

00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:02.665
that it was exactly
the second ke of Xu hour?

00:04:03.465 --> 00:04:04.305
Yes.

00:04:04.905 --> 00:04:07.905
Why do you remember it so clearly?

00:04:08.545 --> 00:04:10.905
Because the attendant there

00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:12.825
was repeatedly announcing the time,

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:15.105
"On the third day of the fifth month,
at the second ke of the Xu hour,

00:04:15.185 --> 00:04:17.225
Mr. Lu claims
'Hundred Birds Return to Nest'!"

00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:19.384
That was the most expensive reward
at Swallow House.

00:04:19.465 --> 00:04:21.265
So your lyrics were written

00:04:21.345 --> 00:04:23.265
before the second ke of Xu hour?

00:04:24.705 --> 00:04:25.745
Correct.

00:04:26.425 --> 00:04:27.785
The moon halo

00:04:28.305 --> 00:04:30.745
was also seen
before the second ke of Xu hour?

00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:33.105
Your Ladyship,

00:04:33.185 --> 00:04:36.465
why are we going back
to those lyrics again?

00:04:37.545 --> 00:04:39.425
On matters of the heavens,

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:41.305
Deputy Director Xiao knows best.

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:42.865
Let's ask him.

00:04:49.665 --> 00:04:51.065
According to official records,

00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:52.945
the moon halo appeared
at the fourth ke of Xu hour last night

00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:54.185
and completely dissipated by the Hai hour.

00:04:54.265 --> 00:04:56.105
If Remonstrator Lu saw the moon halo,

00:04:56.185 --> 00:04:57.305
it must have been
at the fourth ke of Xu hour.

00:04:57.905 --> 00:04:59.465
After you wrote the lyrics, argued,

00:04:59.545 --> 00:05:00.945
then fell down the stairs,

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:02.305
that would've been
at least the sixth ke of Xu hour.

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:07.865
So, you're lying.

00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:10.545
No, I'm not!

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:11.945
Everyone, think about it.

00:05:12.025 --> 00:05:14.385
If it wasn't for that attendant
shouting out the second ke of Xu hour,

00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:15.945
how would I know the exact time?

00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:18.225
I arrived at Swallow House
half past the You hour

00:05:18.305 --> 00:05:19.665
to meet Liu Ying'er.

00:05:19.745 --> 00:05:21.105
And I really did see the moon halo.

00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:24.385
If someone is lying,
it should be the attendant.

00:05:24.465 --> 00:05:26.065
Why blame me for it?

00:05:26.145 --> 00:05:27.865
There was no water clock at Swallow House.

00:05:28.465 --> 00:05:30.385
The time was reported
by the nearby watchman.

00:05:30.985 --> 00:05:32.345
If he was in your pocket,

00:05:32.425 --> 00:05:34.105
- the hour was yours to name.
- You…

00:05:34.185 --> 00:05:35.745
With a few coins,

00:05:35.825 --> 00:05:38.465
you bought any time you pleased.

00:05:39.345 --> 00:05:40.905
Speaking nonsense!

00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:42.785
Am I speaking nonsense?

00:05:42.865 --> 00:05:44.585
Once the watchman arrives, we'll know.

00:05:45.585 --> 00:05:46.625
Don't rush.

00:05:46.705 --> 00:05:48.185
We've already caught him.

00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:49.105
He should be here soon.

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:52.265
Remonstrator Lu,

00:05:53.225 --> 00:05:55.985
Her Ladyship has seen you
at Xiuhong House.

00:05:56.065 --> 00:05:57.985
Can't you be wronged?

00:05:58.065 --> 00:06:00.905
Rather than trying to scheme your way out,

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:03.625
a honest confession serves you better!

00:06:04.425 --> 00:06:05.585
Alright.

00:06:09.385 --> 00:06:10.545
This case

00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:14.745
involves the inner palace.
It's a serious matter.

00:06:15.345 --> 00:06:17.385
The Court of Judicial Review will assist
the Palace Investigation Bureau

00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:19.065
in investigating it.

00:06:19.665 --> 00:06:21.265
As for Lu Zhenglian,

00:06:21.345 --> 00:06:23.865
once I report it tomorrow,

00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:26.425
His Majesty will decide.

00:06:27.025 --> 00:06:27.905
Understood.

00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:48.305
Prosecutor Gu has found Jiang Tingwei.

00:06:48.385 --> 00:06:49.825
We're short on manpower
and need reinforcements.

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:54.985
Chief Justice.

00:06:57.985 --> 00:06:59.705
I'll leave Remonstrator Lu to you.

00:07:00.905 --> 00:07:01.745
Understood.

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:28.105
If we do nothing,

00:07:28.185 --> 00:07:30.865
we'll have no way out.

00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:44.665
Everyone, be sharp.

00:07:44.745 --> 00:07:45.585
Strengthen the defenses.

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:46.905
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

00:07:50.505 --> 00:07:51.865
Someone's following us!

00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:52.785
Stay alert!

00:08:02.345 --> 00:08:03.425
Stop right there!

00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:07.745
Now's the time! Move!

00:09:09.665 --> 00:09:10.785
Go save them!

00:09:15.025 --> 00:09:15.865
Taozhi!

00:09:27.585 --> 00:09:28.425
Taozhi.

00:09:29.425 --> 00:09:30.665
It's me.

00:09:33.745 --> 00:09:35.065
Lingzhou…

00:09:38.505 --> 00:09:39.985
It's my fault.

00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:41.785
I came late.

00:09:45.825 --> 00:09:46.665
Capture them alive.

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:55.585
Everyone, step back!

00:10:03.025 --> 00:10:04.385
Take the alive ones back.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.225
Understood.

00:10:08.185 --> 00:10:09.025
Move!

00:10:09.625 --> 00:10:10.385
Get up!

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:32.705
- Taozhi!
- Taozhi!

00:10:32.785 --> 00:10:33.745
Taozhi!

00:10:33.825 --> 00:10:34.665
- Taozhi!
- Taozhi!

00:10:34.745 --> 00:10:35.545
- Taozhi!
- Taozhi!

00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:37.105
- Taozhi!
- Taozhi!

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:39.385
Taozhi!

00:10:39.465 --> 00:10:40.665
- Taozhi!
- Taozhi…

00:10:42.185 --> 00:10:43.105
Your Ladyship…

00:10:44.985 --> 00:10:45.825
Taozhi…

00:10:47.425 --> 00:10:48.265
Taozhi…

00:10:52.425 --> 00:10:53.625
- Taozhi…
- Taozhi…

00:10:54.345 --> 00:10:55.225
Taozhi…

00:11:08.545 --> 00:11:09.625
I'm here.

00:11:09.705 --> 00:11:10.705
I'm here.

00:11:11.705 --> 00:11:12.985
Don't cry…

00:11:14.865 --> 00:11:15.945
Let's go home…

00:11:17.665 --> 00:11:18.665
Alright.

00:11:19.585 --> 00:11:20.825
I will take you home.

00:11:22.305 --> 00:11:23.145
Let's go home.

00:11:23.705 --> 00:11:25.425
- I will take you home.
- Take me…

00:11:26.745 --> 00:11:27.665
Taozhi…

00:11:34.025 --> 00:11:35.025
Taozhi?

00:11:36.185 --> 00:11:37.065
Taozhi?

00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:38.465
- Taozhi!
- Taozhi!

00:11:38.545 --> 00:11:39.585
Taozhi!

00:11:39.665 --> 00:11:40.705
Taozhi!

00:11:40.785 --> 00:11:42.905
- Taozhi!
- Taozhi!

00:11:42.985 --> 00:11:44.305
Taozhi!

00:11:44.825 --> 00:11:46.225
- Taozhi!
- Taozhi!

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:47.425
Taozhi…

00:11:47.945 --> 00:11:48.825
Taozhi…

00:11:51.145 --> 00:11:52.305
Taozhi…

00:11:54.305 --> 00:11:55.985
Taozhi…

00:12:01.705 --> 00:12:02.785
Taozhi…

00:12:02.865 --> 00:12:03.865
GOODS HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED

00:12:03.945 --> 00:12:06.865
LI PEIYI FOUND THE "HUNDRED BIRDS
RETURN TO NEST" FROM SWALLOW HOUSE

00:12:10.225 --> 00:12:11.745
Li Peiyi found

00:12:11.825 --> 00:12:14.145
Swallow House's reward,
the "Hundred Birds Return to Nest."

00:12:16.265 --> 00:12:17.585
As expected.

00:12:19.545 --> 00:12:21.265
Lu Zhenglian can't escape now.

00:12:22.665 --> 00:12:24.185
Xiuhong House is no longer an option.

00:12:24.265 --> 00:12:25.745
We can't save Sun Zhiwang either.

00:12:27.185 --> 00:12:29.425
Lu Zhenglian is in the same boat as us.

00:12:29.505 --> 00:12:31.825
A few stern words
should make him hesitate.

00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:34.385
But Sun Zhiwang is a businessman.

00:12:34.905 --> 00:12:38.705
Who knows what conditions Li Peiyi
will offer him?

00:12:38.785 --> 00:12:40.785
He knows a lot.

00:12:42.185 --> 00:12:43.945
Go tell your master,

00:12:44.025 --> 00:12:46.345
whether Sun Zhiwang keeps quiet

00:12:46.425 --> 00:12:48.305
depends on his skill.

00:12:49.705 --> 00:12:50.545
Understood.

00:13:00.025 --> 00:13:03.145
They don't have anything on them
that can prove their identities.

00:13:04.065 --> 00:13:06.025
I checked those
unexploded fire thunder bombs.

00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:07.105
Nothing odd.

00:13:07.185 --> 00:13:08.465
They're probably death warriors.

00:13:09.945 --> 00:13:12.265
We got word of it and rushed here at once.

00:13:12.345 --> 00:13:14.385
But those men in black
arrived earlier than us.

00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:18.585
Sun Zhiwang has such big power?

00:13:19.545 --> 00:13:20.625
It couldn't have been him.

00:13:23.025 --> 00:13:24.905
XIUHONG HOUSE

00:13:24.985 --> 00:13:26.025
Seal!

00:13:28.385 --> 00:13:29.465
SEALED
BY THE LEFT GUARD COMMANDANT'S OFFICE

00:13:29.545 --> 00:13:30.385
SUN'S MANSION

00:13:39.305 --> 00:13:40.465
Don't move!

00:13:57.065 --> 00:13:58.745
Your Ladyship,

00:13:59.625 --> 00:14:02.545
I'm telling the truth.
I haven't hidden a single thing.

00:14:03.665 --> 00:14:05.465
Xiuhong House has always
been managed by Hu Da.

00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:06.505
I never interfere.

00:14:06.585 --> 00:14:09.065
He abused his position
to kidnap palace maids

00:14:09.145 --> 00:14:10.185
and set up a brothel.

00:14:10.265 --> 00:14:11.625
It's indeed a grave crime!

00:14:12.385 --> 00:14:14.185
Indulging Hu Da was my fault.

00:14:14.265 --> 00:14:15.705
I admit my guilt.

00:14:15.785 --> 00:14:16.625
But…

00:14:17.145 --> 00:14:19.625
as for the clients he found,
how he found them,

00:14:19.705 --> 00:14:22.585
I really don't know anything about it.

00:14:23.785 --> 00:14:26.065
Don't be so hasty
to burn your bridges, Mr. Sun.

00:14:26.585 --> 00:14:28.665
Think carefully before you speak.

00:14:29.385 --> 00:14:31.385
I… Even if you push me to death,

00:14:31.465 --> 00:14:32.985
I still know nothing about it!

00:14:35.065 --> 00:14:37.145
I… I…

00:14:38.025 --> 00:14:39.945
So you are holding back.

00:14:40.465 --> 00:14:42.425
Guards, take a good look.

00:14:42.505 --> 00:14:44.545
Remove anything that could injure him

00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:46.465
and cause an accidental death.

00:14:50.185 --> 00:14:52.225
Don't try to bite your tongue.

00:14:52.305 --> 00:14:53.265
It'll be hard to die that way.

00:14:53.345 --> 00:14:55.025
Even if you die, you'll go to hell.

00:14:55.105 --> 00:14:56.705
That's terrifying.

00:14:56.785 --> 00:14:58.785
Tonight, Mr. Xiao and I won't go anywhere.

00:14:58.865 --> 00:14:59.745
We'll just stay with you.

00:15:00.345 --> 00:15:03.065
Please… hear me out.

00:15:03.145 --> 00:15:05.065
You can't blame me for this!

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:20.385
You're still questioning him?

00:15:20.985 --> 00:15:21.865
This isn't your concern.

00:15:37.945 --> 00:15:38.985
I won!

00:15:42.265 --> 00:15:43.625
You mistook the pawn.

00:15:44.705 --> 00:15:46.985
It's clearly a black pawn.

00:15:47.785 --> 00:15:49.825
Your drawing is unclear.

00:15:49.905 --> 00:15:50.825
How can you blame me?

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:54.745
I've been losing all the time.

00:15:54.825 --> 00:15:55.665
This is no fun!

00:16:03.225 --> 00:16:04.425
Made up your mind?

00:16:17.945 --> 00:16:19.425
Lu Zhenglian won't speak.

00:16:19.505 --> 00:16:20.705
Sun Zhiwang won't dare speak.

00:16:20.785 --> 00:16:23.705
Looks like the clients at Xiuhong House
are either rich or noble.

00:16:23.785 --> 00:16:25.345
They can't afford to offend them.

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:29.465
Others, probably,
are like Lu Zhenglian, officials in court,

00:16:29.545 --> 00:16:30.945
which makes them so cautious.

00:16:31.025 --> 00:16:33.305
His Majesty has always disapproved
of officials meeting in secret.

00:16:33.385 --> 00:16:34.305
If that's the case,

00:16:34.905 --> 00:16:36.545
they've probably been
working together for a long time.

00:16:36.625 --> 00:16:37.585
It'll be even harder to get them to spill.

00:16:38.465 --> 00:16:39.305
No rush.

00:16:39.825 --> 00:16:41.065
We still need one last push.

00:17:17.944 --> 00:17:20.865
Li Peiyi, you're so devious!

00:17:20.944 --> 00:17:22.464
I haven't said anything!

00:17:22.545 --> 00:17:24.065
Stop shouting.

00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:26.665
Your room is at the very end.

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:28.424
No one can hear you.

00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:31.065
But they'll know Deputy Director Xiao
questioned you for an entire night,

00:17:31.145 --> 00:17:32.625
and paper was delivered several times.

00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:34.385
They'll also know,

00:17:34.465 --> 00:17:37.225
after you confessed,
I rewarded you greatly.

00:17:37.825 --> 00:17:39.025
The situation is set.

00:17:39.105 --> 00:17:41.185
You can stay silent

00:17:41.265 --> 00:17:44.025
or take this opportunity
to tell me everything you know.

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.625
I'll make sure you stay alive.

00:17:46.225 --> 00:17:48.425
- You…
- I'll give you two hours.

00:17:48.505 --> 00:17:49.505
Think it over.

00:17:52.665 --> 00:17:54.425
Watch him closely. He'll crack soon.

00:17:54.505 --> 00:17:55.585
Don't let anyone near him.

00:17:55.665 --> 00:17:57.225
- No one is allowed.
- Understood.

00:18:19.105 --> 00:18:20.185
Sun Zhiwang has confessed.

00:18:25.185 --> 00:18:28.265
He probably hasn't said anything, right?

00:18:29.305 --> 00:18:30.425
‪Is it?

00:18:33.025 --> 00:18:35.145
I thought you had some great ability,

00:18:35.825 --> 00:18:37.865
but in the end,
you're just an ignorant woman.

00:18:37.945 --> 00:18:39.465
If he really did spill,

00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:42.105
why waste time here with me?

00:18:43.465 --> 00:18:45.385
How is it wasting time?

00:18:46.345 --> 00:18:49.505
I just wanted to see your last expression.

00:18:51.865 --> 00:18:53.065
It's really interesting.

00:18:54.745 --> 00:18:57.465
Are you really going to blindly trust
Sun Zhiwang's one-sided story?

00:18:59.785 --> 00:19:01.745
Sun Zhiwang's attitude was sincere,

00:19:01.825 --> 00:19:03.585
and he spoke in great detail,

00:19:04.105 --> 00:19:05.985
far more convincingly than you.

00:19:07.185 --> 00:19:08.785
He's a businessman.

00:19:08.865 --> 00:19:10.585
Of course he'll spin the tale
to suit himself.

00:19:10.665 --> 00:19:12.545
If… If you can't see through that,

00:19:12.625 --> 00:19:14.065
you call yourself an investigator?

00:19:15.465 --> 00:19:17.465
Whatever it takes,
I won't let the guilty walk free.

00:19:18.065 --> 00:19:19.785
If you're dissatisfied,

00:19:19.865 --> 00:19:21.145
it's not Sun Zhiwang's fault.

00:19:21.665 --> 00:19:23.665
Who told you to play dumb?

00:19:24.305 --> 00:19:25.385
But I guess,

00:19:25.465 --> 00:19:27.665
when facing the executioner,

00:19:27.745 --> 00:19:29.305
you'll understand everything.

00:19:32.625 --> 00:19:33.545
Your Ladyship,

00:19:33.625 --> 00:19:36.105
the ladies provided a clear sketch.

00:19:36.185 --> 00:19:37.585
Please take a look.

00:19:51.225 --> 00:19:51.985
It's Lu Zhenglian.

00:19:52.865 --> 00:19:54.025
Your Ladyship recognize him?

00:19:54.905 --> 00:19:56.145
He's already been caught.

00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:02.145
Ruyi, do you remember
the appearance of the others?

00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:14.305
These two seniors were there before us.

00:20:14.905 --> 00:20:17.545
The sketch was only possible
thanks to them.

00:20:18.145 --> 00:20:20.705
Have you seen any other clients
without their masks on?

00:20:23.785 --> 00:20:26.625
They were very careful,
always wearing masks.

00:20:27.225 --> 00:20:29.505
Occasionally, we could catch
a glimpse of their faces,

00:20:30.025 --> 00:20:32.305
but… we didn't know who they were.

00:20:33.185 --> 00:20:35.465
Just tell the artist
everything you remember

00:20:35.545 --> 00:20:36.545
about what you saw,

00:20:36.625 --> 00:20:38.505
even the smallest details.

00:20:38.585 --> 00:20:39.705
Understood.

00:20:41.145 --> 00:20:41.985
Emergency!

00:20:42.065 --> 00:20:44.345
Prosecutor Gu is storming
the prison with a blade!

00:20:47.745 --> 00:20:49.025
Prosecutor Gu, calm down!

00:20:50.665 --> 00:20:51.505
Move aside!

00:20:51.585 --> 00:20:52.465
No!

00:20:55.385 --> 00:20:56.225
Gu Lingzhou!

00:20:58.265 --> 00:20:59.105
Don't stop me!

00:21:07.865 --> 00:21:08.705
Wuren!

00:21:10.305 --> 00:21:11.145
Where is Gu Lingzhou?

00:21:11.225 --> 00:21:12.185
Over there.

00:21:53.425 --> 00:21:56.185
Didn't I order that no one
be allowed to approach him?

00:21:56.265 --> 00:21:57.265
Why is there something like this?

00:21:58.465 --> 00:21:59.745
An… An hour ago,

00:21:59.825 --> 00:22:01.785
Sun Zhiwang
suddenly said he'd figured it out.

00:22:01.865 --> 00:22:03.425
He wants to spill everything he knows.

00:22:03.505 --> 00:22:04.785
I was coming to find you

00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:07.425
when the duty clerk reported it
to the Chief Justice.

00:22:07.505 --> 00:22:09.425
The Chief Justice knew your orders.

00:22:09.945 --> 00:22:12.105
But eager to close the case, he said,

00:22:12.985 --> 00:22:14.105
"If we can't question him,

00:22:14.185 --> 00:22:15.865
let him write it himself."

00:22:21.385 --> 00:22:23.225
The Chief Justice had you bring this pen?

00:22:25.945 --> 00:22:26.785
No.

00:22:26.865 --> 00:22:29.505
Your Ladyship ordered
that he must not commit suicide.

00:22:29.585 --> 00:22:31.585
The Chief Justice had us bring
paper and reed pens.

00:22:31.665 --> 00:22:33.345
But after writing for a while,

00:22:33.425 --> 00:22:34.945
Sun Zhiwang complained
the reed pen was too soft.

00:22:35.025 --> 00:22:36.985
I saw he really wrote a lot,

00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:38.465
so I gave him a brush instead.

00:22:39.105 --> 00:22:40.425
I kept an eye on him

00:22:41.105 --> 00:22:42.145
until…

00:22:43.465 --> 00:22:44.625
until Prosecutor Gu charged in.

00:22:45.505 --> 00:22:46.465
I ran out to assist.

00:22:47.265 --> 00:22:49.385
But Sun took advantage
of this little bit of time…

00:22:58.225 --> 00:22:59.825
The pen was already cracked.

00:23:00.785 --> 00:23:01.745
Or it wouldn't have snapped so easily.

00:23:03.025 --> 00:23:04.225
I…

00:23:04.305 --> 00:23:06.465
I really don't know about this.
I truly don't know!

00:23:06.545 --> 00:23:09.345
This pen was specially prepared by them.

00:23:11.025 --> 00:23:12.265
It's not just the pen.

00:23:13.105 --> 00:23:14.865
With all the drama here today,

00:23:15.385 --> 00:23:17.025
which one wasn't arranged by them?

00:23:27.505 --> 00:23:28.425
Your Ladyship.

00:23:29.585 --> 00:23:32.345
Lu Zhenglian, whatever it is, out with it!

00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:34.825
All I'm saying is,

00:23:35.865 --> 00:23:37.105
Princess of Fuchang County,

00:23:37.185 --> 00:23:39.305
your little confession trap
is laughably obvious.

00:23:42.465 --> 00:23:46.065
I only drank
and slept around on a workday.

00:23:47.265 --> 00:23:49.145
If you really have the skills
to convict me,

00:23:49.785 --> 00:23:52.505
cut my pay, demote me. I accept it all.

00:23:55.025 --> 00:23:56.945
But don't you dare

00:23:57.465 --> 00:23:59.145
pin Xiuhong House's filth on me!

00:24:00.465 --> 00:24:01.425
Still refusing to talk?

00:24:01.505 --> 00:24:02.745
Save your breath.

00:24:03.865 --> 00:24:05.705
Someone has already
passed a message to him.

00:24:05.785 --> 00:24:07.105
He won't say another word.

00:24:10.665 --> 00:24:12.705
But just a fine or a demotion?
Don't count on it.

00:24:12.785 --> 00:24:14.345
That wasn't just sleeping around.

00:24:14.985 --> 00:24:15.985
It was rape.

00:24:16.825 --> 00:24:18.905
If any of those women were married,

00:24:18.985 --> 00:24:20.505
add further charges.

00:24:27.185 --> 00:24:28.945
Sun Zhiwang confessed

00:24:29.025 --> 00:24:31.785
that he used Hu Da's position
in the Palace Registry Bureau

00:24:31.865 --> 00:24:33.505
to abduct ex-palace maids

00:24:33.585 --> 00:24:36.865
and imprison them in Xiuhong House.

00:24:36.945 --> 00:24:39.065
He used the embroidery house as cover,

00:24:39.145 --> 00:24:42.025
forcing the maids
to commit immoral acts for men.

00:24:42.105 --> 00:24:43.625
As for those who came seeking pleasure,

00:24:44.225 --> 00:24:46.385
they were all contacted directly by Hu Da.

00:24:46.465 --> 00:24:47.465
They used tokens of identification,

00:24:47.545 --> 00:24:49.065
showing up incognito.

00:24:50.185 --> 00:24:52.625
Now that Hu Da is dead,

00:24:52.705 --> 00:24:54.745
Sun Zhiwang has committed suicide,

00:24:54.825 --> 00:24:57.945
how can we find the other clients?

00:24:59.105 --> 00:25:01.225
As for the other clients…

00:25:01.905 --> 00:25:03.905
I'm afraid it will be difficult
to track them down.

00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:09.465
How about those maids?

00:25:09.545 --> 00:25:12.505
They have all been rescued.

00:25:13.385 --> 00:25:15.025
If that's the case,

00:25:15.625 --> 00:25:19.425
the mastermind has taken their own life,
the victims have been saved,

00:25:19.505 --> 00:25:23.625
and the corrupt officials
have been uncovered.

00:25:24.385 --> 00:25:27.825
You've done a good job with this case.

00:25:27.905 --> 00:25:31.705
You've really lived up
to His Majesty's expectations.

00:25:31.785 --> 00:25:33.745
Eunuch Guo, don't rush.

00:25:33.825 --> 00:25:35.225
This case isn't closed yet.

00:25:38.145 --> 00:25:40.665
Recently, floods in the south

00:25:40.745 --> 00:25:42.945
have kept His Majesty awake day and night.

00:25:43.025 --> 00:25:45.265
You should

00:25:45.345 --> 00:25:48.585
help His Majesty share the burden.

00:25:48.665 --> 00:25:50.505
By Your Majesty's grace,

00:25:50.585 --> 00:25:53.265
I will certainly punish them by the law.

00:25:57.025 --> 00:25:58.145
Your Ladyship,

00:25:58.945 --> 00:26:01.705
Eunuch Guo has made things very clear.

00:26:01.785 --> 00:26:03.945
The matter has caused quite a stir.

00:26:04.025 --> 00:26:06.785
His Majesty needs us to close it quickly.

00:26:08.225 --> 00:26:10.385
But while we wait
for His Majesty's decree,

00:26:10.465 --> 00:26:13.105
let us continue our investigation.

00:26:20.425 --> 00:26:22.265
Who even looks like this?

00:26:22.345 --> 00:26:23.865
The two witnesses

00:26:23.945 --> 00:26:26.545
first said one thing, then another,

00:26:26.625 --> 00:26:28.585
repeatedly changing their stories.

00:26:28.665 --> 00:26:30.105
So the sketch ended up like this.

00:26:30.985 --> 00:26:31.945
Think again.

00:26:32.545 --> 00:26:34.545
What did the person you saw look like?

00:26:37.385 --> 00:26:38.785
You're driving me crazy!

00:26:38.865 --> 00:26:40.065
What good does it do to blame us?

00:26:40.145 --> 00:26:41.905
We were very scared at the time.

00:26:41.985 --> 00:26:43.465
You were there too.

00:26:43.545 --> 00:26:45.945
Why didn't you have the courage
to take off that person's mask?

00:26:46.025 --> 00:26:47.065
Enough.

00:26:47.585 --> 00:26:48.585
Come out with me.

00:26:54.905 --> 00:26:57.145
They clearly said they saw him before.

00:26:57.225 --> 00:26:58.345
How could it end up like this?

00:26:59.025 --> 00:27:00.345
Has anyone come today?

00:27:00.945 --> 00:27:04.105
This morning, people from the Palace
Investigation Bureau came with food.

00:27:04.825 --> 00:27:06.665
Then the artist arrived.

00:27:08.025 --> 00:27:10.225
No, wait. In between, an officer
from the Imperial Medical Office

00:27:10.305 --> 00:27:12.025
came to change our bandages.

00:27:12.105 --> 00:27:13.785
There was no one else.

00:27:14.545 --> 00:27:16.025
Wasn't it that female officer
from last night?

00:27:18.025 --> 00:27:19.505
You mean the office threatened them?

00:27:19.585 --> 00:27:21.185
- Let me go ask them.
- No need.

00:27:21.265 --> 00:27:22.825
Those scoundrels
always resort to these tricks.

00:27:23.425 --> 00:27:24.505
Don't force them.

00:27:26.705 --> 00:27:30.945
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:27:43.465 --> 00:27:44.545
Your Ladyship.

00:27:49.905 --> 00:27:51.025
How'd you track me down?

00:27:51.105 --> 00:27:54.025
Your master told me
when you're in a bad mood,

00:27:54.105 --> 00:27:55.625
you like to stay here by yourself.

00:27:57.345 --> 00:27:59.145
You might as well say you're divining.

00:27:59.665 --> 00:28:00.905
I don't have such a habit.

00:28:03.505 --> 00:28:05.585
You're here to comfort me, aren't you?

00:28:05.665 --> 00:28:09.025
You've been working cases
at your bureau for 15 years.

00:28:09.105 --> 00:28:12.545
Losing all leads just when you're close
to cracking one,

00:28:12.625 --> 00:28:13.985
that must be nothing new to you.

00:28:14.785 --> 00:28:17.505
That said, at least pretend to comfort me.

00:28:18.305 --> 00:28:19.505
It was my oversight.

00:28:20.585 --> 00:28:21.705
Forget it.

00:28:21.785 --> 00:28:23.025
You didn't have the intention either.

00:28:25.785 --> 00:28:26.825
You've found new clues?

00:28:28.025 --> 00:28:29.945
When observing the stars
at the Astronomical Bureau,

00:28:30.025 --> 00:28:31.785
sometimes we lose track of the stars.

00:28:32.385 --> 00:28:35.185
But the stars move
following their own paths and rhythms.

00:28:35.265 --> 00:28:37.305
If one temporarily
disappears from the sky,

00:28:37.825 --> 00:28:39.425
you can find it along the path it took.

00:28:40.025 --> 00:28:41.505
It will always return there.

00:28:42.025 --> 00:28:44.825
Investigating a case
might be more complicated than stars,

00:28:44.905 --> 00:28:46.825
but the principle is the same.

00:28:46.905 --> 00:28:49.065
If a case loses its lead,

00:28:49.145 --> 00:28:50.665
you can return
to the starting point to search.

00:28:52.225 --> 00:28:53.345
You've thought of that too?

00:28:53.945 --> 00:28:55.305
The starting point of all of this

00:28:55.385 --> 00:28:57.305
is the flower that bloomed
on the palace wall.

00:28:58.585 --> 00:28:59.785
Lou Chuo.

00:29:00.585 --> 00:29:02.545
We were originally investigating
Hanxiao's death.

00:29:02.625 --> 00:29:04.985
Lou Chuo deliberately
led the suspicion to Hu Da.

00:29:05.065 --> 00:29:08.305
The place where Hu Da was killed
is near Xiuhong House.

00:29:08.385 --> 00:29:10.025
If Lou Chuo's words are true,

00:29:10.105 --> 00:29:12.105
it's because he hated Hu Da
that he killed him,

00:29:12.185 --> 00:29:14.705
why wait until three months
after Hanxiao's death,

00:29:14.785 --> 00:29:16.865
when we began investigating
the "Flower on the Wall" case?

00:29:17.585 --> 00:29:19.145
He could have buried Hanxiao
in the palace wall

00:29:19.225 --> 00:29:20.345
without anyone knowing.

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:22.505
No need to go through all the trouble
to kill Hu Da.

00:29:22.585 --> 00:29:25.105
Lou Chuo is still hiding something.

00:29:32.585 --> 00:29:34.265
I knew you'd bring something.

00:29:34.345 --> 00:29:35.425
Out with it!

00:29:39.545 --> 00:29:43.145
The old man must've had
you bring me touhua cakes.

00:29:45.865 --> 00:29:46.945
Let's go.

00:30:02.425 --> 00:30:03.545
How is Prosecutor Gu doing?

00:30:04.065 --> 00:30:05.305
Still in deep sorrow.

00:30:05.905 --> 00:30:07.625
But since he hurt a few of the clerks,

00:30:07.705 --> 00:30:08.785
he's temporarily detained.

00:30:09.825 --> 00:30:11.545
Let him rest for a while.

00:30:12.545 --> 00:30:13.585
Make sure he's properly attended to.

00:30:14.185 --> 00:30:16.545
Anyone who dares neglect Prosecutor Gu
will be held accountable.

00:30:16.625 --> 00:30:18.745
When this case is closed,
I'll settle scores with them.

00:30:19.465 --> 00:30:20.505
Understood.

00:30:23.625 --> 00:30:25.025
Your Ladyship,
who are you going to question?

00:30:25.105 --> 00:30:26.305
Why are you asking around?

00:30:28.305 --> 00:30:29.705
I'm going to question Lou Chuo.

00:30:30.945 --> 00:30:32.625
From this moment on,

00:30:32.705 --> 00:30:35.305
if anything happens to Lou Chuo,
you're held fully responsible.

00:30:35.385 --> 00:30:37.505
I don't know who's behind you,

00:30:37.585 --> 00:30:39.265
but I know who you are.

00:30:39.905 --> 00:30:41.865
Whether or not you're one of them,

00:30:41.945 --> 00:30:44.505
Lou Chuo must live if you want to live.

00:31:20.705 --> 00:31:21.665
You were lying.

00:31:22.745 --> 00:31:24.465
You didn't harm Hanxiao.

00:31:25.465 --> 00:31:26.585
You saved her.

00:31:42.065 --> 00:31:43.225
Thank you.

00:31:55.905 --> 00:31:57.225
I actually met her

00:31:58.265 --> 00:32:01.985
in a narrow alley outside Daozheng Ward,

00:32:02.065 --> 00:32:03.465
near Chunming Gate.

00:32:04.065 --> 00:32:05.465
At that time,

00:32:05.545 --> 00:32:08.425
she lay wounded by the roadside.

00:32:09.065 --> 00:32:10.625
I didn't

00:32:10.705 --> 00:32:13.185
even know if she was still alive.

00:32:16.225 --> 00:32:17.065
Hanxiao?

00:32:17.705 --> 00:32:18.785
Hanxiao?

00:32:23.705 --> 00:32:24.545
It's…

00:32:25.105 --> 00:32:25.945
It's you?

00:32:28.825 --> 00:32:30.025
Save me…

00:32:30.625 --> 00:32:31.625
I never expected

00:32:33.145 --> 00:32:34.825
she would still recognize me.

00:32:37.185 --> 00:32:38.185
Hanxiao,

00:32:38.265 --> 00:32:39.105
I'll take you with me.

00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:40.465
Come.

00:32:41.065 --> 00:32:41.905
Take care.

00:32:42.505 --> 00:32:43.385
Come.

00:32:55.025 --> 00:32:56.585
I admired Hanxiao,

00:32:58.465 --> 00:33:01.105
but I never had
any improper thoughts about her.

00:33:01.865 --> 00:33:03.665
I took her back to my place

00:33:04.345 --> 00:33:06.305
and took care of her for three days.

00:33:07.065 --> 00:33:10.425
Only then did she regain
a bit of consciousness and speak to me.

00:33:11.225 --> 00:33:12.745
Hanxiao told me

00:33:14.665 --> 00:33:16.185
she was deceived by Hu Da!

00:33:18.825 --> 00:33:20.025
She thought

00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:22.385
she could live a decent life

00:33:22.905 --> 00:33:25.265
as an embroiderer at Xiuhong House,

00:33:26.105 --> 00:33:27.585
but didn't expect

00:33:28.385 --> 00:33:30.305
they would bully and abuse

00:33:30.985 --> 00:33:31.945
the ladies!

00:33:32.905 --> 00:33:34.625
Hanxiao escaped once,

00:33:36.025 --> 00:33:37.065
but before she could reach
the county office,

00:33:37.145 --> 00:33:38.665
she was caught and brought back.

00:33:39.785 --> 00:33:41.705
Then she was severely beaten.

00:33:42.585 --> 00:33:43.425
Later,

00:33:43.945 --> 00:33:46.425
one of the clients mistreated her so badly

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:49.425
that they all thought
she wouldn't survive.

00:33:50.265 --> 00:33:52.505
They planned to bury her out of the city,

00:33:53.385 --> 00:33:56.225
but she found another chance and escaped.

00:33:57.025 --> 00:33:58.305
Finally, she met me.

00:33:59.105 --> 00:34:00.665
But she still didn't make it, right?

00:34:01.945 --> 00:34:02.785
Yes.

00:34:04.865 --> 00:34:06.065
She didn't make it.

00:34:06.665 --> 00:34:08.465
I tried my best.

00:34:09.185 --> 00:34:11.185
I really did.

00:34:12.625 --> 00:34:14.865
She was just too badly injured

00:34:15.784 --> 00:34:17.225
at that time.

00:34:19.065 --> 00:34:21.985
What did Hanxiao tell you
about Xiuhong House?

00:34:22.065 --> 00:34:24.025
They're a bunch of scoundrels!

00:34:24.665 --> 00:34:26.385
They all deserve to die!

00:34:26.465 --> 00:34:28.304
They don't even treat
those ladies as human beings.

00:34:30.105 --> 00:34:32.105
Hanxiao was such a good girl,

00:34:33.065 --> 00:34:34.385
and until her death,

00:34:35.344 --> 00:34:37.304
she was still thinking
about saving others.

00:34:38.905 --> 00:34:41.905
Did she mention to you
who those scoundrels were?

00:34:42.545 --> 00:34:45.545
She said she had collected
a list of their names.

00:34:47.185 --> 00:34:49.625
But she also said, I'm not their match,

00:34:50.465 --> 00:34:51.985
and I shouldn't take the risk.

00:34:53.065 --> 00:34:55.185
So, I could only kill Hu Da.

00:35:01.185 --> 00:35:02.265
I'm useless.

00:35:03.985 --> 00:35:06.025
I've let Hanxiao down.

00:35:08.905 --> 00:35:12.065
I'm just a lowly night-soil collector.

00:35:12.145 --> 00:35:14.185
I couldn't do anything.

00:35:25.465 --> 00:35:26.425
I've heard

00:35:27.065 --> 00:35:28.865
that Your Ladyship is very capable

00:35:29.865 --> 00:35:31.745
and has solved many big cases.

00:35:32.505 --> 00:35:34.425
But I couldn't see you.

00:35:35.585 --> 00:35:38.145
So you deliberately buried Hanxiao's body

00:35:38.225 --> 00:35:39.345
in the palace wall?

00:35:39.945 --> 00:35:42.105
I was just waiting for an opportunity.

00:35:42.185 --> 00:35:45.345
I didn't even know
where it would come from

00:35:46.345 --> 00:35:48.345
or how long I would have to wait.

00:35:49.985 --> 00:35:51.545
But Heaven is watching.

00:35:52.825 --> 00:35:54.145
Hanxiao's body

00:35:55.505 --> 00:35:57.465
unexpectedly bloomed with flowers.

00:36:04.625 --> 00:36:06.825
To make sure Her Ladyship
investigated Xiuhong House,

00:36:07.585 --> 00:36:08.905
you went to such lengths.

00:36:09.825 --> 00:36:11.545
But since you can even risk your own life,

00:36:12.545 --> 00:36:14.425
why not just tell her

00:36:14.945 --> 00:36:16.265
the cause of Hanxiao's death?

00:36:16.905 --> 00:36:18.345
I am not sure

00:36:19.145 --> 00:36:20.265
if the county princess

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:23.105
can really avenge Hanxiao.

00:36:24.905 --> 00:36:26.745
Hanxiao told me

00:36:28.105 --> 00:36:29.305
those scoundrels

00:36:30.265 --> 00:36:32.345
are very powerful.

00:36:33.465 --> 00:36:35.225
I'm afraid we can't even

00:36:36.265 --> 00:36:37.465
protect ourselves.

00:36:41.505 --> 00:36:42.745
I'm not afraid of death,

00:36:44.025 --> 00:36:45.345
but Xiuhong House

00:36:45.865 --> 00:36:47.785
has many other ladies.

00:36:48.585 --> 00:36:50.065
They shouldn't die.

00:36:51.025 --> 00:36:52.345
I need to know

00:36:52.425 --> 00:36:53.265
if Your Ladyship

00:36:54.025 --> 00:36:56.465
can truly investigate this thoroughly

00:36:57.905 --> 00:37:00.465
and rescue all of them safely.

00:37:01.145 --> 00:37:02.385
Only then will I say.

00:37:04.225 --> 00:37:06.705
Even when I soaked you in that barrel,

00:37:07.305 --> 00:37:08.145
you didn't dare speak up.

00:37:09.345 --> 00:37:11.105
I wanted to tell you earlier.

00:37:11.185 --> 00:37:12.905
Hanxiao once saw

00:37:14.025 --> 00:37:15.465
one of Xiuhong House's clients

00:37:16.145 --> 00:37:18.785
at a palace banquet hosted by Consort Shu.

00:37:21.105 --> 00:37:22.625
That night, he was drunk.

00:37:23.225 --> 00:37:24.265
In the Imperial Garden,

00:37:24.785 --> 00:37:26.385
he touched Hanxiao inappropriately.

00:37:26.985 --> 00:37:28.905
Hanxiao didn't know who he was.

00:37:29.905 --> 00:37:31.505
But during the struggle,

00:37:32.145 --> 00:37:34.065
she noticed a large scar

00:37:34.985 --> 00:37:36.345
on the inside of his wrist.

00:37:37.265 --> 00:37:38.705
It was a burn mark.

00:37:39.745 --> 00:37:41.705
The banquet in Consort Shu's palace

00:37:42.305 --> 00:37:43.985
is usually only for officials

00:37:44.065 --> 00:37:45.745
above the third rank
and their family members.

00:37:47.545 --> 00:37:50.585
I only know that his rank is high.

00:37:52.185 --> 00:37:54.105
While you were questioning me,

00:37:54.625 --> 00:37:57.065
a high-ranking
official suddenly barged in.

00:37:58.825 --> 00:38:00.385
I was afraid of him.

00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:04.105
So,

00:38:04.785 --> 00:38:05.745
I changed my story.

00:38:06.345 --> 00:38:07.825
No harm in being careful.

00:38:08.545 --> 00:38:12.225
Did that man recognize Hanxiao
at Xiuhong House?

00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:14.545
No.

00:38:15.585 --> 00:38:18.265
He didn't recognize her at all.

00:38:19.585 --> 00:38:23.265
But once, when she was being whipped,

00:38:24.025 --> 00:38:26.025
he paid to have it stopped.

00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:28.265
Why stop it?

00:38:30.945 --> 00:38:31.985
Because…

00:38:33.065 --> 00:38:37.065
he said the scars
on a woman's body are disgusting.

00:38:37.745 --> 00:38:38.785
Your Ladyship,

00:38:39.305 --> 00:38:40.465
he was not being kind.

00:38:41.185 --> 00:38:43.625
To him, those ladies weren't even people.

00:38:45.585 --> 00:38:48.305
From then on, fearing him,

00:38:49.745 --> 00:38:51.785
they never whipped Hanxiao.

00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:55.265
Lu Zhenglian still plays innocent,

00:38:55.905 --> 00:38:57.425
denies ever seeing other clients.

00:38:57.505 --> 00:38:59.145
That man's rank was even higher,

00:38:59.665 --> 00:39:00.985
so Lu certainly wouldn't have confessed.

00:39:06.105 --> 00:39:07.145
Your Ladyship,

00:39:07.985 --> 00:39:09.305
Sir,

00:39:09.385 --> 00:39:10.785
please, I beg you.

00:39:11.945 --> 00:39:14.665
Make sure all these scoundrels are caught.

00:39:15.465 --> 00:39:17.025
They've harmed so many people,

00:39:17.585 --> 00:39:19.185
and they killed Hanxiao.

00:39:20.145 --> 00:39:21.025
I beg you…

00:39:31.345 --> 00:39:33.265
You've been poisoned. The bat venom.

00:39:34.025 --> 00:39:35.025
Your Ladyship…

00:39:36.905 --> 00:39:38.065
my death

00:39:38.745 --> 00:39:39.905
isn't important.

00:39:40.705 --> 00:39:44.185
But we can't just let those scoundrels
get away with it.

00:39:44.945 --> 00:39:46.545
I will do everything I can to save you.

00:39:47.345 --> 00:39:48.345
If I can save you,

00:39:48.865 --> 00:39:50.905
you'll come with me
and help bring them back.

00:39:51.825 --> 00:39:52.985
If I can't save you,

00:39:53.585 --> 00:39:55.105
I'll send them to join you!

00:39:58.345 --> 00:39:59.665
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

00:40:03.985 --> 00:40:04.825
Take him back
to the Palace Investigation Bureau

00:40:04.905 --> 00:40:05.945
- and take good care of him.
- Understood.

00:40:11.225 --> 00:40:15.385
NO GUESSWORK
NO DOGMA, NO RIGIDITY, NO EGO

00:40:17.945 --> 00:40:18.945
Don't lose heart.

00:40:20.825 --> 00:40:21.745
Why do you say that?

00:40:21.825 --> 00:40:23.465
You never comfort anyone.

00:40:24.385 --> 00:40:26.905
Lou Chuo is beyond saving,
yet you comforted him.

00:40:29.185 --> 00:40:32.985
A star that vanishes
can still be traced down by its path.

00:40:33.705 --> 00:40:36.545
But a person gone is gone forever.

00:40:39.465 --> 00:40:40.305
Do we still need to investigate?

00:40:42.025 --> 00:40:43.265
Of course, we need to.

00:40:43.905 --> 00:40:46.025
Hanxiao and Taozhi
are already dead by their hands.

00:40:46.625 --> 00:40:49.665
Who knows how many others died
without leaving a name?

00:40:49.745 --> 00:40:52.065
If even I don't continue
the investigation,

00:40:52.145 --> 00:40:53.985
who will seek justice for them?

00:40:54.065 --> 00:40:55.705
Then I will continue
the investigation with you.

00:40:56.305 --> 00:40:58.465
Lu Zhenglian thought,
as long as he keeps silent,

00:40:58.545 --> 00:41:00.825
he would only be charged
with sleeping around or even rape.

00:41:01.345 --> 00:41:04.265
But Hanxiao died after enduring
long-term abuse from him.

00:41:05.025 --> 00:41:06.145
Once a life is involved,

00:41:06.225 --> 00:41:08.305
he will surely reveal something
to save himself.

00:41:11.145 --> 00:41:11.985
I have a plan.

00:41:12.065 --> 00:41:13.705
I've thought of a way too.

00:41:24.825 --> 00:41:26.385
- Who is it?
- It's me.

00:41:34.545 --> 00:41:35.625
What's this?

00:41:36.345 --> 00:41:37.985
The wound on your arm hasn't healed.

00:41:38.065 --> 00:41:39.105
You can't identify Lu Zhenglian yet.

00:41:39.705 --> 00:41:42.185
My mother used to blend medicinal incense
and apply it in steam treatments.

00:41:42.785 --> 00:41:44.105
Strong incenses

00:41:44.185 --> 00:41:46.305
can dye the skin for a while.

00:41:46.385 --> 00:41:47.745
It will take some time to fade.

00:41:48.345 --> 00:41:51.385
Since fresh skin
stains easier than the original,

00:41:51.985 --> 00:41:54.385
steaming it will show
the shape of the wound.

00:41:56.545 --> 00:41:57.465
Then let's begin.

00:42:07.065 --> 00:42:07.905
What is this?

00:42:08.705 --> 00:42:09.785
Tattooing ink.

00:42:13.745 --> 00:42:14.785
What are you planning to do?

00:42:15.745 --> 00:42:17.945
With the original wound,
make an incision in the skin.

00:42:18.025 --> 00:42:19.105
Then apply the tattooing ink,

00:42:19.705 --> 00:42:21.345
and you'll see the shape of the wound.

00:42:21.945 --> 00:42:22.785
Then what?

00:42:23.465 --> 00:42:25.145
Then we'll be able
to identify Lu Zhenglian.

00:42:25.225 --> 00:42:26.065
But what about your arm?

00:42:26.865 --> 00:42:28.665
You plan to carry this tattoo
for the rest of your life?

00:42:30.305 --> 00:42:31.585
It's not a big deal.

00:42:32.625 --> 00:42:33.505
Don't tell me

00:42:33.585 --> 00:42:35.585
about the saying,
"The body is a gift from parents."

00:42:36.185 --> 00:42:37.545
My parents are both dead.

00:42:37.625 --> 00:42:38.585
They won't blame me.

00:42:41.745 --> 00:42:43.105
For Your Ladyship,

00:42:43.705 --> 00:42:44.745
the case comes before everything,

00:42:45.265 --> 00:42:47.945
your health, even your life.

00:42:48.785 --> 00:42:51.025
So diligent, so determined.

00:42:51.105 --> 00:42:52.345
That puts me to shame.

00:42:53.065 --> 00:42:54.545
But if you're injured

00:42:54.625 --> 00:42:56.985
when the next case breaks, what then?

00:42:58.665 --> 00:42:59.545
I know my own limits.

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:02.825
Your limits are simply

00:43:02.905 --> 00:43:05.505
to act alone as always,
never asking for help.

00:43:06.865 --> 00:43:07.985
Is that wrong?

00:43:08.505 --> 00:43:09.745
It's simple, direct.

00:43:09.825 --> 00:43:11.265
It gets answers fastest.

00:43:14.825 --> 00:43:16.585
Have you ever seen a shooting star?

00:43:16.665 --> 00:43:17.625
Of course.

00:43:18.505 --> 00:43:21.705
Do you know why a shooting star
falls from the sky?

00:43:25.305 --> 00:43:27.145
For a star to move along its path,

00:43:27.225 --> 00:43:28.945
it's not just relying on itself,

00:43:29.025 --> 00:43:32.265
but is guided by the surrounding stars.

00:43:32.345 --> 00:43:35.385
Without that guidance,
it will fall from the sky,

00:43:35.465 --> 00:43:37.465
be burned by the fire, and turn to dust.

00:43:38.105 --> 00:43:39.585
Since you asked for my help
in the investigation,

00:43:39.665 --> 00:43:41.945
I must be the star that guides you.

00:43:42.545 --> 00:43:43.585
It's not just me,

00:43:43.665 --> 00:43:45.345
but your master, Wuren,

00:43:45.425 --> 00:43:47.865
Prosecutor Gu, and many others,

00:43:47.945 --> 00:43:49.345
who are all connected to you.

00:43:50.065 --> 00:43:52.545
You don't need to hurt yourself
in the course of the investigation.

00:43:53.145 --> 00:43:54.105
As your colleague,

00:43:54.185 --> 00:43:56.905
I will help you come up with other ways
to solve the problem.

00:43:56.985 --> 00:43:58.225
Your injury

00:43:58.945 --> 00:43:59.985
is my negligence.

00:44:02.225 --> 00:44:03.065
How troublesome.

00:44:03.145 --> 00:44:04.545
I don't mind the trouble.

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:10.825
Because the stars guide each other.

00:44:26.465 --> 00:44:27.305
In that case,

00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:30.105
I have one more thing to ask you.

00:44:32.265 --> 00:44:34.265
When I fell into the lake

00:44:34.345 --> 00:44:36.265
in the palace back then,
didn't you see anyone nearby?

00:44:37.305 --> 00:44:39.625
When you fell into the water,
I was the only one around.

00:44:39.705 --> 00:44:41.745
The palace maids and eunuchs
were gathered on the other side.

00:44:44.305 --> 00:44:47.545
But I can be sure
I was pushed into the water.

00:44:50.065 --> 00:44:52.505
If I had seen the murderer,
I would never have hidden it.

00:44:52.585 --> 00:44:54.625
Even if it wasn't you,

00:44:54.705 --> 00:44:57.065
I would never let the murderer
get away with it.

00:45:00.865 --> 00:45:01.905
This steam feels quite hot.

00:45:06.505 --> 00:45:07.505
Is my arm cooking?

00:45:08.185 --> 00:45:09.265
Apologies…

00:45:22.505 --> 00:45:23.425
Greetings.

00:45:24.945 --> 00:45:26.505
The coroner has confirmed

00:45:26.585 --> 00:45:28.425
that Hanxiao died
after enduring long-term abuse

00:45:28.505 --> 00:45:29.745
in Xiuhong House.

00:45:29.825 --> 00:45:31.545
The scars on her body

00:45:31.625 --> 00:45:33.385
match exactly with the whip
of Lu Zhenglian.

00:45:33.465 --> 00:45:35.385
Lu Zhenglian is the one
who killed Hanxiao.

00:45:36.745 --> 00:45:38.105
Hanxiao?

00:45:38.945 --> 00:45:41.225
Wasn't she killed by Lou Chuo?

00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:43.145
After Lou Chuo met Hanxiao,

00:45:43.225 --> 00:45:44.465
he was seeking medical help for her.

00:45:44.545 --> 00:45:45.585
Without his care,

00:45:45.665 --> 00:45:46.825
Hanxiao wouldn't have lived
for more than three days.

00:45:48.905 --> 00:45:50.145
So, this means

00:45:50.705 --> 00:45:52.825
Lu Zhenglian is the true murderer?

00:45:53.585 --> 00:45:55.345
He can't be completely convicted,

00:45:55.425 --> 00:45:58.145
but he won't be allowed
to live peacefully in prison.

00:45:58.225 --> 00:45:59.265
Bring him out.

00:45:59.345 --> 00:46:00.385
I'll take him back
to the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:46:01.025 --> 00:46:01.865
Oh…

00:46:02.505 --> 00:46:03.425
Hurry!

00:46:03.505 --> 00:46:05.665
Go get him back!

00:46:05.745 --> 00:46:07.345
- Understood.
- Get him back?

00:46:07.425 --> 00:46:08.985
Before dawn today,

00:46:09.065 --> 00:46:11.305
Lu Zhenglian was sent back
to his hometown!

00:46:12.185 --> 00:46:13.265
Who authorized that?
