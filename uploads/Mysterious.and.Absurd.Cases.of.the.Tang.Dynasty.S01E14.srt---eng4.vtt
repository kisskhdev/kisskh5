WEBVTT

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.760
No signs of poisoning

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.680
No obvious external injuries

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.000
The cause of death is the same as Shen Qinghai's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.320
Both had their windpipes crushed by great force

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.520
And were then hoisted up

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.520
What is interesting is this red outfit

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.240
Eye-catching and eerie

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.080
It must be a carefully orchestrated setup

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.480
Meant for the living to see

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.400
The purpose is to instill fear and terror

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.040
Fear

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.720
Shentu Baiqi

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.800
As a Magistrate

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.880
You misjudged a case and wronged the innocent

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.480
You deserve to die

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.000
You deserve to die

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.760
You deserve to die

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.080
I understand now

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.120
Everyone has fear in their heart

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.320
And this red outfit

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.160
May be the root cause that triggers the fear in people's hearts

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.160
Could it be

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.240
That the problem lies with that lamp oil

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.920
The lamp oil contains hallucinogens

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.080
Triggering the fear within them

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.680
No

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.280
This way, my lords

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.920
Please do not blame me, my lords

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.360
I can only lodge you two here for the time being

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.640
Thank you for your trouble, Village Head

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.200
Please forgive your humble servant for speaking out of turn

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.600
I advise you two to leave as soon as possible

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.840
You are officials

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.080
If something were to happen to you in this township

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.000
How would your humble servant explain it

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.440
You can rest assured about that

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.400
Whatever happens to us has nothing to do with you

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.440
Do not worry too much

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.680
I have a question

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.520
The Method of lighting lamps to repel ghosts

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.960
Who proposed it

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.920
Sun Jia

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.920
Thank you, Village Head

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.640
You may go back now

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.920
Then, my lords, please rest early

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.200
If you need anything

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.080
My home is not far from here

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.760
Summon me at any time

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.560
By the way, my lords

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.720
In this pot is lamp oil

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.040
And inside the room

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.320
There are oil lamps

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.680
Be sure not to

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.680
Extinguish the lamps

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.000
Your humble servant takes his leave

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.200
Sun Jia

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.960
Sun Jia

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.840
Sun Jia

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.760
Sun Jia

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.000
Who is it in the middle of the night

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.160
Who is it

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.360
Sun Jia

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.200
Who

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.760
Who is there

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.200
Sun Jia

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.640
The auspicious hour has arrived

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.320
My husband, come back with me

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.400
My husband

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.480
It's a nightmare

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.760
It's a nightmare, it's a nightmare

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.920
I've walked that road since I was a child.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.600
I never expected to meet a ghost that day.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.080
Luckily, I had an oil lamp with me.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.480
Otherwise...

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.400
So you asked the Village Head...

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.760
to tell the villagers...

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.360
that oil lamps can repel ghosts.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.160
Exactly.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.840
At first, no one believed what I said.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.480
Even I felt I only survived by sheer luck.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.800
But then...

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.640
more and more people died.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.440
If you do not believe me, my lord...

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.800
you can go ask Li Laozhang.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.680
He also used the lamp lighting method to repel the ghost...

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.360
and survived.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.640
Village Head.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.840
We found the person.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.160
Dead in the woods.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.920
It's all been handled.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.280
Handled.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.560
Su Qian.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.000
I heard from Jia Liang...

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.160
that you want to leave Wanling Township.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.320
Yes, Village Head.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.880
Leaving aside how scary the ghost is...

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.320
just the cost of this lamp oil...

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.520
I really can't afford it anymore.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.080
I don't dare eat or drink every day.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.080
As soon as I have money, I must think of buying this lamp oil.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.840
This kind of life...

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.640
I really don't want to live it anymore.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.360
Then regarding the matters of Wanling Township...

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.360
how can you guarantee you won't speak of them?

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.720
Rest assured.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.480
What happened back then...

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.920
I will take to my grave.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.680
I won't say a word, even in death.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.280
You said it.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.320
You want me to trust you.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.560
I... trust you.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.840
Dump him in the back hills.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.080
Brother.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.920
Don't blame your brother for being ruthless.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.640
You broke the rules.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.160
You all saw it.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.720
Su Qian is the example.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.280
If any of you want to leave Wanling Township in the future...

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.320
don't ever mention it again.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:35.640
Let's go.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:51.600
Li Laozhang.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:52.960
Li Laozhang.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.040
These two officials...

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.360
are here to ask you about the situation.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.840
You used the lamp lighting to repel the ghost...

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.080
and saved your life.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.000
This life...

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.760
what difference does it make if it's saved or not?

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.520
I have no money left to burn lamp oil.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.000
With the last copper coin...

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.800
I bought some wine.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.600
Got drunk.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.120
If she comes for me, I won't be afraid.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:21.360
She?

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.120
That Ghost Bride.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.040
Such a fine young lady.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:29.720
And just...

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.160
just became a ghost.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:46.800
Poisoned wine

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:50.600
My Lord

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.040
You are indeed here

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:54.760
My Lord

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.400
I must go tell the Village Head of Li Laozhang's death

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.880
Take this oil lamp

00:09:59.280 --> 00:09:59.800
It's safer this way

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.560
All right

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.360
How is the investigation?

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.040
The goods lost from Ten Thousand Nations Inn...

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.360
...have indeed flowed into the markets.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.360
Things are as we guessed;

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.400
it was indeed an inside job.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.560
Furthermore, the sellers

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.760
are all from Wanling Township.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.600
Old Yao,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.280
Hmm?

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.160
Have you noticed?

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.560
Wanling Township has no wealthy families.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.200
Burning lamps all day

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.400
is truly a considerable expense.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.520
And compared to the goods from Ten Thousand Nations Inn?

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.840
Now that you mention it, I remember.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.640
Even the Village Head,

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:37.920
his clothing

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.680
is extremely ordinary.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.040
The money gained from robbery,

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.920
where exactly did it go?

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.040
Also,

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.120
those playing ghosts to rob and those playing to kill,

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.440
are they the same person?

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.000
Then this secret

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.160
lies with that "her" Li Laozhang mentioned.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.040
There is another matter.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.240
On the road to Wanling Township,

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.600
I found someone dumping a body.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:06.760
Let's go
