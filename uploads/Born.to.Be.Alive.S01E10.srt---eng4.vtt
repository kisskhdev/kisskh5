[Episode 10]

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.539
I should be like him.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.180
I don't care anymore.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.500
Do as you please.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.920
I told Duojie earlier

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.590
not to let you into the mountains

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.789
and made you unhappy.

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.310
I was being meddlesome.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.700
Mom.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.380
What are you talking about?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.620
Look.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.250
I said you'd freeze.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.430
You didn't listen.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.500
You never listen to me.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.300
Hurry inside.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.990
Hurry.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.750
Go near to the stove.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.470
Are there any more towels?

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.970
Yes.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.740
Your brother

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.150
named the little foal

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.070
Jiongxi.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.790
Have you two discuss about it?

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.360
What do you want to name it?

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.760
Let's just call it Jiongxi.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.630
He thought the name I picked

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.520
was too girly.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.610
When are you going back to school?

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.800
Tomorrow, I guess.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.320
Where are you going for your internship?

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.410
I want to go to Bolamula

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.650
with my professor.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.560
Once you graduate,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.740
you probably

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.800
won't return here.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.360
The most beautiful girl

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.020
on the grasslands is leaving.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.990
I wonder

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.010
how many young men

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.230
will be heartbroken.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.200
The most heartbroken one

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.920
is of course

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.380
that old man named Duojie.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.280
Dolma.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.730
Dolma.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.860
Dolma.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.300
Dolma.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.360
Dolma.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.780
Duojie.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.500
County Mayor Duo,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.150
you;ve just recovered.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.410
You can't go anywhere.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.000
At least wait for the checkup to be done.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.590
I don't want to do any checkups.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.610
I want to go home now.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.610
Finish the checkup,

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.430
and I'll take you home, okay?

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.020
Let go of me.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.420
You...

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.090
County Mayor Lin.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.159
Reporter Shao.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.790
Are you leaving?

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.540
There are no more buses today.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.770
I'll arrange a driver for you.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.370
No, no, no.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.070
County Mayor Lin,

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.670
I came here

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.930
to report to you.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.250
I've decided

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.220
to stay with the Mountain Patrol.

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:52.270
I've already reported to the leaders

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.330
at my press office.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.920
They agreed

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.720
to extend my creative leave

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.720
by another month.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.380
And I proposed that

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.300
from now on,

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.070
my personal safety

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.410
is my own responsibility.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.210
The county won't be held liable.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.520
Then...

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.000
did your boss agree to it?

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.430
He didn't say no.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.310
Nonsense.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.420
County Mayor Lin,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.190
come with me.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.130
I am not your boss.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.630
Technically,

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.760
I can't control you.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.330
But,

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.409
as the County Mayor of Mazhi County,

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.360
there are a few things

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.500
I must remind you of.

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:39.320
Don't need to write this down.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.670
Right now,

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.450
it is a critical stage
for attracting investment.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.090
Two mining companies

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.890
are already preparing for pilot work.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:46.450
Even if

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.630
poaching and illegal mining in Bolamula

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.180
are facts,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.450
if there are too many reports on them,

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.770
will it be good for the county's image

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.060
or helpful in boosting

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.500
the investor confidence?

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.740
If they get cold feet,

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.130
I have to humble myself

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.600
and beg them to come back.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.190
Shao, I'll say it again.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.490
It's fine if you don't help me,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:05.530
But can you

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.960
not cause trouble for me?

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:10.980
County Mayor Lin,

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.010
news coverage

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.450
is never

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.500
to help someone

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.410
nor cause trouble to someone,

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.930
but to objectively and accurately

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.190
reflect social realities,

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.810
and to promote social progress

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.010
and satisfy the public's right to know.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.950
The story of the Mountain Patrol

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:24.700
moved me.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.220
I have the motivation
and the responsibility

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.510
to finish this report.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.060
As for your concerns,

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.510
I understand them very well.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.600
The economic and livelihood issues

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.980
faced by the Mazhi County,

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.750
I will truthfully

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.690
include them in the report.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.890
Please rest assured.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.820
Goodbye, County Mayor Lin.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.370
Reporter Shao.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:45.440
County Mayor Lin.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.570
Why didn't you go in?

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.890
Did you see Danzhou?

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:52.570
No.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.040
I haven't seen him for days.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.700
Go find him.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:55.360
Tell him to come

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.820
to my office immediately.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.310
[Mazhi County Public Security Bureau]

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.380
I've read the report

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.310
on this operation.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.900
I'll assign you a new task now.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.630
Come with me.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.040
Wang.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.370
Bai is here.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.050
Let me introduce.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.110
You can just call her Ms. Wang.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.570
You must know her, right?

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.370
Hello, Sister Wang.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.420
We know each other.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:13.940
Strictly speaking,

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.370
she should call me Auntie.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.100
I handled all the paperwork

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.100
for her adoption.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:17.690
Yes.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.130
My mom mentions you often.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:19.860
Auntie Wang.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.160
I don't want to be called that.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.360
It makes me sound old.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.130
Just call me Miss.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.360
Come here. This will be your desk.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.010
Yes, just call her Miss. Come.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.010
Just call me Miss.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.160
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.980
Well...

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:32.490
From now on,

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.150
just work here comfortably.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.890
Ask if there's anything
you don't understand.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.409
Ms. Wang knows the operations very well.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.799
Got it. Thanks, Chief.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.940
Don't worry, Chief.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.440
Young people learn fast.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.409
You go ahead and get busy.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.890
I'll brief Bai on the situation.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.350
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:46.100
Sure.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:46.890
Sit down.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.740
Don't feel pressured.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.820
The work here

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.480
is much easier than the Mountain Patrol's.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.030
First, I'll teach you how
to set up a household registration.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.500
This

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.750
is the most basic task.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.210
Then there's
replacing the household registration.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.810
Some herdsmen

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:00.770
don't take good care of their booklets

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:01.370
and lose them,

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.900
so they need replacements.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.000
We went into the mountains

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.050
with Chief Shi and his men,

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:12.860
but we still didn't catch

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.630
that boss.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.740
There are a dozen members

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.050
of the Criminal Investigation Division
and county militia

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.740
left in there

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.070
to continue searching.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.530
We explained the way out

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.430
very clearly to them.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.340
Don't worry,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.900
there won't be any danger.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.490
After all, they have

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.480
much more ammunition and supplies

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.580
than we do.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:36.980
Also,

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.760
Director Zhang still suggests

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:40.480
that you head to the city

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.870
for a checkup

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.010
in a few days.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.270
After all, the facilities there

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.670
-is much better than here.
-Where is Bai Ju?

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.320
Why haven't I seen her?

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.450
She went back to wor
at the Public Security Bureau.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.940
Chief Shi Long said

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.510
he's going to transfer a male officer

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.370
to your team.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:08.840
Yes.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.450
Here are the candidates

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.310
recommended by the Public Security Bureau.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.000
Take a look.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.320
Did you agree to let her go?

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.430
You all agree to let her go,

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.010
didn't you?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.630
Speak.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.070
What are you doing?

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.020
Bai herself

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.770
agreed to be transferred back.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.130
Why are you yelling?

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.330
Talk properly.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.600
She made such a big mistake.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.460
She should leave.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.240
Han.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.980
How long have you been in the mountains?

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.650
Over a year.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.280
I was released in September

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:42.960
and joined you guys since then.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.890
I mean,

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.210
before you joined us.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.310
Two and a half years.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.350
How many sheep did you hunt?

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.140
More than 500, I think.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:07.920
I was sentenced for 500.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:14.870
Zhacuo.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.160
Once on patrol,

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.370
we reached the entrance
of Mountain Fenghuo

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.270
and we lost all the food.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.200
What happened?

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:24.130
It was me.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.280
I used it

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.290
for Kora.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.650
To find you,

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:29.790
we didn't even complete

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:30.920
the patrol mission.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.590
I was wrong.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.510
I already apologized.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:37.550
Sangba.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.670
That time you went home,

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.050
when your mom gave you the cow

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.980
and asked you to come back,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:44.910
what did she say?

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.650
Mom said...

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.440
"If a pillar in the temple breaks,

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.480
one person alone can't fix it.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.480
Everyone must offer support

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.290
to fix it.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.740
If the Mountain Patrol lacks me,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.800
this house will also collapse."

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.060
Today's...

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.120
Wait a moment, it's almost done.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:32.770
How can I help you?

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:34.960
Come with me.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.360
I think it's still too early

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.620
for you to return to the Mountain Patrol.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.030
Are you saying that

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.150
to yourself too?

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.350
What do you mean?

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:57.770
I mean,

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.200
you haven't learned how to fight back yet.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.620
When we herdsmen fight,

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.480
we solve the problems ourselves.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.080
When you wanted to go into the mountains
back then,

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.080
you argued with me,

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.480
and argued with your mom.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.460
Wasn't that because you wanted

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.060
to control your own destiny?

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:15.940
Why is it that as soon as I'm down,

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.200
you stop fighting?

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.030
I just

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.000
can't work with people

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.650
who don't approve of me.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:25.960
No one can possibly

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.420
get everyone's approval.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.100
So this is a problem

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.590
you need to learn to solve.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.190
Everyone has things beyond their control.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.390
Aren't you the same?

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:41.000
You clearly don't approve of

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.290
the development zone

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.010
but you can't stop it,

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:47.150
and you're still at odds with the county.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.390
Yeah.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.130
We all have to learn.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.600
Keep learning.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.860
I thought

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.650
once I was down and couldn't get up,

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:00.580
I wouldn't have to worry
about these things anymore.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.380
But now that I'm up,

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:04.740
it's still our business.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.760
There is an old Tibetan saying.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.360
"If you don't finish the path
you must walk,

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:13.960
you'll never reach

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.360
the place you want to go."

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.210
While you were in the hospital,

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.910
the county held a meeting

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.710
to disband the Mountain Patrol.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.150
I heard.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.110
It was County Mayor Lin
who firmly disagreed

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.960
and saved us.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.360
I know.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:36.870
I didn't expect him

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:37.800
to do that.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:40.290
It doesn't surprise me at all

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.550
that Lin would do that.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.410
The two of us

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:44.240
have argued a lot

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.220
about work.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.240
But we have never

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.100
held a grudge against each other.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.650
Because our goals

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.150
are never for ourselves.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:56.370
If there were more officials

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.670
like him,

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.200
Mazhi County

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.130
would definitely develop better.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.250
Bai.

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:13.480
Captain.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:15.339
The Captain is back.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.190
Bai is back.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:29.720
Bai,

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.400
welcome back to the hardship.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:38.670
♪ We gather here today ♪

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.590

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.160
♪ People who love each other ♪

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.110
There's a bit left.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.770
Who wants it?

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:47.090
Captain.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.680
I'm full.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.260
You guys go ahead.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.550
Give me some.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.180
Bad news!

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.170
Bad news!

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.370
What's wrong?

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.430
Is the wolf here?

00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.200
Chair...

00:18:59.550 --> 00:18:59.990
Chair... Chair...

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.660
The Chairman is coming.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:01.790
Who?

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:02.830
Who's coming?

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.280
The Chairman.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:06.920
We have

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.740
a Chairman here?

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.630
Let him come.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.370
We have to come clean sooner or later.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.880
Shao.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:37.750
Deputy County Mayor Duo.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.440
Welcome.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:40.530
What brings you here?

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.680
Uncle Ding and the others

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.510
aren't used to driving on mountain roads,

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:43.590
so I drove for them.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:45.220
Is that so?

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.930
Chairman Ding.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:48.710
Welcome.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.820
I heard you were injured.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.150
Is it serious?

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:53.690
Thanks for your concern.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:54.890
I'm fully recovered.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.030
That's good.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:57.910
Heaven watches over good people.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:58.440
How is it?

00:19:59.050 --> 00:19:59.960
Let's go inside first.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.330
Okay.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.220
Hello, Chairman Ding.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.820
Thank you for your hard work.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:04.850
Xi.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.060
Hello.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.220
Thank you, everyone.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.080
Let's go, Shao.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.770
Chairman Ding.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:09.310
Good work.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.300
Good work, everyone.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:10.820
Han,

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.290
bring my sister to the room first.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:12.620
Shao,

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.980
I'll go find you something good to eat.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:14.550
No need.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.250
Go sit up there.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.970
Brothers.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.200
Hello.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.240
Don't worry.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.070
I won't forget

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.240
you hungry wolves.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.870
There's plenty of everything.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:38.610
Shao,

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:39.880
The dried beef from Mrs. Nima

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.330
is super delicious.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:42.480
Try it.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.350
Shao?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.760
What's wrong?

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.510
We're not staying here.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.510
Come home with me.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.350
Shao.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.500
Shao.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:57.900
Why would I go home?

00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:59.290
Why are...

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.540
Why are you crying?

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.720
Didn't you tell me

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.240
that you were

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.700
doing fine here?

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.720
How is this fine?

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.750
How can anyone live here?

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:09.910
Shao.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.540
Shao.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:11.900
It's good enough.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.240
This is even a private room.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.970
Same treatment as the Captain.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:16.420
I knew the Mountain Patrol

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.680
has tough conditions,

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:18.530
but I didn't expect it

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.940
to be this bad.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:21.980
Look...

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:24.310
Look at you.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.320
You are a perfectly good

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.260
police academy graduate.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:29.180
How...

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.200
how can you stay here

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.550
and suffer like this?

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.610
I don't care.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:33.220
You're coming home with me.

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.480
-I’ll tell Mom
-Shao.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.250
to not let you stay here anymore.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.310
Shao, listen to me.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:37.860
Shao!

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.640
We're not staying here.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:46.980
Listen to me.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.140
I like being here.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:51.700
I don't like

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.250
working a desk job
at the Public Security Bureau.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:54.960
Besides,

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.680
I'm not suffering here.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.210
Your bank dormitory

00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.500
and duty rooms,

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:00.660
don't they all have hard beds too?

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.660
It's all the same.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.810
How is that the same?

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.700
Look at this.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:04.390
Just look.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.640
This place is so drafty.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.420
How is anyone supposed to live here?

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.110
It must be freezing at night.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.850
Yes.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.790
The house is a bit old.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.300
But look.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:13.810
Shao.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:14.890
Look.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.310
Look how thick the walls are.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.830
When you sleep at night,

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:17.510
it's not cold at all.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.510
It's really warm.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.550
Really.

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:25.090
Don't cry.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.140
It's fine.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:28.740
Stop crying.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.350
You won't look pretty if you keep crying.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.500
Don't give me that.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:34.350
Shao.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:37.540
When you go back,

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.000
don't tell Mom anything.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.670
Or she won't be able to sleep again.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:42.470
Shao, sit.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.230
Sit down.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.530
Try this.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.160
The beef jerky is delicious.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:50.750
Really.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:51.720
Try it.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.980
Why are you crying again?

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:05.810
Shao,

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.000
you and Chairman Ding's son

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.500
are dating,

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:11.300
aren't you?

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:17.850
No.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.020
We're just...

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.970
platonic friends.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.160
Did you forget

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.250
what I do?

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.240
I never forget a face.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.450
He went to your bank to see you.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:32.850
He's that...

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:33.980
weirdo who doesn't feel the cold.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.840
You... you're talking nonsense.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:41.850
Well,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.060
you can't tell Mom about this.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.770
If you don't tell Mom about me,

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.940
I won't tell her about you.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.040
Pinky swear.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:58.360
Pinky swear.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.230
But Shao,

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.250
if you date him,

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.410
and you two are so far apart,

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.190
it'll be a long-distance relationship.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.340
Who knows about the future?

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.350
No one can say for sure.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.030
Just see how it goes.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:23.900
Anyway, he won't be leaving

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.740
anytime soon.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.070
He has to stay here

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.000
and exploit a mine with his father.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.310
But Shao,

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.850
the mining might not happen.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:39.700
Why?

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.500
What...

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:47.840
What do you mean?

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:49.710
Chairman Ding.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.330
We are not doing
mineral exploration anymore.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:53.660
Not exploring anymore?

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.710
Yes.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.350
Are you lacking equipment,

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:57.010
personnel,

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.980
or funds?

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:59.310
Tell me what you need.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.940
We are stopping
the mineral exploration completely.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.750
We are not building
the Economic Development Zone either.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.160
We are planning to establish

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160
a nature reserve.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.400
A reserve?

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.930
What exactly are you protecting?

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:18.110
Protect the snow-capped mountains,
lakes, and rivers.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.220
Protect every flower and blade of grass

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.170
in Bolamula,

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:21.530
as well as the wild animals

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:22.400
living inside.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:24.740
This means

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:26.270
Bolamula

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:28.100
will be completely closed off.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.220
No business activities

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:29.960
are allowed.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:31.670
Are you playing me?

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.320
Do you know that

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.100
I've sunk my entire fortune

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.150
into this?

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.250
You keep changing your mind.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.090
You just want to screw me over, don't you?

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.270
I didn't expect to get rich off you,

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.160
but there's no reason

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.690
to make me lose everything.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.580
How are you going to compensate me?

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:52.310
Tell me.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:57.460
Chairman Ding.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.150
We can never repay your kindness

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:01.670
in this lifetime.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:05.680
You paid the rent

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.640
for this house.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.400
You had someone

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.070
to install the telephone line.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.200
It's fair to say that

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.140
without you,

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:15.520
there would be no Mountain Patrol.

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:17.420
You are like a father

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:17.920
to the Mountain Patrol.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.140
Don't give me that.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.930
Let me tell you.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:23.580
I'm not that noble.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.160
Don't forget

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:27.750
what you promised me.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.650
I lost 1.5 million.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.680
You will compensate me for all of it.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.550
I can't pay this money back

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:37.110
anytime soon.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.030
But I acknowledge

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.030
this debt.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.350
My family's pasture

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.410
produces some Cordyceps every year.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.920
I'll give it all to you.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.130
Keep track of

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.360
how much it sells for.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.000
I think in ten

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:51.390
or twenty years,

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.280
I'll eventually pay it off.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.130
You've really screwed me over.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.280
I'm sorry.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.050
This is my fate.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.440
It was destined

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.430
that I wouldn't find any minerals.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.570
In business,

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.080
you win some, you lose some.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:39.250
This time,

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.980
I lost completely.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.570
But there's no reason

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.720
for you

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.210
to take the fall for me.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:48.570
That's not how we Cantonese

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:49.290
do business.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:50.110
Listen to me.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:58.390
If your family has Cordyceps,

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:00.640
give me some.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.550
Consider it a proof that

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.800
I didn't come here for nothing.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.640
As for the future,

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:09.680
forget it.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:11.510
Just pretend I was never here.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:12.480
No, no, no.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.090
Chairman Ding,

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:15.610
I will definitely

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:16.700
repay this debt.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.380
How are you going to pay me back?

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.050
Take a look.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.580
Just look at it.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.460
Look how poor you are.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.390
Do you want me to raid your home?

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:32.410
What do you take me for?

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.330
Take it.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:43.390
I can't take it.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.380
It's not for you.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.880
It's for the Reserve.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.130
Just consider it

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:54.070
my small contribution

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.270
to the Reserve.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.660
Building some good karma

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.510
for my future generations.

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:34.850
Tashi.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.230
Hurry up and eat.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:37.690
You'll be late for school.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.400
Okay.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:49.220
Take the tsampa.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.730
Eat it on the way.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.070
I'm off to school.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:13.990
The Chairman agreed.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:15.500
He agreed.

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:17.510
I'll bring it to him right now.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:19.960
I saved a little bit

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:21.290
to nourish your body.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:26.720
I'm fine.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.990
You haven't been well lately.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.920
Keep it for yourself.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.770
I don't want it.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:31.340
Keep it.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.370
Why haven't you left for school?

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.590
Mom said

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:12.940
after selling the Cordyceps,

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.470
she'd buy me a game console.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.530
Now the Cordyceps are gone.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.290
And so is the game console.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.030
I took the Cordyceps

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.440
for work matters.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.770
As for the game console,

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:27.170
I'll buy it for you later.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:28.770
Grandma said

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.220
those who break their promises

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.480
will have light souls.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:32.670
Even the lake water

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:34.270
won't reflect their shadow.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.350
So, the one who lost their shadow,

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:36.440
is it you or Mom?

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.510
[Mazhi County People's Hospital]

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.390
Director Zhang.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:21.880
Secretary Li.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:22.580
I'm so sorry

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.440
for being late.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:25.770
Mr. Wang from the cafeteria

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:27.170
suddenly called in sick.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:28.900
I just finished cooking.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:29.810
Have a seat.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.450
Sit down.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.180
Okay.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.420
So the Union Chairman

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:36.120
has become a chef?

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:37.720
Now it's

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.350
Chairman Gewang,

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:41.140
Doctor Gewang,

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.750
and Accountant Gewang.

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:44.040
I don't even know

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:45.790
what I'm supposed to do anymore.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:46.470
We are all

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.700
bricks of the revolution.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.100
We go where we're needed.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.970
Well, it's time to do
some heavy lifting now.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.130
Didn't the city

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.360
just give us

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.800
50,000 yuan

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:58.590
to renovate the shower rooms?

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.380
I've already contacted

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.660
the construction team.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.110
The foreman is from my hometown.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:04.380
He agreed to lower the price

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.960
and take on the project.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:08.180
Regarding this matter,

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:10.700
Director Zhang,

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.630
why don't you say a few words?

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:13.740
Okay.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.070
Regarding the use

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.830
of this 50,000 yuan in funding,

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.250
I have

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.270
some new ideas.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.600
I'd like to discuss with you.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.810
After discussing
among the leadership team

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.310
and a democratic vote

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.400
by all staff,

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.810
the hospital has decided

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.270
to spend the funds
for renovating the shower room

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:37.920
on purchasing

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:39.870
menstrual belt and toilet paper,

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.010
and distribute them

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.180
to the country's 20 pastoral villages

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.220
for free.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.010
The remaining funds

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:46.050
will be used for

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.010
partial renovation

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:48.270
of the shower facilities

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.000
and purchasing work supplies.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.360
Now, let's invite Director Zhang

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:54.650
to explain to everyone

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.660
the practical significance

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:56.990
of the hygiene care plan

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:58.690
for women in pastoral areas.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.240
This investigation report

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.610
on the gynecological diseases

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:07.610
in pastoral areas

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.030
was done by Yan, Zhuang,

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.420
and Lu.

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:13.110
To be honest,

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.070
before seeing this report,

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.030
I didn't expect

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:18.929
the situation to be this serious.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.699
The report sampled a total

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:22.650
of 890 women

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:23.980
aged between 18

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:24.730
and 45

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.090
in pastoral areas.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.440
Among them,

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.690
534 suffered from

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.260
one or more

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.260
reproductive tract infections.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.469
The prevalence rate is as high as

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:35.429
60 percent.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.280
In the past,

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:39.230
we always attributed the cause

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.110
to their poor hygiene habits

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.650
and a lack of

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.280
physiological hygiene knowledge.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:45.960
However,

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.960
after the visits

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:50.110
and investigation during this period,

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.880
the reality I saw is that,

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:53.730
let alone safe

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.210
and convenient sanitary pads,

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:55.949
even a simple

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.620
roll of toilet paper,

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:59.590
many of them can't afford

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.310
or find anywhere to buy.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.200
To this day, they are still using

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.690
wool and scrap cloth.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.940
Under these conditions,

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.190
even if we educate

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:11.620
all the women

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:13.820
and ensure they have hygiene knowledge,

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.880
it won't solve the practical problem

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.080
or lower the incidence rate.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.210
Only by preventing disease
before it strikes,

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:22.960
and treating it before it develops,

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.730
is it possible to change this

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.440
terrible situation.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.010
I believe

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.170
this money will be well spent.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:39.680
Regarding

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.510
the funds for the shower room renovation,

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:44.040
the hospital will continue
to apply for them.

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.460
The higher authorities have also given us

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.500
sufficient attention and support.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:50.690
We'll try to start
in the second half of this year,

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:51.190
no,

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.260
the second half of next year.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.530
We also hope

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:55.890
everyone can overcome

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.780
these temporary difficulties.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:58.500
Is that okay?

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.130
Secretary Li, Director Zhang.

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:00.730
Zhao,

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:02.290
what are you doing?

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.550
I get it now.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.170
The hospital leadership

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:06.480
isn't here to discuss this with us.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.590
You're just here to notify us.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.790
Watch your attitude.

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.390
Sit down.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.130
Don't silent him.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.690
The hospital isn't a one-man show.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.960
If anyone else has thoughts,

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.900
speak up.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.390
Director Zhang.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.710
The people in the pastoral areas
are humans,

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:20.710
but aren't we too?

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:21.650
We all have been looking forward

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.240
to the shower room for a long time.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.940
Every few months you say you'll fix them.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.140
It's becoming a myth.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:27.380
Now the funds

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.500
has finally been approved.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.700
Why did you cancel it through a meeting?

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.560
I'm not saying this

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.130
for myself.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.870
If we were in

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.160
any other profession,

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.030
when it’s too cold

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.820
to shower,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
we just wouldn't.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:42.400
But we are doctors.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.550
Maintaining personal hygiene

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:44.680
is our duty.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:47.280
Sometimes when it gets busy,

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.090
we have to wash two or three times a day.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:50.110
A lot of the female colleagues

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:51.840
have cried because of the cold.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.010
The one who left in March,

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.670
Li Weidong.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.080
How did he break his leg?

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.380
Wasn't it because he took a shower

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.440
and caught a chill,

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:02.470
hence while he was going on rounds,

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.730
he fell off the horse?

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:06.190
Back then,

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.850
he didn't blame the hospital.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.900
Because he knew

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:10.200
nobody could change

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.430
the conditions here.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:16.250
But what about now?

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:19.480
I know I can't change

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.940
the hospital's decision.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.820
But I just wanted to say it.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.610
I feel better now that I've said it.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.330
I'm going back to work.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.070
Sir.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:04.860
Actually,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:05.840
when Chairman Gewang

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.760
organized the staff vote,

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:10.030
some people did disagree.

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:10.730
But in the end,

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.660
the minority obeyed the majority.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.110
I don't know

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.870
what got into Zhao Hai just now.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.070
I didn't expect

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.590
everyone to be so upset.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.440
No.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.830
Most people are still supportive.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.570
Yanzi.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:30.320
Do you think

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:33.150
I made a mistake?

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:37.670
So you blame me, too.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:39.400
No.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:43.380
I just...

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.500
It's the first time

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:46.860
I hear you reflecting.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.460
I don't know what to say.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:52.230
When I was young,

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.380
we had nothing here.

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:57.380
I just wanted

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.390
to cure all the patients

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:01.430
and build the hospital.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.300
So,

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:05.230
no matter how much hardship

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.550
or suffering I went through,

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.000
I felt it was worth it.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.300
I never thought about

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.230
how the things I thought were right

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.190
would make those around me feel.

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:19.220
Times have changed.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.420
I became a mother,

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:25.180
and took charge of the whole hospital.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:28.640
I can no longer be

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:30.270
that solitary little doctor

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.390
who only cares about herself

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:33.540
and her patients.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.530
As a mother and a director,

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:41.220
I've been incompetent at both.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.440
What?

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.190
Aren't you going to comfort me?

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.230
Why are you

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:55.860
suddenly

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.120
so sentimental today?

00:39:58.610 --> 00:39:59.360
I'm tired.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.300
And old.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:05.400
Are you going through menopause?

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:05.930
Get lost.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:06.890
Stop joking.

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.300
It's too early for that.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.340
No, it's not.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.150
You can't go against

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.410
medical common sense.

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:29.770
Did everyone understand

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.000
what I just said?

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:32.320
This is important.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.530
We understood.

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:35.360
County Mayor Duo, you're back.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:36.780
Director Zhang.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.910
We're borrowing your home for awhile.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.670
Please, sit.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.800
You don't recognize your own home?

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.450
I thought

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:47.570
I was at the County Women's Federation.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:48.920
You're actually right.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:50.480
We are discussing

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.130
the women's issues in our county.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:52.570
Come here.

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:53.700
Sit down and listen.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:55.080
Our future work

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.340
will need your help.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.990
What is the problem

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.730
with the women in our county?

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:04.680
They lack gynecological knowledge.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.600
We need to educate everyone
as soon as possible

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.130
and launch gynecological health education.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.440
This is very important.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.210
I won't join the discussion.

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:15.090
You guys talk.

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:16.360
If you need any cooperation,

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.240
I'll tell Lin.

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:18.270
County Mayor Duo.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.130
Duojie, come back here.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:21.800
Why are you still following me

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.570
to lecture me?

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:23.970
Should I be listening to this?

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:25.030
Why shouldn't you?

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.040
Stop right there.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.370
Cairen was sick before.

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:33.450
Did you know that?

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:35.870
Was it a cold?

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.680
Do you think

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:39.040
every illness is a cold?

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.120
She... she said she had a cold.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.080
She always has stomach aches.

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.280
Haven't you noticed?

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.310
Is it like me,

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.110
having a gastric ulcer?

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:52.680
It's caused by a gynecological issue.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:54.780
Don't you start

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.130
having any prejudices.

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:01.490
How did she

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.390
suddenly get this disease?

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.580
It's not sudden at all.

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:07.730
Conditions here are limited.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:10.050
When Cairen and the others have their periods,

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:11.710
let alone sanitary products,

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.260
even decent toilet paper

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:14.030
is unavailable to them.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.780
They have to use wool for padding.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:16.840
That stuff

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:17.780
is rough

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:18.880
and unhygienic.

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.500
It easily causes infection.

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:22.350
It's no wonder she got sick.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:26.400
The toilet paper

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.000
she brought home before

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.920
was actually...

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:29.670
Yes,

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.510
you and Tashi used it all.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:35.640
Director Zhang,

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.600
this is a big problem.

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:39.360
But what can I do?

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.920
Since it's about women,

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:44.270
it's awkward for me to get involved.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:45.150
You...

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.560
in your daily life,

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.420
take better care of your family.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:48.920
Okay.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.680
Stop making Cairen do heavy chores

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.020
like carrying water.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:53.160
Right.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.550
Carrying water.

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:57.020
Okay.

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:02.070
The toilet paper I left behind,

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.900
you and Tashi aren't allowed to use it.

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:04.510
Okay.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.200
It's all for Cairen.

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.560
Okay.

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:07.670
I'll do as you say, Director Zhang.
