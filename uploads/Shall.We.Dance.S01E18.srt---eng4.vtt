Do not worry.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.060
General Xiao did not strike
His Majesty with thunder,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.860
which means he approves
of you two being together.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.020
Duanmu Zhi.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.380
Could you put that more tactfully?

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.980
Xiao Man's parents

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.220
may be just behind that cloud,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.500
watching over their precious daughter.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.379
Lord Zhen.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.580
General Xiao.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.860
I, Chu Ying, will pacify the borders,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.300
and treat the people well.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.940
One day, I will clear
the Zhen family's name,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.740
and restore Xiao Man's innocence.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.340
Your Majesty, look.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.700
The moon is out.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.220
The clouds have parted,
and the moon has appeared.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.380
This year's Mid Autumn Festival
is clear and bright.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.580
What great fortune.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.020
It is a pity,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.500
on a night of full moon,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.111
one cannot reunite with parents

00:02:06.112 --> 00:02:07.632
and family.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.660
To the parents I never met,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.180
I, Chu Wuju, truly cherish Sun Gong.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.740
I will care for him in your stead.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.180
You startled me.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.700
I am sorry.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.420
Sorry for what?

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.100
Duanmu Zhi, look.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.099
It must be Xiao Man's parents
who heard my prayer.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.419
Yes.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.219
They have answered.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.180
They have.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.499
Lord Zhen.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.700
General Xiao.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.140
Please entrust Xiao Man to me.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.260
I will treat her well.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.860
Your Majesty,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.740
please stop saying such things.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.780
Fathers rarely
like their daughters' suitors.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.739
I do not believe that.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.860
Then

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.060
let Xiao Man care for me instead.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.460
Is that all right?

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.659
How can you say such things

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.620
to her parents?

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.940
Lord Zhen would never agree.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.020
Then what am I to do?

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.540
I refuse to believe you
truly think that way.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.540
If I do not believe it,
it does not exist.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.299
Do not listen to him.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.219
Do not listen to him.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.832
Lord Zhen, please do not be angry.
Strike me instead.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.619
The moon is out.
Let us pay our respects to the moon.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.060
The moon is out.

00:04:33.675 --> 00:04:37.380
(The clouds part, and the moon appears.)

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.060
I have no ties with General Xiang.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.740
On the Mid Autumn Festival,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.659
why did you invite me here?

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.739
That day,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.780
in court,

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.380
you read the edict and turned the tide.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.179
That caught my interest,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.020
and I wished to see for myself.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.939
I also had questions of my own,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.540
so I accepted the invitation.

00:05:08.587 --> 00:05:12.460
I hope the General
will share a cup with me.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.860
I never drink with eunuchs.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.860
I only sit with men of real talent.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.820
However,

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.540
do you have what it takes?

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.980
I am willing to face the General's test.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.886
(This young eunuch's looks and bearing)

00:05:30.887 --> 00:05:34.047
(are indeed much like Xiao Congrong's.)

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.220
What I value are those
fit for the battlefield,

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.700
true skill, proven by strength.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.539
I happen to dislike as well

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.659
lightweight spears and dainty blades.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.260
Heavy weapons suit me better.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.379
May I ask

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.220
whether I have passed your test?

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.179
This time,

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.540
I came to ask the General one question.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.219
May I ask, General,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.540
do you still remember
the former leader of the Xiao Army,

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.260
Xiao Congrong?

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.580
Back then,

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.459
the late Emperor ordered the Xiao Army

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.900
to press their victory
and wipe out the border tribes.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.380
Though a general in the field
may act beyond imperial command,

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.739
General Xiao

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.300
did not carry out total annihilation.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.099
Instead, she advised the late Emperor

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.500
that war had devastated
the border people,

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.579
and urged the opening of border trade.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.020
Defying imperial will,

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.820
was the first grave offense.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.980
Because of her proposal,

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.780
the border people
began to rally behind her.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.980
Merit overshadowing the throne,

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.140
was the second grave offense.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.789
Yet all this,

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.149
the late Emperor
endured for Zhen Xiujin's sake,

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.390
for a time.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.099
Until imperial envoys

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.500
went to the Xiao Army camp
to deliver the decree.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.099
The Xiao Army
refused even the tiger tally,

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.580
recognizing only Xiao Congrong.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.779
That act

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.620
was little different from rebellion.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.619
Only then did it cross
the late Emperor's bottom line,

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.860
and stir his intent to kill.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.274
After all these years,

00:07:39.275 --> 00:07:41.474
do you not find the decision
you and the late Emperor made

00:07:41.475 --> 00:07:43.115
utterly absurd?

00:07:44.212 --> 00:07:45.460
Today,

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.780
do you regret what you did back then?

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.100
I have no regrets.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.500
I only know one rule.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.100
Follow the Emperor.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.499
Follow the Emperor.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.220
Always follow the Emperor.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.180
Those who chase reputation,

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.300
whose merit eclipses the throne,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.020
if not removed,

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.219
will one day overturn the dynasty.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.659
It is kill or be killed.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.859
That is all there is to it.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.459
Any survivor of the Zhen family,

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.539
today,

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.260
I will eradicate without mercy,

00:08:18.362 --> 00:08:19.990
and be done with it.

00:08:44.862 --> 00:08:45.982
Stop.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.740
Come with me.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.659
Why did you come alone
to Yanbo Parlor for this meeting?

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.940
Good thing my brothers
and I ran into you.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.180
Who are you?

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.420
I am Yun Shuyan.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.780
Who do you serve?

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.700
The Grand Princess.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.340
This way.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.140
Why did you save me?

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.820
My mother
was General Xiao's deputy general.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.900
My father was Chief
of the Zhenzhe tribe.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.339
My mother died wronged

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.100
in that old case.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.700
What?

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.700
Then why not seek revenge
and instead serve the Chu clan?

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.740
After the Xiao Army was disbanded,

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.700
I was left adrift at the border.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.580
The Grand Princess saved me.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.140
After I became
Chief of the Zhenzhe tribe,

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.580
I became her ally at the border.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.660
I was once like you.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.500
After learning the truth,

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.420
I wanted to kill her for my mother,

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.700
to avenge the Xiao Army.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.139
But as I came to know her,

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.699
I learned she may
seem arrogant and domineering,

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.460
yet she has borne hardship in silence.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.339
For years she ruled
from behind the curtain,

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.820
doing more good
for the people than anyone knows.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.260
So you have given up on revenge?

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.739
When I was young, my mother told me

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.380
the Xiao Army never fought for hatred.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.340
The grudges of the previous generation

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.140
should end with them.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.540
Then

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.860
will you tell the Grand Princess

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.660
about what happened tonight?

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.580
And tell His Majesty?

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.580
No.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.020
Why?

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.540
Because I think

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.740
you should think it through as well,

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.940
how you will live with the emperor.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.300
As General Xiao's daughter,

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.500
how you will lay down hatred.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.140
I do not understand much,

00:11:10.312 --> 00:11:11.286
but I do know that

00:11:11.287 --> 00:11:13.219
nothing in this world stays the same.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.736
What troubles you now

00:11:14.737 --> 00:11:17.337
may resolve itself in time.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.500
The Princess often says

00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:21.492
time brings its own turning point.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.900
Leave everything to time.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.099
Bad news.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.060
General Xiang has been assassinated.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.340
I have already dealt with Xiang Gu.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.980
Now it is your turn.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.940
I have nowhere left to run.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.980
I only ask to die knowing the truth.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.180
Sun Gong, it was you.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.180
I am not Sun Gong.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.140
My name is Zhen Muyu.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.220
I am the son of Zhen Xiujin
and Xiao Congrong.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.520
Then dying by your hand

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.980
is only right.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.380
Then Xiao Man
must also be Xiao Congrong's blood.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.700
What happened back then
has weighed on my conscience.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.260
Zhen Muyu,

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.940
after I am gone,

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.100
I hope you will stand by His Majesty.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.020
I have committed many wrongs in my life,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.339
but my loyalty to Great Qian

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.980
is clear as the moon.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.060
Lord He, you are a good minister,

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.220
but today I must kill you.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.860
I can face my conscience.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.140
We

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.900
are even now.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:07.900
I hope you will not live on with hatred.
