WEBVTT

00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:04.163
Anything else you want?
We still have half a day.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.806
No, it's okay.
I've already gotten more than enough.

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:07.743
Come on!

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:10.512
Well...

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:14.981
Hmm... How about a real sushi bar,
not one of those conveyor belt places?

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:18.318
Or maybe a designer watch?

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:19.554
Hmm...

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.054
Then...

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:28.046
A kiss.

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.583
I want a kiss.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.333
Whoa, that's a bit...

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.502
But you're the one who said
I could ask for anything.

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.971
- Well, yeah, but...
- A man should be true to his word, right?

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.973
That's not the same thing.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.975
Hey, are you trying to run away again?

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.823
- Are you okay?
- Y-Yeah.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.721
In that case, go out with me.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.877
Hey, Hi-ro!

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.577
Simmered sea bream. Isn't it amazing?
I've been filleting fish since this morning.

00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:03.366
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

00:01:05.955 --> 00:01:07.522
Now I remember.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:12.472
A long time ago, someone taught me
how to read kanji.

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:15.975
Because of that, I actually
started to study a little.

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:19.645
Thanks to that person, I didn't have to repeat a year
and was able to get a job.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.927
I'll definitely make you fall for me.

00:01:26.727 --> 00:01:30.557
Ah, ah, ah...!

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.260
Hah! Ahhh!

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:34.171
Whoa! Gotcha!

00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:37.564
Ahhh! Nice. A good stretch.

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:41.201
Hah. Shall we go?

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:44.704
- Date resumes.
- What?

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:46.279
Say cheese.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:49.809
It feels nice.

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:52.246
To be celebrated properly like this.

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.926
Thanks, Hiro.

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:21.909
What is it?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.720
You're the one who requested it, Natsuo.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:26.596
I know, but...

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:28.996
What?

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.052
I want to do it again.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:35.896
Again?

00:02:36.952 --> 00:02:40.530
You said my birthday
still has half a day left.

00:02:41.424 --> 00:02:44.224
I did, but what did you mean
by do it again...

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.002
How about a hug?

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:52.686
Huh?

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.753
I can do a hug.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.454
Hiro...!

00:03:39.153 --> 00:03:40.608
This isn't a dream...!

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.049
Thank you very much.

00:04:02.538 --> 00:04:07.558
Ahh! I was so nervous dyeing a customer's hair
by myself for the first time.

00:04:08.036 --> 00:04:11.927
But the client seemed really happy,
so I'm glad.

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:16.293
W-W-Was I... bad?

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:19.537
Oh. N-No, not at all.

00:04:19.648 --> 00:04:20.363
You were... amazing.

00:04:20.387 --> 00:04:21.828
- Oh...
- Amazing.

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:23.830
Oh, what a relief.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.333
Man, I was really nervous.
My hands were shaking when I was mixing the dye.

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:30.637
Hiro-kun!
I know I'm a little early, but I'm here.

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:32.314
- Welcome.
- Here's a little something for you.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.948
- Oh, it's just you, Tsuboi-san...
- Huh?

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:38.311
Oh, no. I mean, no, no, no, no!

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.792
I-I mean, thank you so, so much
for coming.

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:43.650
- Asahi, show her to her seat.
- Oh, right.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.878
- Okay, this way please.
- Wait, did he just say...?

00:04:45.903 --> 00:04:48.845
- This way. Oh! You must've misheard.
- Misheard?

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.723
- Yep.
- Really?

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:50.567
Yes. You misheard.

00:04:50.592 --> 00:04:52.967
I didn't hear a thing. This way, this way.

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:54.678
- Welcome.
- Come in, come in.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.830
Huh?

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.763
Seriously, how many times have you looked at it?

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:04.677
You've checked your phone
at least ten times today.

00:05:06.044 --> 00:05:07.089
Waiting for someone?

00:05:07.733 --> 00:05:09.344
I'm not waiting for anyone.

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:12.022
Who in the world would I be waiting for?

00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:15.595
"The Proper Way to Write Love"

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.961
Someone s waiting for me.

00:06:17.995 --> 00:06:21.569
(Episode 5: How to Deal with a Love Rival (Traumatic ))

00:06:21.594 --> 00:06:22.747
Hello.

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:26.614
Me?

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:30.323
- What are you looking at?
- You're in the way.

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:32.644
- Why are you here?
- Are you here to confess your love?

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:36.989
Okay, the Button Prince's
love confession is about to begin!

00:06:37.014 --> 00:06:39.332
- Say it! C'mon.
- Hahaha.

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:43.258
Button Prince,
a few words for us, please! Go!

00:06:47.658 --> 00:06:48.691
Totally me...

00:06:49.113 --> 00:06:50.113
Um...

00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:52.880
Welcome.

00:06:53.135 --> 00:06:55.378
- Is this your first time here?
- Yes.

00:06:56.034 --> 00:06:57.489
So, what are we doing today?

00:06:58.267 --> 00:07:01.789
Um...
I would like you to make me look good.

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:03.389
Look good...

00:07:03.878 --> 00:07:06.447
- You have a date, maybe?
- Oh, no, no.

00:07:07.214 --> 00:07:09.991
I was thinking of going to see someone
I used to have a thing with.

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:13.625
Oh, I see. How exciting.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.620
- I think that person was...
- Huh?

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:21.309
I think that person might have
been in love with me.

00:07:21.442 --> 00:07:22.473
- Is that so?
- Hey, Hiro!

00:07:22.498 --> 00:07:23.717
- Natsuo!
- Washizawa!

00:07:26.117 --> 00:07:29.206
No way, Oribe? Is that you, Oribe?

00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:30.717
I knew it was you, Washizawa!

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:33.563
Wow. Running into you here...
It feels like fate!

00:07:33.588 --> 00:07:35.463
What are you even doing here?

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:38.420
- It's been like four years, man.
- Yeah. I was in the neighborhood...

00:07:38.445 --> 00:07:41.020
- and was just about to contact you.
- Me?

00:07:41.643 --> 00:07:43.732
Seriously? Man, that makes me so happy.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.354
That's my line.

00:07:45.448 --> 00:07:46.837
Um...

00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:49.281
Oh, this is Oribe Mamoru.

00:07:49.437 --> 00:07:50.759
An old coworker from a part-time job.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.525
And this is Hiro. And, uh...

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.645
- I'm Shiina.
- Oh, right, Shiina-chan.

00:07:56.801 --> 00:08:00.712
- By the way, Hiro's my personal hair artist.
- Personal?

00:08:00.737 --> 00:08:02.745
- Yep.
- I'm just his regular stylist.

00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:05.457
- Huh?
- Oh, is that all? Good.

00:08:05.482 --> 00:08:06.480
- Huh?
- Hmm?

00:08:06.504 --> 00:08:08.147
Oh, uh... It's nothing.

00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:12.769
- Right this way, Mr. Oribe.
- Thank you.

00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:15.430
- I'll take your bags for you.
- Oh, thanks.

00:08:29.933 --> 00:08:31.122
Who was that guy?

00:08:31.522 --> 00:08:33.874
Like I said, an old coworker.

00:08:34.485 --> 00:08:35.707
What kind of work?

00:08:36.774 --> 00:08:39.129
A convenience store. Did I never mention it?

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:42.154
The company I worked at before closed down,

00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:43.741
so I was working there to make ends meet.

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:45.476
Huh.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.909
You had a crush on him.

00:08:49.665 --> 00:08:50.820
How did you know?

00:08:51.954 --> 00:08:53.409
I could just tell.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.211
What's this? Are you jealous, Hiro-kun?

00:08:59.477 --> 00:09:00.544
Don't worry.

00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:03.433
It was completely one-sided on my part.

00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:07.777
Is he really your type?

00:09:08.428 --> 00:09:09.617
What if he is?

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:12.439
- Weirdo.
- Heh.

00:09:13.817 --> 00:09:15.050
So blunt.

00:09:15.595 --> 00:09:18.062
Whatever.
I'm gonna go grab a drink with him.

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:19.829
It's been four years, after all.

00:09:21.384 --> 00:09:24.481
- Aren't you going to get a wash first?
- Nah, I'm good.

00:09:25.236 --> 00:09:27.392
I just came to see your face, Hiro.

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:29.381
Besides...

00:09:31.192 --> 00:09:33.686
I've been dying to see you
since then.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.367
Is it just me?

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.702
Hey, Hiro. You can head out for the day.
You've been working so much overtime lately.

00:09:57.727 --> 00:09:59.165
- What? Seriously?
- I'll take over.

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:01.534
- Thanks so much.
- See you.

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:03.104
- Good work today.
- See you tomorrow.

00:10:06.905 --> 00:10:09.349
Oh... This is...

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:13.005
Geez.

00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:31.721
Natsuo... Natsuo...

00:10:32.409 --> 00:10:36.209
- Hehe. It looks good on you.
- Where's Natsuo?

00:10:36.234 --> 00:10:37.242
Oh...

00:10:38.764 --> 00:10:41.042
Huh? You think so?

00:10:41.067 --> 00:10:42.364
Yeah, it looks great.

00:10:45.047 --> 00:10:47.358
- This is actually pretty nice.
- Right? It's so cute.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.258
- Edamame.
- Do you wear green a lot?

00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:51.344
Yeah.

00:10:51.369 --> 00:10:54.136
- Oh, really?
- I guess I do. Yeah.

00:10:55.136 --> 00:10:57.693
Oh... Natsuo!

00:11:03.115 --> 00:11:05.371
- Really? Hey, with this one, we can match.
- Natsuo!

00:11:05.396 --> 00:11:07.060
Oh... you're right.

00:11:07.713 --> 00:11:09.012
Natsuo.

00:11:10.091 --> 00:11:11.491
Oh, my bad.

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:14.258
Geez. Here.

00:11:14.536 --> 00:11:15.558
Thanks.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.935
Oh, hi. We met earlier.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.734
Oh, right. Hi.

00:11:22.257 --> 00:11:25.445
Um... do you two
keep in touch outside of work?

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:27.168
Uhh...

00:11:27.512 --> 00:11:30.947
- Actually, Hiro's my boyf...
- No, um, we're neighbors.

00:11:31.401 --> 00:11:33.779
We grab a bite to eat sometimes. Right?

00:11:33.804 --> 00:11:35.990
- Yeah.
- So you're just meal buddies?

00:11:36.015 --> 00:11:37.457
Uh, yeah.

00:11:38.924 --> 00:11:41.301
- Are you holding up okay?
- Huh?

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:44.757
See? He's such a handful, isn't he?

00:11:45.535 --> 00:11:48.890
And that T-shirt. If you don't like it,
you really shouldn't get it.

00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:52.046
He forced you into
getting a matching one, didn't he?

00:11:52.071 --> 00:11:54.335
- Hey!
- Hit the nail on the head, didn't I?

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:55.989
No.

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:58.855
No.

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:02.081
He didn't force me.

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:07.881
I'm the one who wants
to get matching shirts with Washizawa.

00:12:11.503 --> 00:12:12.562
Oribe...

00:12:17.919 --> 00:12:21.852
Alright! I say the three of us
go grab some food.

00:12:21.877 --> 00:12:24.019
What do you say? It's on me.

00:12:24.044 --> 00:12:26.974
- Oh, um, I...
- Don't force him to go.

00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:28.268
- Huh?
- Can't you see you're making him uncomfortable?

00:12:28.292 --> 00:12:29.635
- That's not it.
- Oh, my bad.

00:12:30.659 --> 00:12:31.704
It's just that...

00:12:34.137 --> 00:12:35.148
I want it to be just the two of us.

00:12:37.104 --> 00:12:38.215
If we're going to eat,

00:12:40.448 --> 00:12:41.875
just me and Washizawa...

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:48.487
Then I'll leave you two to it.

00:12:49.698 --> 00:12:51.698
Huh? Oh...

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:53.420
H-Hiro...

00:13:16.845 --> 00:13:18.401
What's with that guy?

00:13:19.212 --> 00:13:21.023
Who says something like that?

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:24.850
And seriously, wasn't it great of me to read the room?

00:13:26.527 --> 00:13:28.861
What's with that weird T-shirt anyway?

00:13:29.572 --> 00:13:31.216
This one is way cooler.

00:13:31.905 --> 00:13:33.239
For crying out loud.

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:41.055
Hello?

00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:44.377
Hiro, what was that all about back there?

00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:48.166
- What are you talking about?
- Oribe was worried about you.

00:13:48.321 --> 00:13:51.221
- Your attitude, Hiro.
- Is this about Oribe again?

00:13:51.877 --> 00:13:53.666
- What?
- It's just...

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.785
- Are you two done already?
- Yeah.

00:13:57.263 --> 00:14:01.085
It seems like things
aren't going too well for him at work.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:02.563
Oh, really?

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:04.152
He's pretty down about it,

00:14:04.796 --> 00:14:08.308
and the fact that he came to see me means
he must be going through a lot.

00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:09.685
Hmm...

00:14:11.049 --> 00:14:13.949
Actually, something like this has happened before.

00:14:14.416 --> 00:14:17.483
Though I'm sure it's different from last time.

00:14:18.416 --> 00:14:19.616
Last time?

00:14:21.214 --> 00:14:23.248
Something like this happened before?

00:14:23.273 --> 00:14:27.281
Yeah... uh, no, it's nothing.

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:32.748
Natsuo, don't get too involved.

00:14:33.733 --> 00:14:38.555
There's only so much you can do,
even as a friend.

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:40.644
I know, but...

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.267
He's weak, unlike you, Hiro.

00:14:43.544 --> 00:14:44.592
What?

00:14:46.584 --> 00:14:50.473
You're talented and strong, Hiro.
But he's...

00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:52.017
What's that supposed to mean?

00:14:52.239 --> 00:14:53.743
If that's what you think,

00:14:53.855 --> 00:14:56.410
then why did I lose the last competition?

00:14:56.834 --> 00:14:58.033
That's not what I mean.

00:14:58.058 --> 00:15:00.621
Then what do you mean? What are you...

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.926
Besides, it's pathetic.

00:15:04.514 --> 00:15:08.281
Running to the guy who used to have a crush on you
just because things get tough.

00:15:08.503 --> 00:15:09.881
How could you say that?

00:15:10.257 --> 00:15:14.112
That's why I told you two
to stop licking each other's wounds!

00:15:15.923 --> 00:15:17.280
Geez...

00:15:39.493 --> 00:15:42.982
Seriously, Hiro, what's with you?

00:15:43.315 --> 00:15:45.049
Why are you so mad?

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:48.463
There was no need to get that angry.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:54.573
Maybe Hiro wanted to come
get dinner with us too?

00:15:57.717 --> 00:15:59.895
Then... he should've just said so.

00:16:05.257 --> 00:16:07.533
Well, I'm heading out for the day.

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.912
Oh! Hiro-kun, see you tomorrow.

00:16:36.428 --> 00:16:38.269
Maybe I'll go grab a drink somewhere.

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:13.791
Wow! Such a beautiful color.

00:17:14.513 --> 00:17:16.958
So it's time for the Schobertii to bloom.

00:17:17.764 --> 00:17:20.764
Oh, this one's cute, too.

00:17:21.108 --> 00:17:22.675
Thank you very much.

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:25.865
Thank you.

00:17:28.442 --> 00:17:31.231
I couldn't help it! We made eye contact!

00:17:33.506 --> 00:17:36.172
- So, you think it'll work out with him?
- Yeah.

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:38.590
But you haven't actually spoken to him yet, right?

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.572
Well, that's where I'm counting on you, senpai.

00:17:41.083 --> 00:17:42.158
You're unbelievable.

00:17:42.183 --> 00:17:44.415
Nah, he's a total pushover.
It'll be a piece of cake.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.392
Like yesterday, I bought a weird T-shirt
near here...

00:17:46.417 --> 00:17:49.018
and he was overjoyed just by that.

00:17:53.005 --> 00:17:54.982
- He's got a crush on you, right?
- Yeah. A pretty serious one.

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:58.040
Plus, this is the second time!
Most people would be suspicious by now, right?

00:17:58.751 --> 00:18:01.513
- The second time? What an idiot.
- Heh heh...

00:18:01.513 --> 00:18:03.086
Who are you calling an idiot?

00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:06.186
- Oh...
- What are you talking about?

00:18:09.618 --> 00:18:11.218
Are you Mr. Washizawa?

00:18:12.095 --> 00:18:14.162
Ah, yes. I'm with this organization.

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:18.751
This is a pyramid scheme.

00:18:18.984 --> 00:18:20.751
No, no, no. It's not like that at all.

00:18:20.776 --> 00:18:22.451
We're a company founded on a solid philosophy...

00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:24.538
Wait, this isn't him. This isn't Washizawa.

00:18:24.805 --> 00:18:27.350
You approached Natsuo just to rope him into this?

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:47.987
So what if I did?

00:18:54.232 --> 00:18:56.110
What's it to you?

00:18:58.488 --> 00:19:00.144
It's his own fault for falling for it.

00:19:00.821 --> 00:19:04.099
It's the second time! He's just an idiot!

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:05.967
- What?!
- Hey...

00:19:07.101 --> 00:19:08.760
Don't tell me you two are actually dating?

00:19:09.926 --> 00:19:14.731
It looks like he's not doing
so well at work.

00:19:15.609 --> 00:19:17.120
Is this about Oribe again?

00:19:18.209 --> 00:19:20.698
- What?
- Oh, uh, nothing.

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.640
He's feeling pretty down about it,

00:19:25.711 --> 00:19:29.562
and the fact that he came to see me means
he must be going through a lot.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.929
I say the three of us go get dinner.
Come on.

00:19:32.954 --> 00:19:35.396
What do you say? It's on me.

00:19:35.729 --> 00:19:39.914
Look, don't worry.
It was completely one-sided on my part.

00:19:40.325 --> 00:19:43.636
I'm gonna go grab a drink with him.
It's been four years, after all.

00:19:43.992 --> 00:19:47.125
Actually, something like this has happened before.

00:19:47.403 --> 00:19:50.570
Though I'm sure it's different from last time.

00:19:51.592 --> 00:19:55.199
Me? Seriously? Man, that makes me so happy.

00:19:55.599 --> 00:19:58.232
He's weak, unlike you, Hiro.

00:19:59.854 --> 00:20:02.242
You're talented and strong, Hiro.
But he's...

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:05.089
This is the second time!
Most people would be suspicious by now, right?

00:20:05.478 --> 00:20:08.267
The second time? What an idiot.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:10.500
But he's...

00:20:12.132 --> 00:20:13.166
That's just pathetic.

00:20:13.191 --> 00:20:15.266
How could you play with Natsuo's feelings
like that?

00:20:17.388 --> 00:20:18.488
Hey!

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.728
- Hiro, stop it!
- Natsuo!

00:20:26.752 --> 00:20:27.906
What are you doing?

00:20:28.173 --> 00:20:30.962
- Hey, are you okay, Oribe?
- Why don't you ask him?

00:20:36.802 --> 00:20:38.190
Actually, never mind. Don't ask.

00:20:38.912 --> 00:20:40.435
And you better not say a word either.

00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:45.123
Right...

00:21:24.926 --> 00:21:25.959
Hiro.

00:21:29.138 --> 00:21:30.493
Open up.

00:21:32.904 --> 00:21:33.960
Hiro.

00:21:42.356 --> 00:21:43.434
It's raining.

00:22:10.028 --> 00:22:11.173
Here.

00:22:14.518 --> 00:22:17.195
I'm sorry. I didn't know anything...

00:22:19.562 --> 00:22:22.106
I'm sorry you had to do that
for my sake.

00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:24.727
All because I was too blind to see it.

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:28.105
- All because I was so stupid, you had to...
- It's not your fault.

00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:32.572
You believed in him, right?

00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:35.017
That's why you fell for it... twice.

00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:39.050
He's the one who betrayed you.

00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:43.194
So it's not your fault, Natsuo.

00:22:43.962 --> 00:22:45.005
Hiro...!

00:22:46.394 --> 00:22:50.652
But you need to value yourself more.

00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:53.274
Stop putting yourself down all the time.

00:22:55.057 --> 00:23:00.090
Listen, you are not someone
who deserves to be used like that.

00:23:00.613 --> 00:23:01.760
Understand?

00:23:05.984 --> 00:23:07.004
Yeah.

00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:28.303
- Hey.
- Hmm?

00:23:28.328 --> 00:23:30.370
What did you see in a guy like that?

00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:33.145
Oh... he reminds me of someone.

00:23:33.145 --> 00:23:34.692
My first love.

00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:37.770
- Your first love?
- Yeah.

00:23:39.165 --> 00:23:42.243
Back in high school,
when I couldn't even read kanji...

00:23:42.487 --> 00:23:45.632
Remember I told you about the guy
who'd write out the readings for me?

00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:48.059
Our messy school courtyard...

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:51.799
and how there was this sweet guy
who took care of it every single day.

00:23:55.467 --> 00:23:56.875
You mean...

00:24:00.138 --> 00:24:01.330
Suzuki Hiromu.

00:24:04.606 --> 00:24:07.129
Come to think of it,
his name is almost the same as Hiro's.

00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:10.929
And the way he loves gardening...
They're so alike...

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:16.831
Wait...

00:24:18.076 --> 00:24:20.676
Don't tell me... Hiro is Suzuki Hiromu?

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:33.214
(Next Episode: The way to hide wounds (emotions))
- Ow! - Hiro-kun?

00:25:33.392 --> 00:25:36.681
- No, no, it's fine. Just sit down, Hiro.
- But...

00:25:36.903 --> 00:25:41.106
Hiro. Here you go. Open up.

00:25:41.371 --> 00:25:44.609
This is the line.
Don't you dare cross it, you hear me?

00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:49.351
What happened to you?
It's like you're in love.

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:51.896
That must be nice.

00:25:52.651 --> 00:25:55.207
Having someone waiting for you.

00:25:55.688 --> 00:25:59.357
- I don't get it! If I don't like it, I don't like it!
- Hiro!
