00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:17.851
Korean wrestler, Kim Il,

00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:19.770
the East Asian heavyweight champion,

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:23.023
challenged the current world champion
from the United States.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.235
The American wrestler
clinched the first win

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:29.696
by locking Kim Il's face and body
with his signature sleeper hold.

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:32.699
But Kim Il came right back swinging.

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:34.493
Known for his powerful headbutts,

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.662
- he was finally able to…
- Kim Il.

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:37.746
{\an8}The headbutt master.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.289

{\an8}Now you might be askin',

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:44.670
{\an8}how the hell did he get so good
at usin' his head?

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.088
{\an8}Tell us, Coach.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.007
{\an8}Rikidozan
got him on his knees,

00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:52.177
{\an8}held his head still,
then smashed it with a baseball bat

00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:55.555
{\an8}and cracked it
with a brick. All right, stupid?

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:57.182
{\an8}That's what makes you a legend.

00:00:57.808 --> 00:00:59.977
{\an8}- You really mean it?
You're damn right.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:02.271
{\an8}Get ready.

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:05.274
{\an8}Wrestlin's all about how good
you can take a hit.

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:07.901
{\an8}Hold your ground.
Better lock your chest, yeah?

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:09.278
{\an8}You're not getting punched.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.738
{\an8}You're taking their fist
and smashing it with your body!

00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:17.286
All right.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.496
Again! Come here, big boy…

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.253
It doesn't matter if you bleed, all right?

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:29.172
Getting bloody's just a part of it.
You think you really want this?

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:33.594
Do you mean,
if I do this I can train under Kim Il?

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:34.720
You kidding me?

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:36.888
Boy, you got a long,
bloody road ahead of ya.

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:41.768
Get moving!

00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:45.272
What you walkin' for?
I said run, you idiots.

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:48.608
You gonna drag your ass all day?
Ya gotta stay flexible…

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.152
…or you'll snap out there.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:52.487
You got this kid! That's it. Move!

00:01:56.783 --> 00:02:00.579
Hey, do you have our money,
or are we tearing this place apart?

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:04.082
Listen, I'm not making any money,
so cut me some slack.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.752
- What do you want me to do?
- What do I want?

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:08.337
How about you give us what you owe us?

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.964
You spent the money you borrowed
and now you're tellin' a different story!

00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:13.342
All right, all right.

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:14.426
Shit.

00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:16.178
Just lay off.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.686
This is it?

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:28.607
Yeah. We wrung that out of him. Barely.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.610
I don't think we can cover one month
of the rent with this.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.487
I'm gonna need you to make this right

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.489
and haul some more crates
at Jagalchi Market.

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:36.573
Yes, sir.

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:37.991
Left face.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:41.995
Go.

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:45.957
Pick it up, you idiots!

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:47.167
Yes, sir!

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:48.752
Let's go!

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:49.961
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

I said, watch yourself, fat ass.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:58.572
Go ahead and let me know
when you're done talkin'.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.991
And I'll drop your ass in one hit.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.840
What's goin' on here?

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:20.260
Uh, we were just asking for directions.

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.846
I'm gonna need to see your IDs.

What brings you here from Seoul?

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:35.692
My husband is, in fact, the chairman
and these two men are my chaperones.

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:40.030
So, then, what's your story?

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.491
I came all the way from Busan
to catch a scammer.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.952
Sounds like y'all
are here for different reasons,

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.704
so what was the staring contest for?

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:51.374
Our friend here has no manners,
so I was just setting him straight.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:54.044
Look, standin' around
in the rain, lookin' all shady,

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:56.129
is gonna scare the locals around here.

00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:59.382
We don't need no trouble,
so just go on your way. Okay?

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.343
Wait, have you seen him though?

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.094
- Seen who?
- This guy…

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.764
He's got a Busan accent,
I'm sure you'd remember him.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.266
Mokpo brings in people
from all over the country.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.519
You think a Gyeongsang accent
would stand out around here?

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:14.064
No, listen. Not a Gyeongsang accent,
a Busan accent.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.524
Can't you tell the difference?

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:16.691
You fucking bastard.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:17.776
Whoa!

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.694
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to here?

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:21.571
Come on, get your hands off, all right?

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:24.533
Where the hell are you grabbin' me?
What the hell is this, huh?

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.496
Just finish up
what you're doing and go. Got it?

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:30.580
Yeah.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:34.668
Next time you bump into me,
I'm taking your big ass in.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.046
So do Jeolla cops make
a habit of taking you in for nothing?

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.548
Scary place.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.967
If you want to, we could just go now.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.927
Ooh. Oh, man.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.345
Giving me chills.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.015
All right, then. Let me through.

00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:52.018
- We should go too.
- Right.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:53.854
Officer.

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.314
All right, this way.

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:09.870
Here we are.

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.251
Uh, these are the guys we're working with.

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:28.847
- Quite a big project now.
- Yes. Shall we talk inside?

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.056
Mm-hmm.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.612
Picking up after her like a
dog, and here I thought you were the boss.

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:45.405
Fine, let's go in.

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:47.616
Let's keep it simple.

00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:51.119
I don't need everyone.
Just Jeonchul and Mr. Oh.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.081
Hey.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:57.667
- Get some beer. I could use a drink.
- Okay.

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:00.503
Also, get us a couple
of rooms at a nice inn while you're at it.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:01.588
Sure.

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:04.841
Oh, and make sure the rooms are apart.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.093
Got it.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.730
You can really make money off of this?

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:22.400
Yes. I wasn't sure at first either,
but it looks like we hit the jackpot.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.027
This seems real big.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:26.196
How much are we talking here?

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.782
Uh, for the rare ones,

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:32.327
what I heard them say…
…is over ten million a piece.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.411
Ten million won?

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.789
That's right. I guess last year
they caught some looters

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:39.292
and the pieces they brought up
were worth a hundred mil.

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:41.753
Hmm, I read about that as well.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.215
So then someone from Busan got involved?

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:47.050
That weaselly looking guy outside.

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:49.177
They call him Professor Kim.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.388
He's a big shot in this field apparently.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.931
How are you splitting the money?

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.141
We're splitting the haul

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.852
and then we're gonna pay
all our guys equally.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.939
Do you mind calling him in here?

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.273
The weasel?

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:03.733
Yes.

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:06.152
- Sure. Okay.
- Step outside, would you?

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:09.989
And, uh, call in Mr. Ha
while you're at it.

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:12.867
Well, you going?

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.160
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:15.870
I'll step out.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:23.753
Thanks. Have a good one.

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:25.672
Thank you. See you again soon.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:29.551
Mmm! Oh, fucking hell, that's good! Mmm.

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:38.435
Hey ma'am. Is there
a decent inn around here?

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:41.146
Well, the best one's
round the corner.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:42.605
What was the name of it again?

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:44.482
Oh, Eonnyeon's Inn, that way.

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:48.695
I think I heard some people say it's nice,
but I wouldn't know.

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:50.697
Eonnyeon's? Got it.

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:52.615
Ah, right.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.492
Can I get some beer to go?

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:57.078
- How many?
- Uh, three bottles.

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:59.164
- And something to eat as well.
- 'Kay.

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:00.248
Damn, you don't have any--

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.750
Come on, lady.

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:03.835
Throw him some anchovies
and send him on his way.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.337
I'm tired of listenin' to his squawking.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:11.176
What you lookin' at?

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:17.932
- How much do I owe you?
- 200 won.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.395
They say people from all over
the country gather here.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.314
I guess Seoul folks are no exception.

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:28.318
But that sissy accent…
It's making me get a migraine.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:32.697
I'm serious,
I can barely hold it together.

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:34.240
Here.

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:36.242
- Thanks.
- You can bring back the cloth later.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.796
Gorilla piece of shit…

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.465
Just breathe.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:51.758
Not worth it.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:09:58.807
Anyone here?

00:09:58.890 --> 00:09:59.933
Yeah!

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.726
Oh, boy.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.354
You got any rooms, lady?
I'm gonna need two of 'em.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.442
Yeah. How about these two rooms here?

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.945
Can I take two on the sides
and skip the center one?

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.614
So you want two
that ain't next to each other?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.450
Is one of them cleaner or nicer
than the other?

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.077
They're all nice and clean.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.245
Try that one there.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.455
Okay.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:26.501
ROOMS FOR RENT

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:29.295
My husband is the chairman of Heungbaek.

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:31.422
We're the one's funding Mr. Oh's project.

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:33.758
So she's your boss in Seoul.

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:36.594
No, I'm not his boss.

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:38.847
We're the ones relying on his help here.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.266
- We appreciate your work.
- It's my pleasure.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:47.021
So I heard you're all here
for the same reason

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:49.440
and you've already agreed
on how to split the profits.

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:50.567
Uh, that's right.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:52.735
I think we could do something better.

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.738
Because as it stands,
it feels like you're all losing out.

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:58.533
If you do the math,
it feels like it's not adding up.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:10:59.951
Do you disagree?

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:02.287
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't worth it.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.332
Of course, but you
won't make any money until you sell them.

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:10.128
The ceramics you find here, they won't be
as easy to sell as you think.

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.338
It'll be hard for you
to get the right price.

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:15.258
Respectfully, you don't know
what you're talking about.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:18.636
This right here, it'll sell
for whatever I say the price is.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.804
You proved my point.

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:22.098
You don't realize that it's your attitude
that will set you back.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:25.935
Hey… …look, lady.
Don't underestimate me.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.354
I don't go after something unless it pays.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:31.357
Do you know how many ceramics
I've sold to Japan already?

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:34.819
Bet I could set up a row
of high-rises with that cash.

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:36.321
Then why haven't you done so?

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.285
Well, so, uh,
what exactly are you proposing here?

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:45.705
Let's make it easy.
I'll buy everything you find.

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:49.792
You'll buy it all?

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:53.171
Yes. 100,000 won a piece.

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:56.174
I'll pay that regardless of whether
or not they might have any value.

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:58.051
And in return, you'll help me sell them.

00:11:58.635 --> 00:11:59.844
Hang on.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.888
Tell us your idea.

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:04.933
If you're able to get
the ceramics authenticated as genuine,

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:07.268
I'll give you an additional 20 percent.

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.437
We can find our own buyers.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.732
And if you get a good price point
yourselves, I'll give you thirty.

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:16.694
If you manage to find 1,000,
well, that's 100 million.

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:20.365
That's 30 each if you split it three ways.

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:23.618
That's good money without having
to find your own buyers.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:25.286
Wait.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.580
I'm curious.

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.540
If you don't mind me asking.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:32.585
What's in it for you exactly?

00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:37.131
Just one good ceramic could go
for 30 million right?

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.760
If just ten of the thousand
hit the jackpot, I'll break even.

00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:43.179
And if you were to help me
get them appraised,

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:44.764
you'll get your 30 million won,

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:49.185
and on top of that, an extra 20
or 30% of the sale price.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.145
I know the people who can pay that much.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.273
Wow, your way of making money

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:56.484
is on another level here.

00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:58.319
It takes money to make money.

00:12:58.403 --> 00:12:59.904
Or so they say.

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:04.409
Uh, by the way, how will we get
1,000 with one boat?

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:07.203
Pardon? You're doing this with one boat?

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:10.832
Any more and we would draw
too much attention.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.333
We're not playing around.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.335
It's best for you to go big and move fast.

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:16.921
With this many people,
you should take two boats.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.549
Uh, the police would notice two boats.

00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:23.720
Suppose I'll have to pay them off, then.

00:13:24.762 --> 00:13:27.807
Out of all of you here,
does anyone know an officer?

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:28.891
Ah.

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:31.269
- The captain?
- He's right there.

00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:32.520
One moment.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.443
- Get in here.
- What'd you say?

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:39.694
Hey, these expensive?

00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:41.571
- Deal me out.
- Right.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.406
They sure look like it.

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:45.825
Come on.

00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:50.371
So, your cop friend. You trust him?

00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:53.541
- Wait, who?
- What do you mean who?

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:57.545
Honggi? That guy and I,
we go way back.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:00.548
Do you think you could arrange a meeting?

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.677
Well yeah, if I call he'll come runnin'.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.764
Uh, why a meeting?

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:11.684
I was just hoping
I could treat him to a meal.

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.234
- Sweet and sour pork's up.
- All right.

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:25.990
- Please enjoy.
- Wow. Thank you.

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:28.409
Are the rooms settled?

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:29.535
Yeah.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:31.621
- And the beer?
- It's in her room.

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:35.917
- What inn are they staying at?
- The hell is this, 20 Questions?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.502
Come on, guys. Let's eat.

00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:39.921
- Table three.
- Okay.

00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:44.133
Whoa… Oh.

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:50.473
Sir.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.352
Hey, man.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:56.229
Fucking idiots.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:57.647
Huh?

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.399
Now that the missus is here,
things sure feel different.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:02.944
Come on. Let's go.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:08.908
The guest of honor.

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:10.993
Hello again.

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.204
So, what exactly am I doing here?

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.373
Good. We already know each other.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:18.334
- Please have a seat.
- Ugh, what's the deal?

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:21.838
Ah, just hold your horses man.
Taesan's on his way here.

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:24.173
Hey, Honggi. You're here.

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:26.175
Come on, sit down.

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:28.469
Please. Join us.

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:30.012
What the hell is this?

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:32.557
Nothing. We just wanted
to have a chat over some food.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.267
All right then.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.726
I'll leave y'all to it.

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:44.277
Over here!

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.237
Can we get more pickled radish here?

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.198
Hey, come on. What are you doing?

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:51.742
What do they pay you for?
Get the man his pickled radish.

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.870
Right.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.998
Outsider, how's your meal?

00:15:58.124 --> 00:15:59.792
Jjajangmyeon taste all right?

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:03.296
Do those hands of yours do
anything or are they just for show, huh?

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:07.383
So, you Seoul folk don't know this,

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:10.511
but you gotta season your jjajangmyeon.

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:14.348
If you don't drown it in vinegar…
…it don't taste right.

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.601
Hmm? You gotta add some real weight to it.

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:19.061
Otherwise it's too bland.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:22.690
It's always day in and day out
with this shit for you motherfuckers!

00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:24.734
Oh, shit.
He's getting mad, isn't he?

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.360
What a clown.

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:28.571
Look, just knock that shit off already.

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:32.575
What the hell? This shit again?
Give me a break.

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:35.286
I don't want things to get ugly,
so just cut it out.

00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:37.246
Oh, yeah?

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:40.082
You little bitch.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.459
Who the hell do you think you are

00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:43.920
- fucking talking to me like that?
- Don't fucking touch me.

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:45.421
Fuckin'--

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.801
- Hey!
- You fuckin' piece of…

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.845
Son of a bitch!

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:55.932
Ah, piece of shit. Come on--

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.229
- You motherfucker.
- Piece of shit.

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:03.231
- Knock it off!
- Fucking asshole.

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:04.941
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.
- Knock it off!

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:07.318
- I'll kill you, you little bitch.
- Let's go, boss.

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:11.072
You better fuck off
before I lose my shirt.

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:12.823
- I'll fucking kill you!
- Let's go, Boss.

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:14.325
- Get the fuck outta here. Go on.
- Let's go.

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:15.868
Ah, fuck this!

00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:21.082
Yeah! Fuck you, son of a bitch!

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:22.959
- No, fuck you!
- Enough, Heedong.

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:25.086
It's over.

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:31.968
Hello!

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.345
Anyone here?

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:35.680
Yeah!

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.476
Can I get a room?

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:44.939
Well, if you want a room,
that's the only one that's available.

00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:47.108
Which one? The middle one?

00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:48.317
Yeah.

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.861
All right, then. I'll take it.

00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:59.996
- You got beer? I could use a drink.
- We don't got beer.

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.832
You're kiddin' me, what kinda inn
doesn't carry any fuckin' beer?

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.041
Damn it.

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:16.304
Geez, you've had a lotta booze already.

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:18.639
Get some rest now.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:29.692
I know doing this is awkward,
but we all need to be on the same page.

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:32.445
If you start feeling uncomfortable,
just say when.

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.905
Otherwise I'll keep going.

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:37.700
I have plenty.

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:40.620
So please just let me know
when this feels right.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.208
All right, then. That's enough.

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:49.837
Already?

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.047
Are you sure that's enough?

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.633
Taesan, tell me.
What exactly are we doing here?

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:57.094
Hey now. What's the matter with
the lady tryin' to show some goodwill?

00:18:57.178 --> 00:19:00.181
Don't take this
the wrong way.

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:02.308
We want you on our side.

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:05.603
But if you don't want to do this,
then we'll find someone else who does.

00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:06.771
I see.

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.023
What exactly do y'all do?

00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:13.069
We're… Well we're just here
to find something in the sea.

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:14.695
- The pottery?
- Yeah.

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:18.199
And frankly, does anything
in the ocean truly belong to anyone?

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.786
You know what they say,
"finders keepers," right?

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:25.956
Hey, so look. You're my guy,
that's why I'm askin' you.

00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:29.293
I ain't askin' you to cover up
some mess or anythin'.

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:30.753
So just help me out here, man.

00:19:31.879 --> 00:19:34.924
You just need to do two things
and you'll get paid.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.843
One. You can turn a blind eye
while we're working out there,

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:41.430
and then, two, you keep
the Coast Guard off our back.

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:42.973
Two things.

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:45.726
- He's got ties with the Coast Guard.
- Oh.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.104
Do they still stand guard though?
Haven't seen 'em recently.

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:51.273
They rotate shifts,
but they're always there.

00:19:51.357 --> 00:19:54.443
Well, could you at least keep them
distracted while we're working?

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:56.278
That sounds simple enough, right?

00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:57.697
Hey, now.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.991
Handling some guards
ain't no big deal or nothing.

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:10.126
All right, then. I'll do it. I'm in.

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:13.129
But… …if this all goes tits up,

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:16.507
all of you are getting booked
on charges of bribing a police officer,

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.175
and conspiracy too.

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:22.847
And this money…
it'll all go straight into evidence.

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:25.641
Are we clear?

00:20:27.101 --> 00:20:28.728
- Yes.
- If you're good with that,

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:33.107
write down your ID number, and, uh,
throw another stack in there.

00:20:36.694 --> 00:20:40.072
And if it all goes to plan,
I'll throw in two more bundles.

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:41.157
Let's work hard.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.033
Uh, it's this way.

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:49.123
It's this room and that one.

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.334
There's someone else here.

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:54.670
Uh, they weren't here earlier.

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.131
If it's a stranger,
then it's fine with me.

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:00.509
That room over there is yours.

00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:10.936
Damn.

00:21:11.854 --> 00:21:13.522
Are you kidding me with this shit?

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.983
Uh, she said this was
the best one she had.

00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:19.320
There's no light in the bathroom.

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:26.368
It's getting late.
You should all get some sleep.

00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:31.415
Uh, ma'am, will you be
comfortable enough to sleep here?

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:34.251
Nothing's ever as comfortable as home.

00:21:34.877 --> 00:21:36.670
If you need anything, I'm a call away.

00:21:36.754 --> 00:21:37.880
Mmm.

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:46.555
Good night, ma'am.

00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:50.851
Let's go.

00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:02.655
You see, then she says to me after I take
my pants off, "Why's it that color?"

00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:07.034
Did you get her settled in?

00:22:07.117 --> 00:22:08.244
Yeah.

00:22:09.036 --> 00:22:10.746
- Is her bed warm enough?
- What?

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.831
The covers.

00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:15.835
- I'm not sure.
- Go make sure she's comfortable.

00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:20.506
Wait, hold up.
What the hell is going on here?

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:25.344
You little fucks.
You gotta be kidding me with this shit.

00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:28.722
- When you went to Seoul, what did you do?
- Shit.

00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:32.309
Hey, how is it any of your business?

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.311
You're not the boss.

00:22:34.395 --> 00:22:36.730
You need to figure out
which side you're on, you bastard.

00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:39.149
Quit scurrying around like a fucking rat.

00:22:39.233 --> 00:22:41.193
You motherfuckers.

00:22:43.153 --> 00:22:44.780
What crawled up his ass?

00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:46.574
- Fuck!
- Huh?

00:22:46.657 --> 00:22:48.117
What's going on?

00:22:49.577 --> 00:22:50.661
It's nothing.

00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:56.542
Go get some morning coffee ready
for the lady.

00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:58.752
- I gotta do that now too?
- Heedong.

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.629
We've gotta do our best.

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:22.443
Ma'am, it's Jeonchul.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.781
You there?

00:23:29.158 --> 00:23:30.951
Oh, shit.

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.287
The hell are you doing?

00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:36.624
Who are you?

00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:40.377
Why are you sneaking around
at night like a damn rat?

00:23:41.879 --> 00:23:45.257
It can wait. I'm sorry. Have a good night.

00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:47.051
What…

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.680
Did he seriously wake me up
in the middle of the night with this shit?

00:24:09.365 --> 00:24:12.159
Whoa!

00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:16.121
Sorry about that.

00:24:16.205 --> 00:24:19.375
Don't be upset.
I swear I didn't see anything.

00:24:21.168 --> 00:24:22.962
Shit.

00:24:23.045 --> 00:24:26.256
Backwater town can't be bothered
to put a damn light in the toilet.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.552
Oh! You're that woman from earlier.

00:24:35.933 --> 00:24:38.435
Okay. What the hell
is that bitch's problem?

00:24:38.519 --> 00:24:40.938
She's so stuck up and shit.

00:25:04.962 --> 00:25:06.964
GOOD LUCK COFFEE SHOP

00:25:16.432 --> 00:25:17.683
Seonja.

00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:19.810
Hey. What brings you here?

00:25:19.893 --> 00:25:22.771
I, uh… Think I can get a pot of coffee?

00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:25.357
Why do you need coffee
in the middle of the night?

00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:28.277
I've got a guest. It's for the morning.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.654
Coffee, my ass. You just came to see her.

00:25:30.738 --> 00:25:32.781
I'll leave you to it.

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:38.620
Man, it must be someone special.
How much do you need?

00:25:38.704 --> 00:25:40.205
Whatever's normal.

00:25:42.249 --> 00:25:46.211
- Is that…
- What do you think? It's pretty, no?

00:25:46.295 --> 00:25:48.047
Yeah, it suits you.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.049
Hey, you wanna know somethin' funny?

00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:53.010
I was just talking to Jongmal about you.

00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:55.054
What about?

00:25:55.137 --> 00:25:57.431
Well, you know. This and that.

00:25:57.514 --> 00:25:58.891
You say anything?

00:25:59.516 --> 00:26:02.561
Stop your worryin'.
I didn't say a word about your work.

00:26:03.771 --> 00:26:05.230
Listen. Well, uh…

00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:10.611
It's just, the other night,
I wasn't exactly thinking straight.

00:26:13.447 --> 00:26:14.823
Which night was this?

00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:18.160
Uh, you know… the one at your house.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.913
So that's what's got you worried.

00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:23.791
I'm not worried, it's just, I'm…

00:26:23.874 --> 00:26:26.251
The thing is…
I'm later than usual.

00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:27.961
Late? For what?

00:26:28.045 --> 00:26:30.464
Don't you know how girls have
that time of the month?

00:26:31.632 --> 00:26:33.008
What are you talking about?

00:26:33.092 --> 00:26:35.010
What do you think?

00:26:35.094 --> 00:26:37.763
Let me spell it out for you.
I think I'm pregnant.

00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:40.474
What?

00:27:15.676 --> 00:27:16.718
What do you think?

00:27:16.802 --> 00:27:19.596
Let me spell it out for you.
I think I'm pregnant.

00:27:22.808 --> 00:27:26.270
- Man, I'm thirsty.
- Huh?

00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:29.273
You're that guy I saw from earlier.

00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:33.151
You sneaky son of a bitch.

00:27:33.777 --> 00:27:35.946
Didn't know she was
such a damn wildcat, man.

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:42.244
What? Let me guess.
You're checking her bed springs too?

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.665
- The hell's going on?
- Whoa.

00:27:46.748 --> 00:27:50.294
That sleazy woman's got the whole block
lined up for her sweet ass, huh?

00:27:51.712 --> 00:27:54.339
What are you doing here so late?

00:27:54.423 --> 00:27:57.467
- My uncle told me to bring her coffee.
- Which one's your uncle?

00:27:59.428 --> 00:28:01.555
Seoul or Busan?

00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:03.682
Seoul.

00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:09.146
Told you to watch yourself, didn't I?

00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:12.733
Was that what it was? I'm not sure--

00:28:12.816 --> 00:28:15.944
- Shit.
- You son of a bitch.

00:28:16.028 --> 00:28:17.863
- You wanna fuck with me?
- Fucking bastard.

00:28:17.946 --> 00:28:19.072
- Asshole!
- Go back inside.

00:28:19.156 --> 00:28:20.699
Keep running your mouth,
you big piece of shit!

00:28:20.782 --> 00:28:23.243
- You stupid motherfucker.
- Keep talking, you son of a bitch.

00:28:23.327 --> 00:28:26.872
- Oh, my God! What's going on?
- Stupid bastard! Son of a bitch!

00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:28.624
Not so tough now, you fucker.

00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:30.083
Get the police!

00:28:32.961 --> 00:28:34.922
Son of a bitch!

00:28:45.682 --> 00:28:46.892
Oh, shit.

00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:49.645
You big fuck!

00:28:51.021 --> 00:28:53.649
Son of a bitch.

00:29:13.502 --> 00:29:14.962
You piece of shit!

00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:27.516
Fuck you.

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:30.769
Fuck you!

00:29:32.229 --> 00:29:34.398
You… you fucking asshole.

00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:00.716
What is this?

00:30:01.508 --> 00:30:02.509
Hey, you!

00:30:03.176 --> 00:30:05.846
What the hell did you do here, damn it?

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.641
Do you see this blood?
They swung on me first.

00:30:10.684 --> 00:30:13.103
You were harassing me
with your dirty looks.

00:30:13.603 --> 00:30:15.439
Okay, I've heard enough.

00:30:15.522 --> 00:30:17.232
We'll talk at the station. Hands.

00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:21.528
Fine. But tell me…

00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:24.865
Professor Kim is here.
I need to know where he is.

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:27.868
Who the hell's that?

00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:30.370
He scammed my ma
out of her hard-earned cash,

00:30:30.454 --> 00:30:31.830
and I was told he was here.

00:30:31.913 --> 00:30:33.457
I gotta bring him back to Busan.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:38.045
What?

00:30:38.962 --> 00:30:40.547
You know him, huh?

00:30:41.423 --> 00:30:44.593
You'd be better off
letting me take the guy.

00:30:50.182 --> 00:30:53.101
What do you think?
Can you hold him for a little while?

00:30:59.566 --> 00:31:00.817
All right, let's go.

00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:04.112
Hey, man.

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:08.825
When he eventually stabs you in the back,
I know you're gonna remember me.

00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:17.209
Are you all right?

00:31:19.127 --> 00:31:21.630
You should go
see a doctor in the morning.

00:31:24.466 --> 00:31:27.928
Heedong, you should stay here.
Keep watch over her.

00:31:28.637 --> 00:31:30.055
It's been a rough night.

00:31:30.138 --> 00:31:32.766
It's just, I got hurt. So, uh…

00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:37.479
Can I talk to you, Uncle?

00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:42.150
Well, now that the loud
one's gone, what else could happen?

00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:44.486
- You should all head back.
- Okay, but…

00:31:45.862 --> 00:31:47.197
Ah, shit.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.580
Are you stupid? You've already
fucked things up after a week?

00:31:55.664 --> 00:31:58.500
You think you have time
to be messing around with girls?

00:31:58.583 --> 00:32:00.710
I drank way too much.
I don't even remember.

00:32:00.794 --> 00:32:02.838
I told you not to drink, didn't I?

00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:04.756
Shit.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.883
Fuck.

00:32:06.967 --> 00:32:09.094
I'll take care of things
with your coffee girl.

00:32:09.719 --> 00:32:10.929
The chairman's wife needs you.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.640
- No.
- Hey.

00:32:13.723 --> 00:32:15.642
This is the most important thing
to us right now.

00:32:15.725 --> 00:32:17.227
I said no!

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.146
Are you… Hey, Heedong.

00:32:27.487 --> 00:32:29.573
What are you yelling for at this hour?

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:31.741
Hey, I wanna ask you something.

00:32:32.993 --> 00:32:34.452
In Busan, did you pull some shady shit?

00:32:34.536 --> 00:32:36.079
- Why do you ask?
- Just answer me.

00:32:36.163 --> 00:32:37.706
Would anyone want to chase you here?

00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:41.251
Someone say something?

00:32:54.222 --> 00:32:57.225
All right. Today,
we're kickin' off the real work at sea.

00:32:57.309 --> 00:32:58.768
Make sure to eat something good.

00:32:58.852 --> 00:33:02.522
That's right. You sure know
how to set your priorities, don't ya now?

00:33:02.606 --> 00:33:03.815
Let's go then.

00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:06.735
I know this place round the corner
that does great yeonpotang.

00:33:06.818 --> 00:33:09.446
- You gotta get the boat ready.
- What, my boat?

00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:12.949
Now that the Coast Guard is handled,
we're taking your boat out there.

00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:15.994
That's right. The waves are too strong
for the little boat.

00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:17.162
All right.

00:33:17.913 --> 00:33:20.415
I'll catch you all later.
I'll see you around twelve o'clock.

00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:23.168
- Where are you headed?
- Seeing off the chairman's wife.

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:26.922
Enjoy your lunch.

00:33:28.757 --> 00:33:30.967
I'll see you guys at the dock later.

00:33:37.307 --> 00:33:38.308
There's five million in here.

00:33:38.391 --> 00:33:40.477
- That should cover it.
- Whoa.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.104
Thank you very much.

00:33:44.314 --> 00:33:47.275
My men can get treated in Seoul,
so that's fine. And that thug?

00:33:47.943 --> 00:33:51.363
Well, he's locked up at the station.
I don't think we have to worry about him.

00:33:52.197 --> 00:33:53.490
And what about the professor?

00:33:53.573 --> 00:33:57.535
Well if his connections to the market
in Japan are legitimate, I'll keep him.

00:33:57.619 --> 00:33:59.246
If not, I'll hand him over to the thug.

00:33:59.329 --> 00:34:02.123
But if you were to cut him loose,
then he's very likely to spill everything.

00:34:02.207 --> 00:34:04.709
Of course.
I'll handle it with the utmost care.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:07.420
Don't worry about my husband.
I'll have a word.

00:34:07.504 --> 00:34:08.588
Thank you.

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:11.716
Right.

00:34:12.968 --> 00:34:15.887
I appreciate the gesture,
but no more gifts, please.

00:34:16.638 --> 00:34:19.182
Useless gifts are just extra baggage.

00:34:19.766 --> 00:34:22.560
Right, got it. Here. For you.

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.355
- What's this?
- A souvenir.

00:34:25.438 --> 00:34:27.482
The first ceramic
that we were able to recover.

00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:29.276
- The one from yesterday.
- Oh.

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.195
Please let me know
as they start coming in.

00:34:32.279 --> 00:34:33.738
And keep up the good work.

00:34:33.822 --> 00:34:35.073
We'll do our best, ma'am.

00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:41.371
Safe travels.

00:34:48.128 --> 00:34:49.379
GOOD LUCK COFFEE SHOP

00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:51.214
Welcome.

00:34:53.466 --> 00:34:56.177
I-Is there a Seonja who works here?

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:59.222
Really? Again?

00:34:59.306 --> 00:35:00.432
Hey, Seonja.

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:02.517
This gentleman is asking for you.

00:35:03.852 --> 00:35:05.437
Why are you looking for her? Who are you?

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.648
Wait, are you my third cousin's daughter?

00:35:08.732 --> 00:35:11.234
We spoke on the phone.
Oh Gwanseok.

00:35:11.318 --> 00:35:13.111
Oh, wow. Would you look at that?

00:35:13.194 --> 00:35:15.488
I haven't seen you
since you were a little babe.

00:35:15.572 --> 00:35:18.158
Yeah, I barely recognized you
there for a second.

00:35:18.241 --> 00:35:19.534
Uh, who are you?

00:35:19.618 --> 00:35:20.869
Hi. I'm Heedong's uncle.

00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:25.832
Listen, is it okay
if I borrow her for a while?

00:35:30.003 --> 00:35:32.297
Hey mister,
how much did you pay my boss,

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.341
that she's okay with me leaving like this?

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.636
Don't even ask.

00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:39.137
She drove a hard bargain.

00:35:39.846 --> 00:35:41.556
She really cleaned me out.

00:35:42.766 --> 00:35:44.351
Is Heedong coming?

00:35:44.434 --> 00:35:45.810
Yeah, he's on his way.

00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:50.732
My stomach.

00:35:51.941 --> 00:35:54.903
I don't think the food here
is agreeing with my gut.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:57.030
Can we swing by the doctor's?

00:35:57.113 --> 00:35:58.698
Geez, that's rough.

00:35:59.407 --> 00:36:00.950
- Let's hurry then.
- Yeah.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:03.995
Oh, there it is.

00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:07.707
Ow, my stomach.

00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:09.376
"SPECIALTIES

00:36:09.459 --> 00:36:10.543
All right.

00:36:13.546 --> 00:36:15.256
You're right,
the clinic's right here.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.008
- It's like you already knew.
- Oh, you're here.

00:36:18.968 --> 00:36:20.428
One second, please.

00:36:20.512 --> 00:36:21.680
Yeah.

00:36:21.763 --> 00:36:23.807
Who's that? Do you know her?

00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:26.643
I was here before.

00:36:26.726 --> 00:36:29.479
Damn. I guess it's really bad.

00:36:29.562 --> 00:36:31.106
Oh, ouch!

00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:34.067
I hear with diarrhea,
you just gotta let it run its course.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.819
Oh, it hurts.

"DOCTOR'S OFFICE"

00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:38.571
Hi, there. Let's get you inside.

00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:44.577
They're waiting.

00:36:47.706 --> 00:36:49.457
- All right.
- Wait, aren't you the one going in?

00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:50.959
Won't take long.

00:36:51.584 --> 00:36:53.712
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Get her legs.

00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:55.004
No, you got it all wrong!

00:36:55.088 --> 00:36:57.424
The guy outside,
he's the one with the runs, you know!

00:36:57.507 --> 00:37:00.343
- Grab her legs there. Hold her.
- No, let go! It's not me!

{\an8}MRS. YANG: FIVE MILLION WON

00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:05.682
Oh.

00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:11.020
You were worried for nothing.
She's not pregnant.

00:37:11.104 --> 00:37:13.314
- What?
- She says they never slept together.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.949
Excuse me.
Could you give us a moment alone?

00:37:26.661 --> 00:37:28.496
Shit.

00:37:30.165 --> 00:37:31.541
Hey.

00:37:33.626 --> 00:37:35.587
Why'd you tell Heedong you were pregnant?

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.381
I wanted to move to Seoul.

00:37:38.465 --> 00:37:40.049
You little sh…

00:37:40.967 --> 00:37:42.927
You didn't think you'd get caught?

00:37:43.011 --> 00:37:45.722
I'm sorry.

00:37:46.347 --> 00:37:48.516
I'm really sorry.

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:51.770
I don't believe this.

00:37:56.775 --> 00:37:58.526
Nothing happened today.

00:38:02.155 --> 00:38:04.407
Where'd you even learn to pull this shit?

00:38:06.242 --> 00:38:08.703
Here, buy yourself something nice.

00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:11.164
Just take it.

00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:29.182
Fucking idiot.

00:38:44.572 --> 00:38:47.200
The chairman is at the factory
in Yongin right now.

00:38:47.283 --> 00:38:48.493
Would you like to head there?

00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:50.954
No. I would like to stop by Jongno.

00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:53.623
You boys should go see a doctor.

00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:57.126
- We're fine, ma'am.
- Just go while you still can.

00:38:57.961 --> 00:39:01.047
And if the chairman asks you, tell him
things were really rough down there.

00:39:01.714 --> 00:39:04.968
Lots of big guys coming at you
everywhere you looked. You got that?

00:39:05.718 --> 00:39:07.637
Ma'am.

00:39:09.514 --> 00:39:13.852
MARILYN BOUTIQUE

00:39:20.942 --> 00:39:22.694
- They don't go together.
- Oh, okay.

00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:25.321
- Hey, girl!
- Good afternoon.

00:39:25.405 --> 00:39:28.283
I'm tired.
I just got back from Mokpo.

00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:29.576
What's in Mokpo?

00:39:29.659 --> 00:39:32.287
I wanna show you something. Come here.

00:39:33.162 --> 00:39:34.414
What's that?

00:39:34.998 --> 00:39:36.332
They got it in Sinan.

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:39.043
What is it?

00:39:39.127 --> 00:39:40.920
- Oh, it looks ancient.
- Does it?

00:39:41.838 --> 00:39:43.464
Are these barnacles right here?

00:39:43.548 --> 00:39:45.717
Mmm. They found it under the sea.

00:39:46.467 --> 00:39:47.677
Really?

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.597
Well, that aside, can I borrow some money?

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.308
- Well, how much?
- Can you do 50 million?

00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:56.102
I don't have that kind of money.

00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:57.645
Can you give me 10 million?

00:39:58.313 --> 00:40:00.607
You're getting involved
in some big business.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:03.109
What can I do?
Gotta keep the chairman happy.

00:40:03.192 --> 00:40:06.863
Wow, isn't he a lucky guy?
Has a wife who can rake in the cash.

00:40:06.946 --> 00:40:08.615
Can I make a call?

00:40:08.698 --> 00:40:10.825
You know you don't have to ask anymore.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.922
Good afternoon, do you have a minute?
This is Chairman Cheon's wife, Jungsook.

00:40:28.509 --> 00:40:30.470
What's wrong? Is it too little?

00:40:31.846 --> 00:40:33.097
Hold on.

00:40:33.181 --> 00:40:36.309
I admit, I'm a little confused, ma'am.
Why are you suggesting this?

00:40:36.392 --> 00:40:38.978
It's not a suggestion.
I'm changing the deal, right now.

00:40:39.062 --> 00:40:40.813
Since you came back from Mokpo,

00:40:40.897 --> 00:40:42.774
you seem different.

00:40:42.857 --> 00:40:45.109
I bet you must've seen
something worthwhile.

00:40:45.193 --> 00:40:47.570
Well, one has to be flexible
in their thinking.

00:40:47.654 --> 00:40:49.989
Remember what the chairman asked?

00:40:50.073 --> 00:40:51.908
For us to secure and find genuine pieces.

00:40:51.991 --> 00:40:54.911
And to do that,
we need to manage what we find.

00:40:54.994 --> 00:40:57.956
You can handle that however you want.
Just let go of the ones from Sinan.

00:40:58.039 --> 00:41:01.584
With all due respect,
cutting us out of the deal like this…

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.295
It isn't exactly fair to us.

00:41:05.004 --> 00:41:07.382
They only get value
after we appraise them.

00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:10.009
If you try to sell them yourself,
you won't get far.

00:41:10.093 --> 00:41:12.178
I've already lined up
a few other appraisers,

00:41:12.261 --> 00:41:14.806
and nothing good comes
from having too many cooks.

00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:17.100
Damn it.

00:41:17.684 --> 00:41:19.519
If we're all done here, gentlemen,
I'll just be on my way.

00:41:19.602 --> 00:41:20.853
Wait, but--

00:41:20.937 --> 00:41:24.649
And from now on, everything Sinan,
people and ceramics,

00:41:24.732 --> 00:41:26.359
they all belong to me.

00:41:29.946 --> 00:41:31.864
- No, wait…
- Uh, w--

00:41:33.032 --> 00:41:34.075
Finally, there he is.

00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:38.788
Damn, it must've been
one hell of a send-off then.

00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:40.665
We've just been sittin' on our asses here.

00:41:40.748 --> 00:41:42.542
Sorry about that.

00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:44.168
Are we all ready to go?

00:41:44.252 --> 00:41:45.795
Hours ago, man.

00:41:45.878 --> 00:41:48.339
What about you? You ready to go?

00:41:49.257 --> 00:41:50.258
Yeah.

00:41:50.758 --> 00:41:52.260
It's all taken care of.

00:41:53.136 --> 00:41:55.096
- And the boat?
- Right here.

00:41:55.847 --> 00:41:58.516
Man, bigger is better. Isn't that right?

00:41:59.225 --> 00:42:00.309
Let's head out.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.397
Watch your step.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.606
Geez.

00:42:10.778 --> 00:42:13.114
YONGJIN

00:42:18.036 --> 00:42:20.163
Now that we switched boats,
you got something to do.

00:42:20.246 --> 00:42:21.539
What do you mean?

00:42:21.622 --> 00:42:23.791
You don't have to dive
now that you're steering, so that's good!

00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:25.668
I can still go in if you want.

00:42:25.752 --> 00:42:28.755
- It's not like I'm scared of it.
- Uh-huh.

00:42:28.838 --> 00:42:30.048
Sure.

00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:34.927
Hey guys, we're almost there!
Look for the buoy!

00:42:35.011 --> 00:42:36.095
Look for the buoy!

00:42:37.263 --> 00:42:38.347
There it is!

00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:42.518
All right. We're close.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:47.190
Hey, Bokgeun, drop anchor!

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.400
Drop the anchor!

00:42:58.743 --> 00:43:00.870
Look, the tide's about to change.
We gotta get goin' here!

00:43:00.953 --> 00:43:02.330
Okay. Get ready, fellas!

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:04.248
Who here knows how to dive?

00:43:04.332 --> 00:43:07.710
- Well, Seokbae's the expert.
- Bokgeun, can't you do it?

00:43:07.794 --> 00:43:10.421
- I've never done it before.
- Fucking idiot.

00:43:10.505 --> 00:43:14.175
All right, who's up?
Who's going first?

00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:15.551
I thought you were.

00:43:16.177 --> 00:43:17.512
Nah, I'm goin' in with the air tank.

00:43:17.595 --> 00:43:20.098
Beolgu. You're up first, got that?

00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:21.974
Nah, I'm not doin' that shit.

00:43:22.058 --> 00:43:23.893
All right, enough, we're all taking turns!

00:43:23.976 --> 00:43:27.021
Yeah, you're all takin' turns.
So quit your whinin'.

00:43:27.105 --> 00:43:29.273
I don't wanna go. I ain't doin' it.

00:43:29.357 --> 00:43:30.858
Also, why the hell am I first?

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.238
Hey, get in there.

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.199
How you gonna send someone
who barely knows the water?

00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:40.952
- Besides, you grew up by the sea.
- Just jump in there!

00:43:41.536 --> 00:43:42.912
Wow.

00:43:42.995 --> 00:43:45.456
We got a whole boat
full of useless assholes.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.500
If you're not goin' in, why are you here?

00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:49.377
We'll go back to Jeungdo and drop you off.

00:43:50.878 --> 00:43:52.505
Here you go, put this on.

00:43:53.422 --> 00:43:55.758
The water's freezing down there.
You're gonna need it.

00:43:55.842 --> 00:43:57.176
Forget it.

00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.594
You serious?

00:43:59.846 --> 00:44:01.889
All right, fellas. Gather round.

00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:04.267
Fine.

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.145
If you look inside,
you see that button right there?

00:44:07.228 --> 00:44:09.147
You press into it
with your head like this,

00:44:09.897 --> 00:44:13.609
it'll release the air inside of your suit,
and your ass will sink straight down.

00:44:13.693 --> 00:44:17.155
And if you ain't pressing it for a while,
you'll start floating right back up.

00:44:17.238 --> 00:44:20.116
Press it in to go down,
leave it alone to float.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:21.909
Simple, right?

00:44:21.993 --> 00:44:24.412
Wait, uh, what was what again?

00:44:25.872 --> 00:44:28.666
- Man.
- Keep your shoulders up.

00:44:28.749 --> 00:44:30.626
Why's it gotta be so heavy?

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.670
Keep going. It has to be tight.

00:44:33.379 --> 00:44:34.589
Shit.

00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:36.966
- Ah, fuck.
- There, sit. Slowly does it.

00:44:37.049 --> 00:44:39.886
- Easy, easy now.
- Damn it.

00:44:39.969 --> 00:44:41.637
Here. Tighten this too.

00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:44.849
Hey.

00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:47.852
- Try working the pump.
- Okay.

00:44:49.979 --> 00:44:52.440
Seokbae,
is the air coming through?

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:54.442
Yeah. It's working fine.

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:57.987
- Hey. You better keep going.
- Okay.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:00.114
Don't worry about it,
and just be careful.

00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:04.202
- We'll pump like crazy.
- You gotta go down slowly, all right?

00:45:05.411 --> 00:45:07.288
- I got it, okay.
- Here, tuck your head in.

00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:08.456
Tuck your head in.

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:10.666
Heard you the first time. Shit.

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:12.210
Careful, careful. Hey, careful.

00:45:12.293 --> 00:45:14.670
Keep your head tucked. Easy, easy.

00:45:14.754 --> 00:45:17.423
There. Yeah, that's good, that's good.

00:45:17.506 --> 00:45:19.383
We're turning it now.
Keep your shoulders steady.

00:45:20.676 --> 00:45:22.345
That's it. There you go!

00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:31.729
- Go on, kid.
- Careful not to get the hose tangled.

00:45:31.812 --> 00:45:33.189
- Yeah.
- You're doing great!

00:45:33.272 --> 00:45:35.524
- Fuck.
- You heard him.

00:45:37.693 --> 00:45:39.320
Ah, there he goes.

00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:57.505
Shit. I can't see a damn thing.

00:46:07.139 --> 00:46:08.474
Where is it?

00:46:23.197 --> 00:46:26.909
Oh… Damn it.

00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:04.655
How long can you stay
down there with one tank of air?

00:47:05.156 --> 00:47:06.907
- Twenty to 30 minutes.
- Huh?

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:09.577
The water's 20 meters deep here.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:12.580
On the way up,
he'll need to stop to decompress.

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:14.582
- What does that mean?
- Yeah, you're good.

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:16.042
Decompression, you see…

00:47:16.125 --> 00:47:20.463
it's stoppin' at around 5 or 6 meters
for a few minutes and waitin' there.

00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:23.632
Otherwise if you don't,
you'll get the bends and you'll die.

00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:26.969
So we actually have even less time
to work than we thought.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:30.056
That's why we've got the air hose,
so we can send two guys,

00:47:30.139 --> 00:47:32.641
but that's just as dangerous… Hey!
You need to hold that light, and tight.

00:47:32.725 --> 00:47:33.726
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:40.941 --> 00:47:41.942
All right!

00:47:51.494 --> 00:47:52.495
Hey.

00:47:54.163 --> 00:47:55.164
Beolgu.

00:47:59.126 --> 00:48:00.127
Hey.

00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.213
Hey. Hey!

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:05.091
Huh?

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.928
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:48:11.055 --> 00:48:13.265
Wait, Song,
you're really going to Mokpo?

00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:14.600
"TEMPORARILY CLOSED"

00:48:14.683 --> 00:48:16.227
Should I just sit here
and let her screw me?

00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:17.311
"ORIENTAL ART GALLERY"

00:48:17.395 --> 00:48:21.148
You saw the way she's trying to play this.
We don't stand a chance against her.

00:48:21.232 --> 00:48:22.858
No, I don't accept that.

00:48:22.942 --> 00:48:26.278
I don't want scraps, I want my share.
It's gotta be fair or nothing!

00:48:26.362 --> 00:48:28.155
That mentality isn't helping us.

00:48:28.239 --> 00:48:31.409
We should quit while we're ahead.
I think it's time we cut and run.

00:48:31.492 --> 00:48:33.619
The reason I sent those guys
down there in the first place

00:48:33.702 --> 00:48:35.162
was to hit it big, all right?

00:48:35.246 --> 00:48:36.247
Oh, yeah?

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:38.124
And how much money would you need
to hit it big?

00:48:38.207 --> 00:48:39.375
How should I know?

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.086
Why do you keep trying to drag me down?

00:48:42.169 --> 00:48:45.047
It's not that.
It's the situation we're in.

00:48:45.131 --> 00:48:47.133
Let's just go
before things get even messier.

00:48:47.216 --> 00:48:48.717
I can't do that. I have to see it.

00:48:48.801 --> 00:48:51.178
I have to see what she saw
with my own eyes.

00:48:51.262 --> 00:48:54.432
Hey, what's the point of doing that?
Let it go, already!

00:48:54.515 --> 00:48:55.683
Let go of me!

00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:05.359
Hey. What's the first rule of antiques?

00:49:05.985 --> 00:49:07.903
What are you going on about now?

00:49:07.987 --> 00:49:10.906
The first and only rule.

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.159
Whoever gets their hands on it,
it's theirs!

00:49:20.708 --> 00:49:23.502
Hoo-whee,
I knew you wouldn't last long.

00:49:23.586 --> 00:49:26.297
Wow. You're holding up better
than I thought.

00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:29.800
- Hey!
- Come on!

00:49:31.969 --> 00:49:34.263
- Damn it. Shit.
- Damn, I'm gonna puke again.

00:49:34.346 --> 00:49:37.433
Now I wanna throw my guts up!
Damn, that's gross!

00:49:39.977 --> 00:49:42.021
You guys, you guys, over here.

00:49:42.605 --> 00:49:44.607
What, what, what? What is it?

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:46.275
The hell's goin' on?

00:49:47.443 --> 00:49:48.819
Help me pull it in!

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:52.615
Something must've happened down there!

00:49:52.698 --> 00:49:53.824
Shit!

00:49:54.492 --> 00:49:55.659
- What?
- Hey!

00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:57.411
Hey! He's up! He's up!

00:49:57.495 --> 00:49:59.705
- Get the rope!
- Rope, get the rope! Throw it!

00:49:59.788 --> 00:50:01.165
- Hold on!
- Get him up!

00:50:01.248 --> 00:50:02.333
Come on, let's get him up. Hurry.

00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:03.959
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Tie it around!

00:50:04.043 --> 00:50:05.503
- What happened?
- Shit.

00:50:06.587 --> 00:50:09.757
- Hey. Wrap it under his arms, okay?
- Shit.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.551
- Okay, go!
- Pull it! Pull, pull, pull!

00:50:13.093 --> 00:50:14.887
- Here, let me help.
- Keep pulling!

00:50:16.388 --> 00:50:18.057
- Hurry!
- Pull!

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:20.226
- Hurry, come on.
- Pull up!

00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:22.895
- Pull!
- Keep going.

00:50:26.398 --> 00:50:27.483
Take this.

00:50:27.566 --> 00:50:30.194
- Oh, shit!
- Look at his eyes. He's gone.

00:50:30.778 --> 00:50:33.656
- What's wrong with his eyes?
- Shit, you gotta be kidding me.

00:50:33.739 --> 00:50:35.366
- Hey, boss. Come on, wake up.
- Shit!

00:50:35.449 --> 00:50:37.409
Let go. Stop. Stop.

00:50:37.493 --> 00:50:39.662
Did you see any ceramics, huh?

00:50:39.745 --> 00:50:41.413
Did you… Did you see the ship?

00:50:42.498 --> 00:50:43.958
- Shit.
- The bastard's completely out of it!

00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:45.626
Are you kidding me?
What the fuck's wrong with you?

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:47.711
He looks like he's about to die!

00:50:50.923 --> 00:50:52.841
{\an8}
