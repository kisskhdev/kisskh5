00:00:00.062 --> 00:00:10.863


00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:13.863
Your plan was perfect.

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:15.682
Then the look on Mr. Sevilla's face

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.267
when he saw the note on the eraser.

00:00:17.292 --> 00:00:18.292
Priceless!

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.020
We had a deal, right?

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.690
Why did it say in the GC
that Mr. Sevilla was terminated?

00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:25.692
Who the fuck are you

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.819
to boss me around
and call me dumb, huh?

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:30.739
This month, Possenti has been chosen

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.616
to represent the Teen Genius Quiz.

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:34.993
You even got a scholarship for next sem.

00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:36.248
Congrats!

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.179
How did you get in here

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.328
so effortlessly?

00:00:40.353 --> 00:00:42.730
You really think you got in
here fair and square?

00:00:43.047 --> 00:00:44.882
I’ll use the clock in our classroom.

00:00:45.203 --> 00:00:47.255
The minute hand
corresponds to the question.

00:00:47.304 --> 00:00:48.757
Just watch my right hand.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.341
I’ll move it to wherever

00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:51.968
the second hand of the clock lands.

00:00:51.993 --> 00:00:52.969
One is A,

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:53.903
two is B,

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:54.846
three is C,

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:55.905
and four is D.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.930
Got it?

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.270
What now?

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.999
I can't concentrate because of you.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:07.697
What are you guys talking about?

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.159
What just fell, Tristan?

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.914
Tristan, what’s that paper you’re holding?

00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:22.956
Is that a cheat sheet?

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:24.885
Give it to me.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:27.754
This isn’t a cheat sheet, ma’am.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:29.964
Then hand it over.

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:33.670
Hand it over, Tristan.

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:37.346
One.

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:40.641
Two.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.062
- You really won’t give it?
- Ma’am!

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:45.480
- I said hand it over!
- Ma'am!

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.399
What’s this?

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:56.950
That’s a list of addresses
of people we do laundry for.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:06.166
Tristan, seriously.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.296
You know that paper is strictly
not allowed in my exam.

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:12.465
I am very disappointed in you.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.095
I didn’t expect you’d be the one
to cause trouble in my exam.

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:27.271
Tristan!

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:28.397
What the fuck?

00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:30.023
Are you okay?

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:31.692
Tristan!

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:34.278
Tristan!

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:36.572
Tristan!

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:37.698
Tristan!

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.292
You know, thanks to him,

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:31.920
at least all of Ms. Robles’
attention went to him.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.755
Such a drama queen.

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:35.131
Says he’s distracted by Lin.

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:36.757
He even threw up.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.027
Damn it was fucking disgusting, man.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.178
Smells so bad.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.181
But to be honest,

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:46.059
okay, even if he is arrogant,

00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:48.311
I still feel bad for him.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.980
I think he's just not feeling well.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.440
I say deserve.

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.042
Why do you feel bad for him?

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.568
And I still can’t figure out
why he won’t just

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.403
admit that it was a list of his customers?

00:03:58.237 --> 00:03:59.237
Idiot.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.115
If Bank is an idiot,

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.951
what does that make you?

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.203
Idiot to the nth power?

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:26.224
The National Comission
on Education Secretary insists

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:28.226
that NCET is a major advancement

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.269
in the country's education system.

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:33.398
He believes that through NCET,

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:37.652
we can finally keep up with
other countries in terms of education.

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.364
I'm now with Mr. Vicente Ramirez

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:42.824
to give a statement.

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:43.866
Well, if...

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:48.079
The goal is for us to compete on
an international level and...

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:49.122
Dad?

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.499
...to enhance the educational quality here.

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:52.499
Did you have dinner?

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:54.501
Do you want me
to fix you a plate?

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:56.771
No need.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.743
My co-teachers and I already ate.

00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:04.637
You know what, get some rest.

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:05.655
It’s late, Lin.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.850
I’ll rest for a while then
finish the rest of my work.

00:05:13.258 --> 00:05:14.633
- Dad?
- Hmm?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.524
Sorry.

00:05:17.932 --> 00:05:18.933
I’m sorry.

00:05:20.532 --> 00:05:21.713
I doubted your decisions.

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:22.739
I get it now.

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:24.615
I really am sorry.

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:28.578
It’s nothing. It's way past us.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:31.831
I understand now as well

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.235
where you’re coming from.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.960
My mistake as your father is that

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:38.755
I should’ve asked what
you really wanted.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.172
I’m sorry.

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:41.315
It's okay.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.567
It’s really okay.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.343
Just know, if you ever need help,

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.471
I’m right here.

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:49.515
There’s no one else we can
rely on but each other.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.267
Thank you.

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:57.148
Maybe the takeaway from this is

00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:00.318
There’s really nothing wrong
with doing what you want.

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:01.485
Just,

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:03.488
what matters is making sure no one else

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.531
gets affected by your decision, okay?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.240
Mhmm.

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:08.575
Okay, Dad.

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:09.576
Alright, I’ll go get changed.

00:06:10.215 --> 00:06:11.215
Okay, Dad.

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:18.211
Uhm, I still believe
that it is essential to…

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.839
prioritize the improvement of programs and

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.884
curricula first before implementing…

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.137
more assessment like that of NCET.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.238
Because

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:31.739
it uses taxpayers’ money.

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:35.644
Hey!

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.896
What are you doing there?

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.372
Why are you the one doing that?

00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:39.771
Go back upstairs!

00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:41.901
Come on, take a break.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.653
You might throw up on that.

00:06:44.513 --> 00:06:45.613
You’re so extra, Ma.

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:47.698
You’re the one who
should be resting, remember?

00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:49.408
Wasn’t it you the doctor told

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:52.370
to avoid doing strenuous
activities for now?

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:53.871
Don’t be stubborn, Ma.

00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:55.164
Just let me do this

00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:56.833
while you’re still not fully okay.

00:06:58.042 --> 00:06:59.127
Let me be.

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:00.795
I’ll just finish this.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.257
I don’t like doing nothing.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.968
You know me,
I’m not rich or anything.

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.428
If we don’t move,
what’ll happen to me?

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:10.429
Okay, fine.

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:11.347
Then go ahead and do it.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.351
Good morning.

00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:16.853
Good day.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.724
Are you here for laundry, young lady?

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:19.855
Oh, no.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:22.941
Bank,

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:24.902
can I talk to you?

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:29.406
Please?

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:42.753
Why are you here?

00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:51.429
I just wanted to tell you that
you can have the scholarship

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:52.429
for next year.

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:54.598
Huh?

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.217
Why, don’t you want it anymore?

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:02.607
Because we won the lotto.

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:05.066
You won?

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:06.569
How much? How many tickets?

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.153
That’s a secret.

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:09.613
It’s just that,

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.033
someone might try to rob us or something.

00:08:12.783 --> 00:08:14.243
Dad doesn’t want to say anything,

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:16.060
but I know he won big.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.165
And he probably bet on a lot.

00:08:22.084 --> 00:08:25.713
So, what did your dad say about you
giving up the scholarship?

00:08:26.714 --> 00:08:28.299
Dad’s fine with it.

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:31.552
Competing is just too stressful now.

00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:34.972
And the scholarship should’ve been
yours from the start, right?

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:47.902
Why aren't you talking?

00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:50.321
Are you mad again?

00:08:53.568 --> 00:08:55.618
I was just thinking of Mama,

00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:58.496
she bets on the lotto almost every day.

00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:02.333
Sometimes she even forgets
to buy her meds because of it.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:05.127
It made me realize,

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:08.589
life really is all about
luck sometimes, huh?

00:09:12.728 --> 00:09:13.728
But,

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:15.804
thank you.

00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:29.610
I actually have a question for you.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.280
But please don’t get mad, okay?

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.450
Why do you already think I’ll get mad?

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:37.659
See?

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.496
There, you’re already mad.

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:44.625
No, I’m not mad.

00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:46.167
Why?

00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:48.838
Ah, during the exam,

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:52.800
why didn’t you just show
Ms. Robles the paper right away?

00:09:55.636 --> 00:09:58.639
I just didn’t want them to remember
our laundry business again.

00:09:59.348 --> 00:10:01.642
They used to put their
dirty uniforms in my bag

00:10:01.642 --> 00:10:02.977
for Mama to wash.

00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:06.689
I don’t really care when
they tease me and call me Banky.

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.125
But what I don’t like is

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.068
when they push it,
and drag my mom into it too.

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.782
I know there’s nothing wrong
with being a laundrywoman.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.451
It’s a decent job.

00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:22.538
But the way they say it
feels belittling sometimes,

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:24.582
and it hurts.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:27.460
It hurts me for my mom.

00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:31.297
She’s doing everything she can
to lift us out of this.

00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:34.008
We just really had a tough life.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.928
But the way they say it,

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.848
it’s like my mom isn’t
doing anything to help us rise up.

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:45.727
You know,

00:10:46.103 --> 00:10:47.730
their mom doesn’t love them.

00:10:47.952 --> 00:10:50.830
That’s why they take out
their frustrations on others.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.737
And honestly, they should be the ones
ashamed of their nasty attitudes,

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:56.530
they’re the rude ones.

00:11:00.868 --> 00:11:01.911
But you,

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:03.912
you’re kind.

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.458
So if you ever want to have laundry done,
just let me know.

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:10.878
That way I can somehow repay you
for giving up your scholarship.

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:14.840
Oh, no, it's okay—
I’d feel bad for your mom.

00:11:16.482 --> 00:11:17.482
But sure,

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:20.346
I’ll have Papa’s polo washed.

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:21.947
Make it super white, okay?

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.183
Like there's no grime left on the collar.

00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:26.434
Got it.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:30.522
You know,

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.900
you should smile more often.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:34.818
Because,

00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:36.487
it actually suits you.

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:38.363
You look cuter.

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:42.951
You know,

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:45.996
I’ve been cute even without smiling.

00:12:01.011 --> 00:12:02.011
What?

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:38.382
Here you go.

00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:40.134
To protect your wound.

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:44.846
You know,

00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:48.537
this is the first time I’ve had
a schoolmate be this kind to me.

00:12:55.654 --> 00:12:56.417
You’re…

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:57.610
you’re being too dramatic.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:01.614
Here, take this.

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:04.200
I’ll go ahead.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:05.617
Wait.

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:06.951
Let me walk with you.

00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:09.732
No. It’s fine.

00:13:10.247 --> 00:13:11.582
I can go home on my own.

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:12.999
Nope.

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:14.292
Hold on.

00:13:18.818 --> 00:13:19.818
I’ll walk you.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:22.968
Because, well,

00:13:23.552 --> 00:13:25.349
there are lots of muggers in our area.

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:27.396
And you guys just won, right?

00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:28.973
That’s risky.

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:36.189
Okay.

00:13:36.982 --> 00:13:37.982
Alright.

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:46.324
Let’s go.

00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:52.706
My dearest Don Juan.

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:54.999
Oh,

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:58.754
how my soul yearns for you.

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:03.968
And now you shall be mine.

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:08.347
And I shall be yours until the end of time.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:11.892
Fortune smiles upon me.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.020
Now I am the happiest

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.773
maiden in the kingdom of Berbania.

00:14:17.773 --> 00:14:18.773
I object!

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:20.985
And who are you?

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.364
Don Juan, have you forgotten me?

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:28.033
It is I,

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:30.911
Doña Maria.

00:14:31.453 --> 00:14:33.789
I am your one true love,

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.416
your soulmate,

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.376
your destiny.

00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:41.130
Alas, you have been bewitched.

00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:46.010
Come into my arms and
with one kiss, remember me.

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:58.272
- Congratulations, sis!
- Thank you, sis!

00:14:58.272 --> 00:14:59.440
Wow, you were amazing!

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.209
I almost didn’t recognize you.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:02.529
How did you do that?

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:06.447
You know, Lin, I wouldn't even be
here if it weren’t for you.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.736
What are you saying?

00:15:08.761 --> 00:15:10.054
I just helped you with your grades.

00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:12.786
It was your hard work and
talent that got you here.

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:15.539
- You deserve all this.
- Thanks, sis!

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:18.167
- Congratulations, you were really great!
- Thank you!

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.476
You were so good!

00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:20.753
Like seriously, so impressive...

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.771
Ah, congrats, hon!

00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:24.214
Can I get a fansign?

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:25.841
Oh, hon!

00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:26.884
Thank you!

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:28.594
You were so good earlier.

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.112
I'm so proud of you.

00:15:30.137 --> 00:15:31.155
Thank you!

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.842
But seriously, hon?

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:35.517
I kind of stuttered a bit.

00:15:35.865 --> 00:15:36.560
Sheesh!

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.728
So humble!

00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:39.730
Show Lin your crying-on-cue trick.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.428
Lin, look at this.

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:44.108
Okay.

00:16:15.015 --> 00:16:16.266
I knew it.

00:16:16.892 --> 00:16:18.060
Eye drops who?

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:19.881
How’d you even do that?

00:16:22.856 --> 00:16:23.857
See?

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:25.817
Wait.

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:27.528
Are you pinching yourself?

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.741
That’s impressive!

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:35.327
So that’s how you’re able to cry!

00:16:42.876 --> 00:16:43.961
Thank you, thank you.

00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:49.341
Hon, just ignore Claire.

00:16:50.008 --> 00:16:51.343
She’s overrated anyway.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.929
You’re way better than her, for sure.

00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:56.890
And I’m sure your time will come, sis.

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:59.627
Maybe in the next play,
you’ll get the lead role.

00:16:59.768 --> 00:17:01.395
Auditions are coming up, right?

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:04.665
I doubt it.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.817
Claire has more experience than me.

00:17:13.323 --> 00:17:14.616
But, you know,

00:17:14.616 --> 00:17:16.702
I’m really grateful because I have you guys

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.579
to support me in my theater era.

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:23.709
If only my mom was here to see this.

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.795
Hon, I'm sure she's
watching the whole time.

00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:30.923
Yeah.

00:17:31.735 --> 00:17:32.735
You did so good.

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:35.553
You did it!

00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:38.265
I’ll always be your fan babe.

00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:43.020
Hey, take a photo, you guys.

00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:00.286
Hon,

00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:01.871
is it okay now?

00:18:02.956 --> 00:18:03.956
It’s okay now, hon.

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:07.925
Dad doesn’t like me wearing makeup.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.480
He might just think I'm

00:18:09.713 --> 00:18:11.089
in a school play again.

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:15.385
You know, you’re really lucky.

00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:20.349
You can ask anything from your dad
and he will literally give it to you.

00:18:25.103 --> 00:18:27.856
My dad will give me everything
I want just to shut me up

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.526
so he doesn't have to talk to me.

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:33.946
Well, you are a drama king yourself.

00:18:37.324 --> 00:18:38.660
That’s why we’re the perfect match.

00:18:40.861 --> 00:18:41.862
Okay, last one.

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:43.538
Oh, again.

00:18:43.854 --> 00:18:44.854
How do I look?

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:47.652
Like you just came from making out.

00:18:49.419 --> 00:18:50.629
Pat, no.

00:18:51.588 --> 00:18:53.382
My dad might see us.

00:18:55.342 --> 00:18:56.718
He’s not even here.

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:59.012
Well, you know that I'm not ready.

00:19:06.151 --> 00:19:07.151
Look,

00:19:07.437 --> 00:19:10.566
you know that I just
want my first time to be special.

00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:12.860
As promised, right?

00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:15.988
We will wait until the time is right.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.617
Not like I have a choice.

00:19:22.452 --> 00:19:23.579
What did you say?

00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:25.538
Nothing.

00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:27.833
I said you’re mine.

00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:31.128
Just, don’t go back to the States, okay?

00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:34.548
As if.

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:36.800
My dad won’t even leave his business here.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.176
So I’m not going anywhere.

00:19:40.637 --> 00:19:41.597
Okay, go.

00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:42.639
Before my dad sees us.

00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:46.810
Are we just going to keep hiding, hon?

00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:52.148
Hon,

00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:54.902
I love you very much.

00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:57.738
And that’s enough for now, right?

00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:01.282
Okay.

00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:02.618
I love you too.

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:05.119
Alright.

00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:21.136
Attention, grade 11 students.

00:20:21.803 --> 00:20:25.390
You will begin your
midterm exams at exactly

00:20:25.849 --> 00:20:26.849
10 o’clock.

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:30.604
Only your pencils and erasers are allowed

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:32.898
to be inside the classroom.

00:20:34.566 --> 00:20:35.566
Understood?

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:38.486
Yes, ma’am.

00:20:42.282 --> 00:20:43.282
Lin,

00:20:44.534 --> 00:20:45.534
are you okay?

00:20:51.458 --> 00:20:52.458
Lin,

00:20:53.251 --> 00:20:55.003
don’t make it too obvious.

00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:56.379
Just stay chill.

00:20:57.381 --> 00:20:58.590
We’ve done this before.

00:20:58.757 --> 00:20:59.757
It’s just midterms.

00:21:00.817 --> 00:21:01.985
Tioseco!

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:02.903
Dizon!

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.054
Estrella!

00:21:05.013 --> 00:21:06.013
Quiet please.

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:11.770
Everyone, you will have
two hours to complete the test.

00:21:12.187 --> 00:21:13.271
No talking

00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:15.649
and absolutely

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:17.734
no cheating.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.290
Begin.

00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:50.554
I’m done, Ms. Briones.

00:23:50.554 --> 00:23:51.847
Should I just leave this here?

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.198
Answer sheet here.

00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:54.223
Questionnaire here.

00:23:59.161 --> 00:24:00.161
Excuse me.

00:24:00.438 --> 00:24:01.311
Excuse me.

00:24:01.336 --> 00:24:02.415
What’s that?

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.440
Mr. Espejo.

00:24:03.699 --> 00:24:04.699
What’s that?

00:24:15.662 --> 00:24:17.289
Do you have something in your hand?

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:26.964
What’s in your hand?

00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:34.138
Answer me.

00:24:39.978 --> 00:24:42.856
Mr. Espejo, open your hand.

00:24:52.699 --> 00:24:53.783
The other hand.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:01.558
Open it.

00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:02.684
I will count to three.

00:25:02.709 --> 00:25:03.709
One.

00:25:07.162 --> 00:25:08.162
Two.

00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:29.443
Where did you get this?

00:25:30.528 --> 00:25:31.528
Where did you get this?

00:25:32.906 --> 00:25:33.906
Espejo, answer.

00:25:39.278 --> 00:25:40.278
Look at me.

00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:42.405
Mr. Espejo, look at me!

00:25:42.707 --> 00:25:44.334
If you don't tell the truth,

00:25:44.793 --> 00:25:45.835
I have to fail you.

00:25:46.169 --> 00:25:47.212
Do you hear me?

00:25:47.629 --> 00:25:48.672
Do you hear me?

00:25:48.672 --> 00:25:49.672
Look at me!

00:25:51.792 --> 00:25:52.918
Everybody, listen up!

00:25:53.843 --> 00:25:56.137
If Mr. Espejo doesn't confess,

00:25:56.137 --> 00:25:57.514
all your classmates

00:25:57.889 --> 00:26:00.558
will retake the midterm exams!

00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:19.828
Kyle is not a client.

00:26:20.203 --> 00:26:21.203
How did that happen?

00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:24.833
There's no way he could've
cracked our signals.

00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:27.961
So how did he get the answers?

00:26:36.469 --> 00:26:37.679
Because someone leaked it.

00:26:47.564 --> 00:26:48.732
It wasn't me, bro.

00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:51.067
I paid for those answers.

00:26:51.526 --> 00:26:53.445
I'm not just gonna share it with anyone.

00:26:53.989 --> 00:26:55.323
Especially Kyle.

00:26:56.531 --> 00:26:57.824
I don't even know him that well.

00:26:58.783 --> 00:26:59.783
He's right.

00:27:00.744 --> 00:27:02.829
Varsity and Drama Club Boys don't mix.

00:27:08.543 --> 00:27:09.543
Pat,

00:27:09.836 --> 00:27:10.962
you know me.

00:27:11.212 --> 00:27:12.355
Bro, sorry.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.423
But this is serious.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.009
If we never find out who leaked the test,

00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:17.177
we're all dead.

00:27:17.177 --> 00:27:19.179
Ping, we talked to Thirdy.

00:27:19.554 --> 00:27:21.931
We know there’s guesting in the
drama club for your show.

00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:23.767
- Kyle's part of it too.
- Lin.

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:25.977
I'm just promoting the school play!

00:27:26.102 --> 00:27:27.187
What's so wrong with that?

00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:28.730
Ask Grace.

00:27:29.272 --> 00:27:30.523
I only interviewed Claire.

00:27:30.523 --> 00:27:32.525
Not her sidekicks.

00:27:36.863 --> 00:27:37.863
Yes.

00:27:38.239 --> 00:27:39.239
That is true.

00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:40.992
I'm not the one you're looking for.

00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:49.642
I'm not the one who leaked it.

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:51.002
Why so defensive?

00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:52.754
- Feeling guilty?
- No.

00:27:53.463 --> 00:27:54.356
I promise.

00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:55.423
Please believe me.

00:27:55.423 --> 00:27:56.758
- Get it together, Ponce.
- I'm innocent!

00:27:56.758 --> 00:27:58.276
No need to shout.

00:27:58.301 --> 00:27:59.928
Yell at me again and
you’ll fucking regret it.

00:27:59.928 --> 00:28:01.653
Don't gang up on me here.

00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:03.723
Yes, Kyle's my friend.

00:28:03.723 --> 00:28:05.225
I'm not gonna deny that.

00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:08.311
But please believe me.

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:10.980
Grace, Lin, please.

00:28:11.689 --> 00:28:13.090
I'm innocent.

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:15.527
Hon, just chill out. Okay?

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:17.320
Maybe we should all just

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.197
take a breather, right sis?

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.040
Lin!

00:28:21.074 --> 00:28:22.074
Lin!

00:28:23.243 --> 00:28:24.135
Lin!

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.278
We’re not done here.

00:28:32.001 --> 00:28:33.001
Lin!

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.420
Lin!

00:28:34.754 --> 00:28:35.754
Lin, wait up!

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.382
We’re not done yet!

00:28:37.924 --> 00:28:39.599
We still don't know who the leak is.

00:28:39.759 --> 00:28:42.345
I know, but I hate what’s happening.

00:28:42.345 --> 00:28:45.390
We can't get to the truth if you
keep threatening them.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.724
Well, no one’s coming clean.

00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:47.976
What do you want me to do?

00:28:47.976 --> 00:28:49.285
Speak nice to them?

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.978
It’s so frustrating.

00:28:49.978 --> 00:28:51.438
I hate being lied to!

00:28:51.771 --> 00:28:52.856
We lied too.

00:28:52.959 --> 00:28:54.336
We cheated too, remember?

00:28:58.445 --> 00:29:00.488
Look, I just need time to myself.

00:29:00.488 --> 00:29:01.531
I'm sorry.

00:29:02.365 --> 00:29:03.616
What are you gonna do?

00:29:03.825 --> 00:29:06.077
I just need to think about this on my own.

00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:07.370
I'm sorry, okay?

00:29:10.165 --> 00:29:11.165
Please.

00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:15.085
Okay.

00:29:16.379 --> 00:29:17.379
Let's just

00:29:17.797 --> 00:29:19.841
give her some space for now.

00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:26.138
Bank.

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.391
You better just come clean.

00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:31.019
For the last time,

00:29:31.644 --> 00:29:33.855
were you the one who
gave the answers to Kyle?

00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:41.404
For the last time, Miss Briones.

00:29:42.655 --> 00:29:43.781
I'm a scholar.

00:29:44.908 --> 00:29:46.868
I have never cheated in my life.

00:29:47.023 --> 00:29:48.108
And I don't need to.

00:29:49.303 --> 00:29:51.247
So don't you dare
accuse me of that.

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:54.125
Because I would never do that.

00:29:57.613 --> 00:29:58.947
I'm sorry, Bank. But...

00:29:59.616 --> 00:30:01.216
I really want to believe you

00:30:01.216 --> 00:30:02.717
but someone has to answer for this.

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:06.429
You were seated in front of Kyle.

00:30:07.388 --> 00:30:09.933
You were the first to finish the exam.

00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:13.143
Everything was correct.

00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:14.812
Everything.

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:17.440
All the answers from the cheat sheet.

00:30:20.193 --> 00:30:22.529
So if it’s not you, then who?

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.700
What?

00:31:17.083 --> 00:31:18.793
Ayo, theater kids!

00:31:19.168 --> 00:31:22.005
Audition for the next
"Wuthering Heights" is coming up

00:31:22.005 --> 00:31:24.090
in 10 minutes. Break a leg!

00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:26.843
You have nothing to lose, Kyle.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.262
Just tell me who gave you the answers.

00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:39.688
Bank.

00:31:41.649 --> 00:31:42.649
There you are.

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:44.401
Grace.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.447
I wanted to talk to Kyle.

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:49.573
Alone.

00:31:49.949 --> 00:31:51.951
Can’t you see that we’re still talking?

00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:54.578
Oh.

00:31:55.038 --> 00:31:56.456
You're not going to your audition?

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:58.290
Did you forget?

00:32:02.378 --> 00:32:04.005
Uhm, you're right.

00:32:05.006 --> 00:32:06.341
Thanks for reminding me.

00:32:14.724 --> 00:32:15.724
Sorry, me too.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:17.226
Drama club’s looking for me.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.560
Hold on.

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:21.450
This won't take long.

00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:24.583
If you don’t want this to get worse.

00:32:25.201 --> 00:32:26.202
Face me now.

00:32:29.113 --> 00:32:30.406
I’m not your enemy.

00:32:31.324 --> 00:32:33.993
But I’m the one being blamed
for giving you the answers.

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:35.619
Kyle.

00:32:35.995 --> 00:32:38.039
We both know that’s not true.

00:32:38.331 --> 00:32:39.927
What more do you want, Bank?

00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:41.950
I already failed, didn’t I?

00:32:42.251 --> 00:32:43.461
They already called my parents.

00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:45.338
I just want the truth to come out.

00:32:45.672 --> 00:32:46.756
Tell the truth.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.466
I’m just a scholar.

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:51.552
So don’t drag me into your mess.

00:32:52.679 --> 00:32:53.679
Sorry, Bank.

00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:56.567
But I’m not throwing my
friends under the bus

00:32:56.766 --> 00:32:57.934
just for you.

00:33:11.698 --> 00:33:12.698
Bank.

00:33:13.741 --> 00:33:14.741
Bank.

00:33:14.992 --> 00:33:16.511
I’ve been looking for you.

00:33:16.536 --> 00:33:17.536
Oh.

00:33:17.638 --> 00:33:18.638
Me too.

00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:19.663
Let’s talk first.

00:33:20.873 --> 00:33:21.891
This won’t take long, Lin.

00:33:21.916 --> 00:33:24.836
Weren’t we the only top scorers
in the midterms exam?

00:33:25.378 --> 00:33:26.754
We didn’t need to cheat.

00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:29.592
And we definitely won't
give out answers, right?

00:33:29.632 --> 00:33:30.632
Right.

00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:32.260
Here’s the seat plan.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:34.153
This is me,

00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:36.013
Kyle sits behind me,

00:33:36.013 --> 00:33:37.890
then you’re in front of me.

00:33:38.458 --> 00:33:39.458
Okay.

00:33:40.017 --> 00:33:42.145
But why is Grace’s name here?

00:33:42.478 --> 00:33:43.896
What does she have to do with this?

00:33:45.481 --> 00:33:46.481
Sorry, Lin.

00:33:47.108 --> 00:33:49.527
You might not like what you’re
about to hear but

00:33:50.611 --> 00:33:52.363
I have a hunch that Grace

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:54.123
was the one who gave Kyle the answers.

00:33:59.662 --> 00:34:00.662
Lin?

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:03.040
There’s a hole in your logic.

00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:05.167
Okay, here.

00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:07.420
Let’s say the cheat sheet came from Grace.

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:09.338
But Kyle’s too far from her.

00:34:09.672 --> 00:34:12.467
Claire and Baz were sitting between them.

00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:15.219
I’ve thought of that too.

00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:17.013
But it’s also very possible

00:34:17.013 --> 00:34:19.307
that Claire and Baz
were involved on the cheating.

00:34:21.476 --> 00:34:22.618
Come to think of it,

00:34:22.643 --> 00:34:23.936
what do they all have in common?

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.620
Drama club.

00:34:31.277 --> 00:34:32.277
Exactly.

00:34:32.612 --> 00:34:35.823
I also saw Grace talking to
Kyle in secret earlier.

00:34:35.948 --> 00:34:36.948
Grace?

00:34:37.408 --> 00:34:38.408
No way.

00:34:40.203 --> 00:34:42.388
Just because they’re all in drama club?

00:34:42.413 --> 00:34:44.165
That’s your conclusion?

00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:49.837
I'm sorry. I know it hurts hearing
your best friend might be the cheater.

00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:51.631
What did they talk about?

00:34:52.507 --> 00:34:53.966
I heard earlier

00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:55.635
that Grace was asking Kyle

00:34:55.635 --> 00:34:57.762
who gave him the answers.

00:34:58.137 --> 00:34:59.472
But what’s weird is,

00:34:59.889 --> 00:35:02.558
if she wasn’t involved,
why does she seem so interested?

00:35:02.975 --> 00:35:04.644
I know Grace better.

00:35:04.852 --> 00:35:07.271
And I’m sure she didn’t do it.

00:35:08.189 --> 00:35:09.207
Come on, Lin,

00:35:09.232 --> 00:35:10.733
let’s be objective here.

00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:13.211
I didn’t even want to get involved.

00:35:13.236 --> 00:35:14.946
I have nothing to do with this.

00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:18.783
But I’m being blamed for
something I didn’t do.

00:35:23.913 --> 00:35:25.331
I get your point.

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:28.751
It’s not fair that this
is happening to you.

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:32.505
But it’s also not fair to accuse Grace.

00:35:32.505 --> 00:35:34.257
Maybe she was just talking to Kyle

00:35:34.257 --> 00:35:35.633
because she wanted to find out

00:35:35.633 --> 00:35:36.926
who gave him the answers.

00:35:37.885 --> 00:35:38.885
You’re right.

00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:42.265
It’s also unfair to Grace if I accuse her.

00:35:45.059 --> 00:35:46.060
I'm sorry, Lin.

00:35:46.602 --> 00:35:48.246
I don’t have any proof either.

00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:49.647
The logic just made sense.

00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:53.651
Maybe just don’t tell her about this.

00:35:54.402 --> 00:35:55.402
It's okay.

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:57.487
Let it go.

00:35:58.281 --> 00:35:59.782
I'll talk to Grace.

00:36:33.566 --> 00:36:34.775
I need your help.

00:36:40.948 --> 00:36:42.258
Sis.

00:36:42.283 --> 00:36:43.287
What's wrong?

00:36:43.312 --> 00:36:44.647
What did you want to talk about?

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:47.914
I still can’t believe it.

00:36:47.914 --> 00:36:49.290
But it’s just so hard.

00:36:50.124 --> 00:36:52.268
But I think you gave the answers to Kyle.

00:36:52.293 --> 00:36:54.045
You made the cheat sheet.

00:36:57.757 --> 00:36:59.258
You gave it to Claire.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.303
She passed it to Baz.

00:37:03.763 --> 00:37:05.306
Then Baz gave it to Kyle.

00:37:06.724 --> 00:37:07.808
Am I right?

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:16.525
How could you think that of me?

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:18.945
I'm your best friend.

00:37:20.821 --> 00:37:22.490
I just want to know.

00:37:22.865 --> 00:37:24.075
Why did you do it?

00:37:24.575 --> 00:37:25.785
But I didn't do it.

00:37:26.577 --> 00:37:27.870
I didn't do it.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.640
Sis, please.

00:37:30.665 --> 00:37:32.416
You have to believe me.

00:37:34.502 --> 00:37:37.129
I want to and I trust you.

00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:40.633
But even those who had nothing
to do with it are affected.

00:37:55.924 --> 00:37:58.261
I wouldn't do that to you, sis.

00:38:04.448 --> 00:38:07.076
I wouldn't do anything to harm you.

00:38:11.497 --> 00:38:12.890
Calm down, Grace.

00:38:12.915 --> 00:38:14.041
Just take a breath.

00:38:14.542 --> 00:38:15.835
Breathe, sis.

00:38:16.419 --> 00:38:17.336
I'm so sorry.

00:38:17.336 --> 00:38:18.713
Maybe I’m wrong, okay?

00:38:18.713 --> 00:38:20.297
I believe you, sis.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.966
I'm so sorry.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.845
It's okay.

00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:27.596
It’s okay, sis.

00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:29.432
Breathe. I'm sorry.

00:38:30.224 --> 00:38:31.559
I'm sorry, Grace.

00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:33.769
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:38:35.745 --> 00:38:36.771
Breathe.

00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:38.648
I'm sorry.

00:38:45.614 --> 00:38:47.590
Look at you, you're such a crybaby.

00:39:03.744 --> 00:39:04.744
Hon?

00:39:13.809 --> 00:39:14.810
Hey, Tony boy.

00:39:16.145 --> 00:39:19.148
Tell them what you told me earlier, okay?

00:39:24.278 --> 00:39:25.278
Guys.

00:39:27.632 --> 00:39:29.134
The cheat sheet came from me.

00:39:30.242 --> 00:39:31.520
I was the one who leaked it.

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:39.960
I told Kyle that you
were giving out answers.

00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:42.546
So he asked me for help.

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:45.132
Then he pulled in Claire and Baz.

00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:49.303
I knew we couldn't
trust you, you little bitch.

00:39:52.473 --> 00:39:53.473
Tony.

00:39:56.393 --> 00:39:57.686
When we asked you,

00:39:58.444 --> 00:39:59.444
you denied it.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.190
Why the change of heart?

00:40:04.276 --> 00:40:05.319
Well, it’s because...

00:40:06.362 --> 00:40:07.421
Because, Lin,

00:40:07.446 --> 00:40:10.157
I knew you’d all figure
out the truth anyway.

00:40:12.535 --> 00:40:13.636
Also, Lin,

00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:14.870
I’m just tired.

00:40:15.538 --> 00:40:17.498
I didn’t want to lie to you anymore.

00:40:17.523 --> 00:40:18.524
Oh, really?

00:40:19.166 --> 00:40:20.101
Did you know?

00:40:20.126 --> 00:40:21.919
Your guilt means nothing now.

00:40:22.211 --> 00:40:24.672
Even Bank, who had nothing
to do with it, got blamed.

00:40:24.672 --> 00:40:27.049
You should be the one
held accountable, not him.

00:40:27.424 --> 00:40:28.424
Lin.

00:40:29.677 --> 00:40:31.971
It won’t happen again, I swear.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.480
Fine.

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:38.435
Then tell Miss Briones
you made the cheat sheet.

00:40:38.644 --> 00:40:39.770
Tell her that

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:42.439
you got the questionnaire
before the exam started.

00:40:42.815 --> 00:40:44.275
Wait, Lin.

00:40:44.859 --> 00:40:47.236
I think you should just
think this through first.

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.238
I don't think that's a good idea.

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.031
I agree, Lin.

00:40:51.632 --> 00:40:54.326
I know we should teach
this idiot a lesson, but

00:40:55.452 --> 00:40:56.620
snitching ain't it.

00:40:57.746 --> 00:40:59.290
Everyone’s moving on already.

00:41:00.916 --> 00:41:02.734
Yeah. Pat is right.

00:41:02.918 --> 00:41:05.629
If they question Baz and Kyle

00:41:08.382 --> 00:41:11.260
and even Claire, then they'll

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:12.469
tell on us too.

00:41:12.469 --> 00:41:13.237
Probably.

00:41:13.262 --> 00:41:14.572
You know, it was...

00:41:14.597 --> 00:41:16.866
it was really suspicious on your end.

00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:19.101
You know, how did you
find out that it was Tony?

00:41:23.991 --> 00:41:24.991
Right?

00:41:26.692 --> 00:41:28.027
Okay, Lin.

00:41:28.052 --> 00:41:29.052
Look.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:30.988
I spoke to Kyle.

00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:34.867
He's the only one who got
an 'F' on midterms.

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.873
All of us and even Bank,

00:41:39.038 --> 00:41:40.247
we are safe.

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:42.290
We're safe.

00:41:45.419 --> 00:41:46.419
Yeah?

00:41:49.215 --> 00:41:50.215
Alright.

00:41:51.634 --> 00:41:52.634
But Tony,

00:41:54.053 --> 00:41:55.429
if this issue comes back,

00:41:56.513 --> 00:41:57.681
you better own up to it.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.441
First of all,

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.361
I just want to thank all the auditionees.

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:12.858
Give yourselves a round of applause.

00:42:18.327 --> 00:42:20.746
I am so excited to announce to you
our production's rendition of

00:42:20.746 --> 00:42:23.249
Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë.

00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:25.030
Without further ado,

00:42:26.168 --> 00:42:27.168
let’s do it!

00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:29.647
Don't worry, hon.

00:42:29.672 --> 00:42:31.298
I know you'll get the lead role.

00:42:32.341 --> 00:42:35.261
For the role of Catherine Earnshaw,

00:42:35.761 --> 00:42:38.639
who do you think is our sad girl lead?

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.517
Let's hear a drumroll, guys!

00:42:46.605 --> 00:42:48.274
Congratulations,

00:42:51.277 --> 00:42:52.820
Claire O'Reilly.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:54.780
Oh, it's me.

00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.576
Are you serious? Her?

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.287
This is bullshit.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:03.838
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Baz.

00:43:07.459 --> 00:43:08.459
Hon,

00:43:08.711 --> 00:43:10.546
I'm sure you're gonna get another role.

00:43:11.505 --> 00:43:12.505
It's okay.

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:19.305
But it's not the lead role.

00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:22.141
Up next,

00:43:22.998 --> 00:43:25.459
playing the role of Ellen "Nelly" Dean,

00:43:26.186 --> 00:43:27.896
our narrator will be

00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:32.568
Grace Dizon.

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:35.446
I told you. You got this.

00:43:37.031 --> 00:43:38.031
Congrats, hon.

00:43:45.497 --> 00:43:46.497
Good luck.

00:43:46.749 --> 00:43:47.749
Congratulations.

00:43:53.088 --> 00:43:54.088
Claire!

00:43:57.343 --> 00:43:59.136
We had a deal, right?

00:43:59.636 --> 00:44:01.180
If I gave you the test answers,

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.516
you said that you won’t audition
for the lead role.

00:44:06.643 --> 00:44:07.853
Here’s the thing.

00:44:09.015 --> 00:44:10.767
You offered first, Grace.

00:44:11.523 --> 00:44:13.400
You didn’t even give me a choice.

00:44:14.276 --> 00:44:15.444
You just thought we had a deal,

00:44:15.444 --> 00:44:17.071
but did you ever hear me say yes?

00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:19.823
You liar!

00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:22.701
And to make things worse,

00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:25.871
you shared it,
you passed it with other people!

00:44:26.997 --> 00:44:28.665
That was just for you, Claire.

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:30.209
Just for you.

00:44:30.584 --> 00:44:32.311
That was not part of the deal.

00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:34.254
How could you do this to me?

00:44:34.279 --> 00:44:35.572
They’re my friends.

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:38.592
So what's it to you
if I helped them out?

00:44:39.635 --> 00:44:40.637
Also,

00:44:41.053 --> 00:44:42.930
I didn’t ask for the lead role.

00:44:43.806 --> 00:44:45.057
Baz gave it to me.

00:44:45.724 --> 00:44:46.724
So if,

00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:48.012
you have a problem with that,

00:44:50.582 --> 00:44:51.730
just accept it.

00:44:52.564 --> 00:44:53.690
Stop being so bitter.

00:44:55.275 --> 00:44:56.360
You traitor!

00:44:57.637 --> 00:44:58.637
Really?

00:44:59.279 --> 00:45:00.989
That’s coming from you?

00:45:01.573 --> 00:45:03.158
Don’t you feel bad for Lin?

00:45:04.172 --> 00:45:05.177
Or Pat?

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:06.412
Your boyfriend?

00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:10.499
You lied to them just to get the lead part?

00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:12.876
So if there's a traitor here,

00:45:13.752 --> 00:45:15.379
it's you, Grace.

00:45:57.963 --> 00:45:58.963
Grace, what was that?

00:45:59.923 --> 00:46:00.966
What was that?

00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:02.634
Just come here.

00:46:02.634 --> 00:46:03.844
Can you talk to me?

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:06.763
Grace, what’s wrong?

00:46:07.222 --> 00:46:08.222
I need your help.

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.533
Huh?

00:46:09.573 --> 00:46:10.741
What happened?

00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:12.185
Did you do something?

00:46:14.396 --> 00:46:15.396
Grace?

00:46:22.946 --> 00:46:24.072
Hey, Grace!

00:46:28.076 --> 00:46:29.369
I need your help.

00:46:30.746 --> 00:46:31.997
Why, what happened?

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:33.548
Did you do something?

00:46:39.922 --> 00:46:40.922
Grace?

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:45.886
The cheat sheet came from me.

00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:48.679
What?

00:46:50.127 --> 00:46:51.211
I know.

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:53.352
And I'm so sorry.

00:46:57.397 --> 00:46:59.024
Why did you do it?

00:47:04.071 --> 00:47:06.740
I just wanted to pass it to Claire.

00:47:07.074 --> 00:47:08.408
Just to her.

00:47:08.408 --> 00:47:09.952
But then she shared it with the other

00:47:09.952 --> 00:47:12.371
drama club members including Kyle.

00:47:17.709 --> 00:47:20.379
And I just wanted to get the lead part.

00:47:22.798 --> 00:47:24.675
I just wanted the lead part.

00:47:24.883 --> 00:47:29.513
If I give Claire the answers,
then she won't audition.

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:31.765
And it is the only way.

00:47:40.857 --> 00:47:41.857
Tony,

00:47:44.486 --> 00:47:46.905
don't tell anyone, please.

00:47:47.906 --> 00:47:49.700
I can't tell Lin and not even Pat.

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.243
They would not forgive me.

00:47:52.327 --> 00:47:54.037
You need to help me.

00:47:54.788 --> 00:47:55.789
Please.

00:47:57.367 --> 00:47:58.374
Fine.

00:47:59.418 --> 00:48:00.794
What do I have to do?

00:48:07.423 --> 00:48:09.890
I need you to admit to Lin and Pat

00:48:10.804 --> 00:48:13.223
that you gave Kyle the answers.

00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:14.599
What?

00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:16.518
That's hard, Grace.

00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:18.770
Tony, please.

00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:22.583
Please, I'll make sure that they
won't tell any of our parents

00:48:22.608 --> 00:48:23.734
or our teachers.

00:48:23.759 --> 00:48:25.386
The worst that could happen is that

00:48:25.411 --> 00:48:27.195
they’ll just get mad at you.

00:48:27.632 --> 00:48:29.197
But once this is all done,

00:48:30.157 --> 00:48:31.241
they'll forget about it.

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:34.077
And Pat and Lin, they won't
do anything to you either

00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:36.079
because that would implicate them too.

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:40.208
Tony, please.

00:48:43.003 --> 00:48:44.003
Please.

00:48:49.473 --> 00:48:50.473
Before,

00:48:52.012 --> 00:48:53.639
you just kept avoiding me.

00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:58.602
No matter how hard I tried
to get close to you,

00:48:59.227 --> 00:49:00.562
you push me away.

00:49:08.278 --> 00:49:09.278
But,

00:49:09.655 --> 00:49:11.198
I love Pat.

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:17.579
Then go ask him for help.

00:49:18.538 --> 00:49:19.748
What do you take me for?

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:21.375
Wait.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.584
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:49:22.584 --> 00:49:23.251
Tony.

00:49:23.251 --> 00:49:24.252
Tony, please, please.

00:49:24.252 --> 00:49:25.629
I'll do anything that you want.

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:27.506
Please, I just, I need you to help me.

00:49:27.506 --> 00:49:28.256
I'm begging you.

00:49:28.256 --> 00:49:29.549
Please.

00:49:30.497 --> 00:49:31.310
Please.

00:49:31.343 --> 00:49:32.343
Please help me.

00:49:47.025 --> 00:49:48.694
I just want one thing.

00:50:00.401 --> 00:50:02.833
We need to start looking for clients now.

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:04.916
Can you handle that, Pat?

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.210
What?

00:50:06.235 --> 00:50:07.862
Happy anniversary, hon.

00:50:07.968 --> 00:50:09.428
Hon, I'm ready.

00:50:10.778 --> 00:50:12.363
Sir, I’ll go pick up my girlfriend

00:50:12.527 --> 00:50:15.154
She was just here earlier,
but isn’t answering.

00:50:15.179 --> 00:50:16.440
The, uh, audition?

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.014
Sir, what audition?

00:50:18.039 --> 00:50:19.975
There’s no audition happening here.

00:50:19.975 --> 00:50:21.996
- Oh, here are your copies.
- Alright.

00:50:22.021 --> 00:50:24.517
- Let’s just meet at the library first.
- Sure, game.

00:50:24.542 --> 00:50:26.350
Perfect timing,
I was gonna tell you something.

00:50:26.375 --> 00:50:27.899
- What is it?
- I like you.

00:50:27.924 --> 00:50:29.276
Did she send a code?

00:50:29.276 --> 00:50:30.402
Miss Briones, I think there’s

00:50:30.402 --> 00:50:32.487
something wrong with the speakers.
