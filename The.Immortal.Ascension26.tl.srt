Ang babaeng iyon at anak

71
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,010
aren't yours either.

72
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,410
Kaya, tatanungin kita ulit.

Kilala mo ako?

75
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,160
To be honest with you,

76
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,540
Nakalimutan ko na ang lahat

77
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,610

78
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,450

or why I am here.

80

81
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,540

82
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,890

88

91
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,490

94
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,660
Ang pangalan ko ay Zhang Tie?

95
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,020
You really aren't Zhang Tie.

96
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,610

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,100

110
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,660

111

117

pusa na nag -sneaking
sa aming pato.

119

121
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,810

122
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,020
Kaibigan siya

124
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,580
Patuloy na iginiit na ginagawa ko siyang isang bagong hanay ng mga armas.

125
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,100
I have already turned him down several times.

126
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,580
Tama yan.

127
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,460

129
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,140
Not at all.

130

Mangyaring, pumasok.

131

kami ng isang mabilis

ay papunta na ako.

- Hurry.  - magpatuloy.

138
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,170
Go inside.

139
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,250
Magsalita.

140
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,250
Who are you?

141
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,100
Kung sasabihin mo ang totoo,

142
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,900
I promise I will not harm them.

143
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,340
Ngunit kung nagsisinungaling ka,

144
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,730
well, you can try me.

145
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:34,980
Nasugatan ako

146
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,220
in a battle against an enemy.

147
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,540
Desperado ako at kinuha ang katawan na ito.

148
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,460
I had no choice.

149

Patawarin mo ako.

150
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,290
At least that sounds reasonable.

151

Zhong Wu cut ties with Spirit Beast Mountain a long time ago.

163
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,220
Hindi pa rin handa na sabihin ang totoo?

164
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,730
I will talk!

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,410
Mag -uusap ako.

166

Ang anim na demonyong sekta?

169
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,660
Yes.

170
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,290
Taon na ang nakalilipas,

171
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,220
I fought someone here

172
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,170
at malubhang nasugatan.

173
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,900
My body was destroyed,

174
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,900
at sa desperasyon,

175
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,610
I let my primordial spirit leave the body.

176
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,580
Kapag nawalan ako ng lahat ng pag -asa,

177
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,060
I found this empty vessel without a soul.

178
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,460
Ngunit

179
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,490
after entering this body,

180
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,490
my cultivation plummeted.

181
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,650
Upang maiwasan ang makapangyarihang kaaway na iyon,

182
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,100
I disguised myself as an ordinary man

183
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,100
at gumawa ng isang

184
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,420
buhay na may panday

185
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,420
in the city.

186
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,370
Sa paglipas ng panahon,

187
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,730
I got close to the townspeople,

188
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,460
At may sinubukan pa ring matchmake para sa akin.

189
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,770
Eventually,

190
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,180
Siya ay naging asawa ko, at ang

191
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,130
anak na iyon ay naging anak ko.

192
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,890
Before I knew it,

193
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,980
Limang taon na ang lumipas na ganyan.

194
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,300
You never thought

195
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,730
Tungkol sa Pagbabalik?

196
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,700
In the demonic sects, it is all survival of the fittest.

197
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,580
Ngayon na ako ay mahina,

198
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,980
if I returned,

199
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,890
Ang aking sariling kapwa miyembro ng sekta ay malamang na papatayin ako.

200
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,700
Besides,

201
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,530
Ang mga kamay na ito ay mas mahusay na angkop sa forge

202
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,820
than the battlefield.

203
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,890
Ang buhay ay mapayapa ngayon.

204
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,980
Why would I want to go back to a world of endless killing?

205
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,010
Mapayapa?

206
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,650
The demonic sects have already taken over the eastern region of Yue Kingdom.

207
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,700
Gaano katagal sa tingin mo

208
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,770
Ang kapayapaan na ito ay tatagal?

209
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,890
Already?

210
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,060
Hindi iyon maaaring.  It is far too soon.

211
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,610
Hindi ka isang ordinaryong demonyong magsasaka.

212
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,580
Tell me.

213
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,060
Sino ka talaga?

214
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,730
No matter who I used to be,

215
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,980
that part of me is gone now.

216
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,460
Bakit pindutin ako para sa mga sagot?

217
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,490
Take my advice.

218
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,530
Mawawala ang pitong sekta.

219
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,060
Make your move early.

220
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,130
Huwag mawala ang iyong buhay nang walang kabuluhan.

221
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,220
This man knows more than he is letting on.

222
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,130
Kailangan kong mag -pry ng karagdagang impormasyon sa kanya.

223
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,490
Right now, the battle is at a stalemate.

224
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,730
Ang pitong sekta ay nagkakaisa laban sa mga demonyong sekta,

225
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,010
but talk of victory or defeat

226
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,420
Mukhang isang maliit na napaaga.

227
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,180
There's a long and bitter history between the Seven Sects

228
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,940
at ang anim na demonyong sekta.

229
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,580
Cultivators are innately selfish.

230
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,010
Ang backstabbing ay walang bago.

231
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,370
The so-called impenetrable alliance of the Seven Sects

232
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,820
ay lubusang na

233
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,250
-infiltrate sa amin.

234
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,010
In fact,

235
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,100
Espiritu ng hayop na bundok

236
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,100
is the Beast Taming Sect's spy here.

237
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,220
Ang anim na demonyong sekta

238
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,730
will win this battle.

239
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,490
Nagpapanggap ang Espiritu ng Hayop na Bundok na may depekto,

240
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,340
then wiped out two Core Formation Stage cultivators from the demonic sects.

241
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,010
Alam ng lahat sa pitong sekta ang kwentong iyon.

242
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,650
This whole "spy" thing

243
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,460
ay kasinungalingan lamang upang lokohin ang ignorante.

244
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,490
Kung wala ang mga pangunahing tagapagtaguyod ng pagbuo na "namamatay,"

245
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,770
would the Seven Sects have so easily trusted us?

246
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,730
Bukod sa,

247
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,190
do you genuinely
believe the ones who died

248
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,520
were actually Core
Formation cultivators?

249
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,850
Sa pagkakaalam ko,

250
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,060
the Six Demonic Sects have

251
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,250
Hindi bababa sa tatlong lihim na
pamamaraan na malakas na mapalakas

252
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,850
ang isang nagtatanim ng
pagtatatag ng pundasyon na lilitaw

253
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,060
as a Core Formation one.

254
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,610
Ang epekto ay hindi magtatagal,

255
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,420
but long enough to deceive your people.

256
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,010
Bigyan mo ako ng isang dahilan na hindi ka papatayin.

257
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,180
If you spare me,

258
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,250
Sasabihin ko sa iyo kung saan ako nagtatago.

259
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,650
All the artifacts and gems there

260
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,820
magiging iyo.

261
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,650
They are of no use

262
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,580
sa katawan na ito

263
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,010
anyway.

264
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,420
Inaasahan mong maniwala ako sa iyong kabutihang -loob?

265
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,610
You are calculating, that is for sure.

266
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,460
Fine.

267
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,300
Given how things have turned out,

268
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,490
Ibibigay ko ang mga artifact at hiyas

269
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,300
as well as the jade slips and letters

270
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,300
Iyon ang detalyeng pakikitungo ng aking sekta

271
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,220
with Spirit Beast Mountain.

272
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,370
Kung ang nahanap

273
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,490
mo ay hindi sapat,

274
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,340
go ahead and kill me right here.

275
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,100
Hindi ako magrereklamo.

276
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,060
But please,

277
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,180
ekstrang asawa ko at anak na babae.

278
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,460
They are mere mortals.

279
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,010
Wala silang nagawa.

280
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,060
Something about this feels off.

281
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,220
Mas mahusay na maging maingat.

282
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,060
Where can I find the items?

283
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,650
Dito mismo.

284
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,650
Kung hindi ka kumbinsido,

285
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,610
I will go with you.

286
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,820
Parang walang tiyaga ka.

287
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,220
You will have to wait right here until I get back.

288
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,530
Ang nasabing isang bitag na bitag.

289
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,890
You think too little of me.

290
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:53,980
Pumunta ka na

291
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,820
What's…

292
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,770
Mabilis ito.

293
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,650
It even blocked off my escape.

294
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,340
[Goldenback Demon Mantis]

295
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,900
What kind of demon beast is this?

296
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,090
Lumipad pa ito.

297
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,620
Even if it is not Level 5,

298
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,860
Ito ay hindi bababa sa antas ng rurok 4.

299
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,570
That is enough to hold its own against a Core Formation cultivator.

300
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,660
Ang mga blades ng aking ina-anak!

301
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,620
This loss

302
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,660
Malalim ang pagputol.

303
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,570
If this keeps up,

304
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,140
Ilang oras lang bago ako mahuli.

305
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,810
This better work.

306
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,460
Iyon ay masyadong malapit.

307
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,250
I nearly lost my life back there.

308
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,620
Ang lugar na ito ay hindi malayo sa lungsod ng Jiayuan.

309
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,290
A demon beast that strong

310
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,980
Hindi maaaring maging ligaw.

311
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,010
It probably belongs

312
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,940
sa taong iyon mula sa sekta ng hayop na hayop.

313
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,700
No Foundation Establishment cultivator

314
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,380
maaaring makontrol ang isang nilalang na tulad nito.

315
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,660
Could that guy

316
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,010
ay naging isang pangunahing tagatanim ng pagbuo?

317
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,620
Curses.

318
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,660
Ang pouch ay pinanganib ko ang lahat upang makuha

319
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,010
is empty.

320
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,220
Sige.

321
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,220
So you set me up.

322
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,220
Huwag mo akong sisihin sa susunod na mangyayari.

323
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,900
You are still alive.

324
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,050
Ang tableta na iyon ay may kakaibang epekto.

325
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,490
It pushed his power straight up to Mid Foundation Stage.

326
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,730
Dugo ng Dugo ng Dugo!

327
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,490
The Verdant Sword.

328
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,900
Iyon ay isang artifact na yugto ng pagbuo.

329
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:50,940
A Spirit Companion,

330
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,050
Isang artifact na yugto ng pagbuo ng pangunahing,

331
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,220
and a Golden Core.

332
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,620
Ang taong ito ay tiyak na isang

333
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,220
Core Formation Stage Cultivator.

334
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,250
Even…

335
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,460
Kahit na ang Goldenback Demon Mantis ay hindi ka maaaring pumatay sa iyo.

336
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,620
Being bested by you today

337
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,290
ay walang kahiya -hiya...

338
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,490
You are indeed a Core Formation cultivator.

339
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,660
Anumang mga huling salita?

340
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,900
Father!

341
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,770
Mahal!

342
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,940
What happened to you?

343
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,090
Sila…

344
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,290
They had nothing to do with this.

345
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,220
Mangyaring…

346
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,330
Please do not harm them…

347
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,700
Ako ba ang puminsala sa kanila?

348
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,730
You should know this already.

349
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,380
Ang iyong katawan ay matarik sa madilim na aura.

350
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,250
Just being near you

351
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,140
pinatuyo ang kanilang lakas sa buhay.

352
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,730
They do not have much time left.

353
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,180
Sa palagay mo hindi ko alam iyon?

354
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,940
All the cultivation I have left

355
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,860
ay selyadong sa loob ng sirang core na ito.

356
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,900
Once they take it,

357
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,090
Ibabalik nito ang kanilang sigla

358
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,140
and extend their lives.

359
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,940
Alam mo na darating ang araw na ito.

360
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,620
Father…

361
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,220
Ginugol ko ang kalahati ng aking buhay na gumawa ng kasamaan,

362
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,140
and now the last thing I do

363
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,050
ay para sa dalawang mortal...

364
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,140
Dear…

365
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,420
Ama, mangyaring huwag mamatay.

366
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,980


367
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,900
The things I promised

368
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,250
ay nasa totoong katawan ko

369
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,290
in the cave.

370
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,380
Hindi ako nagsisinungaling.

371
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,770
The messages with Spirit Beast Mountain,

372
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,770
At ang aking token ng pagkakakilanlan,

373
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,140
will prove everything.

374
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,420
Iniwan ko ang natitira sa iyo.

375
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,090
Salamat...

376
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,090
When you wake,

377
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,730
Kalimutan ang lahat ng ito...

378
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,010
Cultivator,

379
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,620
sa iyong mundo,

380
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,620
what is genuine

381
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,490
At ano ang huwad?

382
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,730
Now,

383
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,330
Panahon na upang malaman kung paano mahawakan ang hayop na demonyo.

384
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,620
The Five Phases Reversing Array

385
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,570
ay hindi ako pinabayaan.

386
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,250
This has to be the remains of that Beast Taming Sect cultivator.

387
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,900
May mga sugat tulad ng mga iyon,

388
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,490
it is no surprise he didn't even have time to retrieve his mystic pouch.

389
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,460
Ito ay isang espiritu ng hayop na hayop na itlog.

390
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,180
These insects are unbelievably tough.

391
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,330
Ang sekta ng hayop

392
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,050
does have some skill.

393
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,010
"Compendium ng Mystical Insect."

394
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,490
Blood Jade Spider,

395
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,900
ranggo ng 108.

396
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,980
Goldenback Demon Mantis, ranked 73.

397
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,770
Bug-devouring bug,

398
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,290
ranked 12.

399
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,620
Seryoso?

400
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,700
You are kidding.

401
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,490
Ang gintong mantis ng Goldenback na iyon

402
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,010
ranks just 73?

403
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,290
"Isang gabay sa pag -aanak at pag -uutos sa kanila."

404
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,660
Never mind.

405
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,530
Pag -aaralan ko ito kapag may oras ako.

406
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,660
Found it.

407
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,460
Pagsusulat sa pagitan ng Spirit Beast Mountain at ang sekta ng hayop na Taming.

408
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,220
Your master is dead.

409
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,940
Maaari kang magpahinga ngayon.

410
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,860
The damage you caused to my artifact

411
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,180
babayaran gamit ang iyong mga materyales.

412
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:46,980
Qu Hun,

413
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,220
Gagawin kita ng isang tamang sandata kasama nito.

414
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,700
The matter's wrapped up.

415
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,660
Panahon na upang mag -ulat pabalik.

416
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,330
No matter the outcome,

417
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,900
Nagawa ko na ang bahagi ko.

418
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,420
Si Elder Han ay tumaas sa katanyagan sa isang solong labanan.

419
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,180
I am nowhere near that level.

420
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,570
Kahit na sa stalemate
sa Golden Drum

421
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,090
Plains, pinagsama
mo pa rin ang lahat.

422
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:27,900
I respect that.

423
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,330
Sa puntong ito, ang pitong sekta

424
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,860
ay nasa gilid ng pagkawasak.

425
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,570
No one can afford to sit this out.

426
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,140
Pinapanood ang aming
mga alagad na bumagsak sa

427
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,380
larangan ng digmaan, paano
ang isang matandang tulad ko

428
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,140
just stand aside?

429
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,050
Kahit na hindi para sa aking sarili,

430
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,290
I must fight for

431
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,900
all my disciples.

432
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,700
Lahat!

433
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,660
Look who just showed up!

434
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,380
Walang magbibigay sa akin ng tamang maligayang pagdating?

435
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,900
Shameless.

436
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,010
Lumitaw ka ng huli at inaasahan

437
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,050
ang isang engrandeng pasukan?

438
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,220
I am late?

439
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,490
Humihingi ako ng paumanhin.

440
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,090
Han,

441
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,380
Kailan ka dumating?

442
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,860
Just got here myself.

443
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,660
Kita?  We are about the same.

444
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,050
Sapat na.

445
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,090
I am hungry and thirsty.

446
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,900


447
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,980
Ilabas

448
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,010
the best pastries from

449
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,140
Yellow Maple Valley.

450
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:13,810
Walang pastry,

451
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:14,980
but plenty of sand.

452
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,460
Gusto mo ng ilan?

453
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,140
Enough banter.

454
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,770
Bumaba tayo sa negosyo.

455
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,980
Take out

456
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,980
Ang iyong na -upgrade

457
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,490
Level 4 demon beast mahjong set.

458
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,050
Ang Waging War araw

459
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,330
-araw ay nakakapagod.

460
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,980
We need a way to relieve some tension.

461
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:28,940
Ngayon ay mas katulad ito.

462
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,660
Put that away.

463
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,290
Fu Yunzi,

464
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,140
stop turning up

465
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,700
just to eat and play.

466
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,860
Tinawagan ka namin dito para sa isang seryosong bagay.

467
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,250
That is right.

468
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,530
Hongfu, mangyaring magsalita.

469
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,940
Ang aming mga scout sa mga linya ng harap

470
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,660
have observed signs
that the demonic sects may

471
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,530
launch an offensive at
the start of next month.

472
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,620
Nagpaplano kami ni Huayuan na magpadala ng isang pangkat

473
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,290
to strike their rear lines.

474
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,140
Pindutin ang mga ito kung saan hindi nila ito inaasahan?

475
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,090
Hongfu,

476
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,380
Iyon ay isang napakatalino na diskarte!

477
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,010
How about we make a wager

478
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,250


479
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,250
sa kinalabasan?

480
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,700
You want to bet on this, too?

481
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,770
Ano ang pustahan mo, tagumpay o pagkabigo?

482
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,860
Success, of course.

483
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,570
At ang natitira sa atin?

484
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,420
Failure.

485
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,380
Lumabas ka rito!

486
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,380
Getting out of here…

487
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,660
Mahal na Guro,

488
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,180
this is Han Li, your disciple,

489
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,460
nagpapadala ng respeto ko.

490
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,700
I have returned

491
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,490
sa lambak upang linangin sa pag -iisa.

492
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,140
All is well within the valley.

493
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,700
Ang aking saloobin ay kasama mo

494
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,090
and you alone.

495
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,900
Ang sitwasyon sa harap ay nananatiling hindi sigurado.

496
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,490
On my journey back,

497
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,620
Natuklasan ko ang katibayan ng pagbangga

498
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,490
between Spirit Beast Mountain

499
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,810
at ang sekta ng hayop na taming.

500
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:35,940
I have submitted

501
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,530
Ang patunay na ito sa Sect Master.

502
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,900
For the sake of morale and caution,

503
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:40,980
ang sekta master

504
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,090
has chosen to keep this matter

505
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,660
hindi natukoy.

506
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,460
I fear it may affect

507
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,050
the front lines

508
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,090
At ilagay ka at ang iba pang mga mentor sa panganib.

509
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,810
Though it breaks protocol,

510
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:54,660
Napilit akong sumulat.

511
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,490


512
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,700
May you remain vigilant.

513
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,010
Nagawa ko na ang lahat ng makakaya ko mula sa malayo.

514
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,420
Master, may this message

515
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,530
Abutin ka

516
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,770
in time

517
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,860
upang maiwasan ang sakuna.

518
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,290
The great war approaches.

519
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,010
Dapat mong panatilihing ligtas din ang iyong sarili.

520
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,700
The Goldenback Demon Mantis armor…

521
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,290
ay masyadong maliit.

522
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,090
They've already hatched.

523
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,980
At kumakain sila

524
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,380
so much.

525
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,770
Akala ko

526
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,660
not all cultivators can afford to keep Spirit Companions.

527
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,180
Dapat akong makahanap ng oras

528
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,810
to visit the Herbs Garden.

529
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:20,860
Pumasok.

530
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,570
Master replied already?

531
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,090
Naaalala mo ba ang aming

532
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,460
pangako na humanga
sa mga bulaklak

533
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,900
beneath Baili Mountain?

534
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,380
Siguro maaari kang pumunta sa aking ngalan?

535
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,460
Senior Chen.

536
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,740
Noong bata pa ako,

537
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,010
my mother often brought me here

538
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,380
upang mangalap ng mga ligaw na chrysanthemums.

539
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,610
To her,

540
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,690
Walang bulaklak na mas maganda

541
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,900
than these wild chrysanthemums.

542
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,260
Ngunit pagkatapos niyang lumipas

543
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,010
a few years ago,

544
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,900
Huminto ako sa darating.

545
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:50,940
Senior,

546
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:51,940
Mangyaring tanggapin ang aking pakikiramay.

547
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,860
It is all right.

548
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,860
Sa kanya,

549
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,300
it might have been a release from the burdens she carried.

550
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,380
Siya rin ay ikinasal sa pamilyang Chen sa pamamagitan ng isang alyansa sa politika.

551
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,820
Before their wedding,

552
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,210
Siya at ang aking ama ay hindi pa nagkakilala.

553
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,820
After marriage, they treated each other with respect,

554
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,010
Ngunit alam ko

555
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,210
they never truly opened up to one another.

556
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,170
Sa tingin mo ba

557
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,900
it is unbecoming for me as a cultivator

558
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,170
Upang laging mahuli

559
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,820
in matters of love?

560
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,490
Hindi naman.

561
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,340
Sadly, you do not understand.

562
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,490
Para sa mga babaeng ipinanganak sa mga marangal na pamilya,

563
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,860
from the day we are born,

564
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,050
ang ating buhay

565
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,210
no longer belong to ourselves.

566
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,900
Nagsasanay kami araw -araw,

567
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,980
bringing benefits to our clans.

568
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,340
Siguro, marahil, 1 prodigy sa 10,000

569
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,420
might earn the trust of the Seven Sects within 100 years

570
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,010
at makuha ang karapatang pumili ng kanilang kapalaran.

571
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,570
But most of them

572
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,940
magtapos na tulad ko.

573
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,900
You are being too modest.

574
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,340
Mula nang pumasok ka sa lambak,

575
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,530
your diligence

576
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,460
at katahimikan sa lahat ng bagay

577
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,860
have surely not gone unnoticed by anyone.

578
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,010
Kahit na hindi ka isang prodigy,

579
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,610
you are well beyond

580
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,460
the average clan disciple.

581
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,610
Alam mo na hindi iyon ang sagot na nais kong marinig.

582
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,010
The reason I asked to see you today

583
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,530
ay

584
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,820
that I may soon

585
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,300
ikakasal.

586
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,780
The groom is the son of the Qi family.

587
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,940
Hindi pa kami nagkakilala,

588
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,340
but I have heard

589
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,340
Siya ay isang tao ng disenteng pagkatao.

590
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,880
War is raging across the

591
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,690
land, and no one is safe.

592
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,010
Kung ang pamilyang Chen ay
maaaring bumuo ng isang alyansa

593
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:53,900
sa kanila at makahanap ng
kanlungan mula sa kaguluhan,

594
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,420
then…

595
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,530
Noong nasa kapital na ito ng imperyal,

596
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,900
I saw Weiniang and Senior Liu together.

597
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,650
Natagpuan ko ang aking sarili na naiinggit sa kanila.

598
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,740
At least they met

599
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,420
and fell in love.

600
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,340
Kahit na sila ay pinaghiwalay ng buhay at kamatayan,

601
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:18,860
it was still better

602
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,650
kaysa sa pamumuhay ng isang buong buhay na nakulong,

603
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,610
never free,

604
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:25,900
at namamatay na may panghihinayang.

605
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,610
Why?

606
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,300
Bakit ako pipilitin
na magpakasal

607
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,940
sa isang taong
hindi ko pa nakilala?

608
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,650
Why should I be passed

609
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,050
around like some commodity,

610
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,980
Ngayon sa pamilyang LU, bukas sa pamilyang Qi?

611
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,050
Why should the fate of the entire clan

612
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,690
mailagay sa balikat ng isang solong babae?

613
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,420
No one has ever asked what I want.

614
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,210
Hindi minsan.

615
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,260
Can I lean on you, just for a moment?

616
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,610
Han,

617
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,090
I know you are different.

618
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,940
May pinaplano ka ba?

619
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,050
Can you take me away from here?

620
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,460
Dalhin mo lang ako.

621
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,410
Anywhere will do, so long…

622
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,010


623
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,340
Hangga't ito ay isang lugar kung saan maaari akong malaya.

624
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,420
I have done all of this

625
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,940
At pa

626
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,210
you still hold back.

627
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,340
Pinahihiya mo ako.

628
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,530
Do you

629
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,900
Mayroon na bang isang tao sa iyong puso?

630
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,570
Senior,

631
