WEBVTT

00:00:00.094 --> 00:00:10.170


00:00:11.794 --> 00:00:13.170
Excuse me, what's that?

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:16.741
Where did you get this?

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.284
Espejo, answer me!

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.520
It's impossible for him
to figure out our signals.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:21.871
It wasn't me, bro.

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:23.248
I'm not the one you're looking for.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:24.315
I'm not the one who leaked.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:25.650
Don't put the blame on me!

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.776
But no one’s admitting anything!

00:00:27.295 --> 00:00:28.236
What do you want me to do?

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:29.212
Speak nice to them?

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:30.422
We also lied.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:31.840
We also cheated, right?

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.865
Sorry, Lin.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.301
You might not like what
you're about to hear, but

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:38.329
I have a feeling Grace
is the one who let Kyle copy.

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:40.373
I think you gave Kyle the answers.

00:00:41.037 --> 00:00:42.580
You made the cheat sheet.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.919
You gave it to Claire,

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.379
she gave it to Baz,

00:00:46.983 --> 00:00:48.151
and Baz gave it to Kyle.

00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:49.301
Am I right?

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:51.651
Guys,

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:53.011
the cheat sheet came from me.

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:54.511
I'm the one who leaked it.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:00.685
Tony, please!

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.563
Please, I'll make sure
that they won't tell any of our

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.356
parents or teachers.

00:01:05.443 --> 00:01:07.025
The worst that could happen is

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:08.818
that they will just get mad at you.

00:01:09.318 --> 00:01:10.986
But once this is all done,

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:12.947
they’ll forget about it.

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:15.909
And Pat and Lin, they won't
do anything to you either

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.869
because that would implicate them too.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.790
Tony, please.

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:25.779
Please.

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:32.216
Before,

00:01:33.772 --> 00:01:35.315
you were just avoiding me.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.933
No matter what I did to get close to you,

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.018
you didn’t want me.

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:46.064
But I still hoped that one day,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.776
you would realize
how much I care for you.

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:53.780
And you would choose me.

00:02:04.147 --> 00:02:06.232
If I do this for you,

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:09.087
will you choose me?

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:23.851
But,

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:25.854
I love Pat.

00:02:30.553 --> 00:02:31.835
Then ask him for help.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.237
What do you think I am?

00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:36.047
Wait.

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:37.156
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:38.283
Tony, please.

00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:40.060
Please, I'll do anything that you want.

00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:41.962
Please, I just, I need you to help me.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:42.720
I’m begging you.

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:43.596
Please.

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:44.621
Please.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:45.723
Please.

00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:46.882
Please help me.

00:02:48.102 --> 00:02:49.102
Please.

00:02:54.595 --> 00:02:55.595
Anything?

00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:03.683
Yes, I promise.

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:13.693
There’s only one thing I want.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:15.171
Good thing Ms. Briones
still believes in me.

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:19.884
Maybe they’re starting to
realize I have no link to Kyle.

00:04:20.405 --> 00:04:22.699
And they don’t really
have any proof against me.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.597
And from the very beginning,

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.599
you knew I never had
any friends in drama club.

00:04:27.412 --> 00:04:30.248
Don’t think about it too much
so you don’t get stressed.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.863
What’s important is you’re cleared now.

00:04:33.652 --> 00:04:34.652
You’re right.

00:04:35.397 --> 00:04:36.815
But you know what, I heard

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:38.903
they’re going to make
the next exam stricter

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:40.279
to stop the cheating.

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:43.907
Really?

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:45.827
Honestly,

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.538
I still can’t fully understand it.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.287
How could they even stand to cheat?

00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:01.603
Maybe they have their personal reasons.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.434
I agree—we shouldn’t
tolerate cheating at all.

00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:10.893
It’s definitely wrong.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.020
But

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:16.524
maybe we shouldn’t
judge the person either.

00:05:22.708 --> 00:05:24.918
Maybe they're just trying to survive.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.077
You know, I get your point.

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:32.123
But I don't think survival is
an excuse to do something wrong.

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:34.459
Because no matter your reason,

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:35.646
if you're wrong,

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:36.918
you're wrong.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.046
Right?

00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:43.384
Looks like it’s not over yet.

00:05:43.626 --> 00:05:44.552
Hi, Lin.

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:45.445
Hi, Bank.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.987
Have a seat.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.263
That’ll be done soon.

00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:48.805
Okay.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.978
I came here today because
the school is considering you two

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:55.646
for a scholarship abroad.

00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:57.290
It’s a full scholarship.

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:59.204
And if either of you get chosen,

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:00.943
The scholarship already covers

00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:02.737
transportation and accommodation.

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.531
But of course, for a scholarship abroad,

00:06:05.627 --> 00:06:07.235
there are more requirements.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:10.912
First, you need to take
the STIC examination.

00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:14.290
You should also maintain
high academic standing

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:16.209
and most importantly,

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.835
no behavioral issues.

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:20.797
That's why we thought
of you two right away.

00:06:21.607 --> 00:06:24.109
Because I know you meet the criteria.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.594
And I know, you both can wing it.

00:06:29.226 --> 00:06:30.519
Thank you, Ms. Gonzales.

00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:32.671
- Of course, I trust you guys.
- Thank you.

00:06:36.404 --> 00:06:37.404
Thank you.

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:41.608
You know,

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:43.026
I get it now.

00:06:45.292 --> 00:06:48.628
Why Dad wanted to send me here to Possenti.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.493
It's because of this opportunity.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.204
And he knows that I want to study abroad.

00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:55.169
So you really want to study abroad?

00:06:55.463 --> 00:06:56.589
I do.

00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:58.041
How about you?

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.071
I'm still unsure about it.

00:07:02.087 --> 00:07:02.939
Why?

00:07:02.971 --> 00:07:04.931
I realized what career I want to pursue.

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:06.299
I want to be a doctor.

00:07:07.022 --> 00:07:08.022
Really?

00:07:08.281 --> 00:07:10.313
You know what, you can definitely do that.

00:07:10.338 --> 00:07:11.338
Thanks.

00:07:11.693 --> 00:07:14.279
So, why do you want to become a doctor?

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:17.770
Maybe it’s because Mom’s sick now.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.080
Also,

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.858
I’ve seen what it’s
like in public hospitals.

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.193
It’s tough when you don’t have money.

00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:27.501
And I don’t want to go through
again what happened to Dad.

00:07:28.377 --> 00:07:30.735
If you don’t mind me asking,

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.202
what happened to your dad?

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:37.331
When we were still living in
Mindoro, he got sick.

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:38.875
Colon cancer.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:42.003
Of course, he didn’t want treatment
because he didn’t want to spend.

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.796
So he hid it from Mom and me.

00:07:44.495 --> 00:07:45.481
You know,

00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:46.674
he’s just like Mom in that way.

00:07:46.674 --> 00:07:47.800
It’s frustrating.

00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:49.567
They really are couples.

00:07:50.327 --> 00:07:52.121
But eventually, he
still went to the hospital.

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.140
And in the end, he passed away

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.350
because the doctors
handling him weren’t good.

00:07:58.352 --> 00:07:59.729
But you know,

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:01.856
what really stuck with me
was the feeling of being

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:04.192
helpless to do anything for them.

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:08.028
I'm sorry.

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.531
What are you saying? It’s okay.

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.033
At least now, right?

00:08:13.497 --> 00:08:15.124
If I become a doctor here,

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.322
Mom will have her own in-house doctor.

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:20.583
She won’t have to wait in long
lines at the hospital anymore, right?

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:22.918
Yeah.

00:08:23.674 --> 00:08:24.674
How about you?

00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:27.048
Why do you want to study abroad?

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:32.094
I want to widen my knowledge
and my world.

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:33.262
It’s like—

00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:34.805
I enjoy the feeling

00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:38.809
of discovering new ideas or
experiences I know nothing about.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:40.645
Then, I study them.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:42.313
Master them.

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:44.524
So basically, you’re

00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:47.109
afraid of being a know-it-all, huh?

00:08:47.109 --> 00:08:48.778
You know, sometimes?

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:49.946
Yeah.

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:52.531
Sometimes, I just want to be

00:08:52.844 --> 00:08:54.596
oblivious to a lot of things.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.620
So I don’t overthink
everything all the time.

00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:00.665
Sometimes, I even wonder—

00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:02.261
What if,

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:03.917
What if,

00:09:04.772 --> 00:09:06.065
I'm not a top student?

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.186
Would people still expect the same from me?

00:09:09.986 --> 00:09:11.362
Or maybe eventually,

00:09:11.387 --> 00:09:13.765
we’d just become a
burden to our parents too.

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:15.136
Why?

00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:16.486
Aren’t we already?

00:09:23.382 --> 00:09:24.425
But look at this.

00:09:25.606 --> 00:09:28.876
Someday, you’ll be studying in the States.

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:29.652
Wow, look at you!

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.379
Hey, I haven’t even passed yet.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.129
Come on.

00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:35.112
I’m sure you’ll pass
the scholarship application.

00:09:35.616 --> 00:09:36.616
You of all people.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.660
But the thing is,

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:41.539
if you go abroad,
we won’t see each other.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:43.332
Hey, that’s too much.

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:45.584
The Philippines and the U.S.A. are close!

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.460
Close?

00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:49.005
How does that work?

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:50.417
There, look!

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.633
Approximately, five inches.

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:55.761
Right,

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.138
super— super close,

00:09:57.259 --> 00:09:58.260
Five inches.

00:10:00.372 --> 00:10:01.372
Right?

00:10:02.893 --> 00:10:03.893
You know,

00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:05.688
no matter what happens,

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:10.026
I'll always come back to
where I can be more helpful.

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.647
I’m short by 160K.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:52.651
I need more clients.

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:54.528
Wow, Teacher Lin.

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:56.739
Are you going to make
this a career or what?

00:10:57.505 --> 00:10:58.965
I need 16 or more clients.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.077
Think you can find them?

00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:02.285
What?

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:03.329
Chill out.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.956
Not all our classmates
are willing to pay anyway.

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:10.043
Did I say it has to be our class?

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.481
Grade 11 has 3 other sections but

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.966
we need to start finding clients now.

00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:17.968
Can you handle that, Pat?

00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:20.679
Say less.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:21.739
I got you.

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:22.764
Of course I can.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:26.518
Good.

00:11:27.728 --> 00:11:28.771
Because

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:34.985
I’ve been thinking that
after our final exams,

00:11:35.903 --> 00:11:37.530
I want to stop this.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:39.364
What?

00:11:40.157 --> 00:11:41.659
What about next semester?

00:11:43.107 --> 00:11:44.345
I don’t know.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.015
Maybe you’ll have to find someone else.

00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:49.750
One of the scholarship requirements

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.169
is a clean record and no behavioral issues.

00:11:52.868 --> 00:11:56.890
And I can’t risk people getting
caught because of what we’re doing.

00:11:58.801 --> 00:11:59.801
Chill,

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:01.470
you won’t get caught.

00:12:02.061 --> 00:12:03.061
I promise you.

00:12:08.602 --> 00:12:09.602
Sorry.

00:12:12.213 --> 00:12:14.548
You should take that—
it might be important.

00:12:15.584 --> 00:12:16.919
No, no. It’s okay.

00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:17.944
Go ahead.

00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:21.322
Look,

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:22.574
I should stop,

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:23.868
and I think we all should stop,

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.120
especially after what happened with Kyle.

00:12:27.788 --> 00:12:29.039
But it’s hard because

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:31.333
I need money to pay for next sem's tuition.

00:12:32.522 --> 00:12:35.274
Okay, so after you get
your money this semester,

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:36.922
what about next semester?

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.508
What about me and your sis during midterms

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:41.218
and finals next semester?

00:12:41.776 --> 00:12:43.110
Don’t guilt trip me.

00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:46.265
I already feel guilty about all this, okay?

00:12:47.057 --> 00:12:48.033
Look, I just—

00:12:48.058 --> 00:12:49.935
I just really need the money right now and

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:51.729
I never really wanted to do this.

00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:52.813
But I just have to...

00:12:53.397 --> 00:12:54.397
Hon!

00:12:54.982 --> 00:12:56.041
Who’s calling you?

00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:57.318
That’s been ringing for a while now.

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:58.318
Uhh.

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:00.863
No, it’s nothing.

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:07.328
It’s just drama club,
they're just delegating tasks.

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:08.996
I'll just take this really quick.

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:20.274
You know what’s weird?

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.967
I’m really good at reading people
but when it comes to

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:24.011
my own girlfriend, I can’t tell.

00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:25.054
She’s been distant.

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.264
I don’t know, man.

00:13:33.812 --> 00:13:34.980
Maybe,

00:13:35.439 --> 00:13:37.107
there’s another guy.

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:46.217
Hey, I’m just joking.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:47.576
You’re so serious.

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:48.576
Joke?

00:13:49.117 --> 00:13:50.117
Are we even close?

00:13:51.455 --> 00:13:52.623
It's not funny.

00:13:58.462 --> 00:13:59.838
So you do get jealous.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.424
I thought you were cool and all.

00:14:03.207 --> 00:14:04.121
Me?

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.361
Jealous?

00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:06.386
Never.

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.639
You know, there’s nothing
wrong with being jealous,

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:10.849
It just means that you
really do care for Grace.

00:14:11.892 --> 00:14:14.770
The other day when you comforted
her when she cried at the auditorium,

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.565
I wanted to give you a standing ovation.

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.859
I used to think you were just an asshole.

00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:23.696
Turns out you’ve actually got a heart.

00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:25.677
Wow.

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.450
Thanks for not thinking of me as an asshole

00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:32.288
'I’ve got a heart', huh.

00:14:32.663 --> 00:14:33.789
As if that’s surprising.

00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:36.981
Okay, sorry,

00:14:37.464 --> 00:14:38.465
I was wrong.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.380
But Pat,

00:14:43.309 --> 00:14:45.562
if I ever find out you hurt Grace,

00:14:47.469 --> 00:14:48.762
you’re dead to me.

00:15:33.841 --> 00:15:34.841
Oh!

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:35.909
Hon!

00:15:35.934 --> 00:15:37.978
Hon, there you are.

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:39.455
Where are you going?

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.356
I was calling you.

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:41.774
Was your phone off?

00:15:43.903 --> 00:15:45.739
I think— I think my phone died.

00:15:46.017 --> 00:15:47.017
Sorry.

00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:49.048
It's fine.

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:50.741
Looks like a lot of people
have been calling you.

00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:52.368
Don’t tell me you have another audition.

00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:54.928
No.

00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:55.953
None.

00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:57.431
Okay,

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:59.249
because I’m taking you somewhere later.

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:03.086
Huh?

00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:04.962
Where?

00:16:05.547 --> 00:16:06.548
You’ll see.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.681
You’ll see.

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:19.645
There you go.

00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:22.773
What is this?

00:16:24.274 --> 00:16:25.401
Where are we going?

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:26.694
Are you kidnapping me?

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:27.528
You’ll see.

00:16:27.528 --> 00:16:28.612
We’re almost there.

00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:30.614
Keep going straight.

00:16:33.575 --> 00:16:34.660
Turn to the right.

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:37.621
There you go.

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:40.331
Okay.

00:16:43.293 --> 00:16:45.879
Can I take my blindfold off now?

00:16:46.213 --> 00:16:47.548
I don’t like this feeling.

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:49.091
Yes, you can.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.940
It’s so beautiful.

00:17:07.234 --> 00:17:09.028
Happy anniversary, hon.

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:11.112
Oh.

00:17:11.905 --> 00:17:13.198
Oh, I’m sorry.

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:17.619
I haven't even prepared
anything as big as this.

00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:20.664
Don't worry about it.

00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:22.583
What matters is,

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:25.169
we’re together, okay?

00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:31.175
Here, we can be ourselves.

00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:33.761
No pressure from our parents,

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:35.554
school stress,

00:17:36.096 --> 00:17:37.096
judgment,

00:17:38.077 --> 00:17:39.077
problems.

00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:42.436
Just the two of us.

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:50.569
Just the two of us.

00:18:18.889 --> 00:18:19.889
Hon,

00:18:21.016 --> 00:18:22.142
is there something wrong?

00:18:27.022 --> 00:18:28.482
Nothing, nothing.

00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:32.611
I just, I appreciate everything.

00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:35.489
Are you overwhelmed?

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:39.451
Overwhelmed in a good way.

00:18:42.861 --> 00:18:44.487
I feel loved, hon.

00:18:56.176 --> 00:18:57.176
You know,

00:19:00.889 --> 00:19:03.058
if this is just a dream,

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.157
I really hope that I never have
to wake up from it.

00:19:10.961 --> 00:19:15.049
I can't help but wish that we could
just stay in this moment forever.

00:19:17.364 --> 00:19:18.907
It feels so perfect.

00:19:51.343 --> 00:19:52.343
I love you.

00:19:58.614 --> 00:19:59.865
I love you, too.

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:07.288
Hon,

00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:10.499
I’m ready.

00:20:13.746 --> 00:20:14.914
Hon, are you sure?

00:20:16.673 --> 00:20:18.216
Let’s do it. I’m ready.

00:20:19.217 --> 00:20:19.885
Are you really sure?

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:22.387
You might just be feeling
pressured by all this.

00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:26.515
I’m sure.

00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:10.226
Hon.

00:21:10.894 --> 00:21:11.937
Are you okay?

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.117
I’m sorry.

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:29.705
I’m sorry, hon.

00:21:40.882 --> 00:21:42.092
It's okay, hon.

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:53.270
Yo fam! Our exams are finally coming up,

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:56.481
So stay focused and good luck to all of us!

00:21:56.648 --> 00:22:00.360
Also, apologies for the speaker disturbance
but we're already working on it.

00:22:00.944 --> 00:22:03.113
Thank you and stay tuned

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:04.322
here with

00:22:04.948 --> 00:22:07.200
DJ Ping!

00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:10.328
Guys, can we just please focus?

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:13.039
Lin?

00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:14.624
Hey, Bank.

00:22:14.624 --> 00:22:15.624
How are you?

00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:16.876
I’m okay.

00:22:17.544 --> 00:22:18.544
Where are you headed?

00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:19.879
To you.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.885
Oh, wait— No.

00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:25.777
I mean,

00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:27.029
not really 'to you'.

00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:28.764
I’m on my way somewhere, then...

00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:31.141
I saw you, so I walked over,

00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:32.141
and...

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.532
I wanted to ask you something.

00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:35.895
What is it?

00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:41.359
Aren’t you with Pat or Grace?

00:22:41.528 --> 00:22:42.905
I don’t know, maybe they’re on a date.

00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:44.963
You know,

00:22:44.988 --> 00:22:47.115
I don’t want to be the
national third wheel.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.200
Ah.

00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:58.251
That’s all you wanted to ask?

00:22:58.752 --> 00:22:59.752
Actually, no.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.463
I have another question.

00:23:03.998 --> 00:23:04.998
Are you heading home?

00:23:06.009 --> 00:23:09.096
Actually, I was going to print
my application form,

00:23:09.141 --> 00:23:11.515
But our printer at home is broken.

00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:12.949
Then,

00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:14.601
the computer rooms are closed too.

00:23:15.602 --> 00:23:16.828
I’ll just go somewhere else.

00:23:16.853 --> 00:23:17.896
Where do you think there’s one?

00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:19.664
Oh, no.

00:23:19.689 --> 00:23:21.483
The computer shops around here are far.

00:23:21.817 --> 00:23:23.443
You still need to take a tricycle.

00:23:23.443 --> 00:23:25.102
You'll hail a ride then find a jeep.

00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:26.595
Yeah, right.

00:23:26.696 --> 00:23:27.948
Back in my old school,

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:29.908
there were printing shops everywhere.

00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:31.938
This place is just too

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.286
exclusive.

00:23:35.009 --> 00:23:36.009
You want me

00:23:36.243 --> 00:23:37.332
to print it for you instead?

00:23:37.332 --> 00:23:38.917
There’s a shop right across from us.

00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:40.079
I’m already a regular there.

00:23:41.461 --> 00:23:42.646
So you won’t have to stay out late.

00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:43.713
I’ll give it to you on Monday.

00:23:44.214 --> 00:23:45.214
Really?

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.609
Of course.

00:23:47.634 --> 00:23:48.634
For you, anything.

00:23:49.094 --> 00:23:50.428
Wow.

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:52.848
You don’t always have to do that.

00:23:55.398 --> 00:23:57.561
Well, we’re friends now, right?

00:23:58.126 --> 00:23:59.126
That’s what friends do.

00:24:00.564 --> 00:24:01.564
Okay.

00:24:06.773 --> 00:24:07.773
Hey,

00:24:08.152 --> 00:24:10.196
I see your hand has already healed.

00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:14.702
Yeah.

00:24:15.537 --> 00:24:16.537
My doctor’s really good.

00:24:17.372 --> 00:24:18.372
Who?

00:24:22.335 --> 00:24:23.335
You.

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:25.129
Doctor already?

00:24:26.006 --> 00:24:27.382
I only put a band-aid on you.

00:24:28.047 --> 00:24:30.216
You should be taking care of yourself.

00:24:33.807 --> 00:24:34.807
I’ve got this now.

00:24:35.575 --> 00:24:36.575
Thank you.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.059
Thanks, Bank.

00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:42.772
Now I don’t have to go

00:24:42.772 --> 00:24:44.357
to some printing shop outside, right?

00:24:49.946 --> 00:24:51.323
Your call has been forwarded

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:53.450
to an automatic voice message system.

00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:54.593
At the tone,

00:24:54.618 --> 00:24:56.119
please record your message.

00:24:56.888 --> 00:24:57.888
Hi, hon.

00:24:57.913 --> 00:24:59.706
I know your busy with your
audition and all.

00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:02.417
And I know you told me not to pick you up

00:25:02.591 --> 00:25:03.979
but I just miss you so much.

00:25:04.252 --> 00:25:05.252
I'll be coming over.

00:25:12.719 --> 00:25:13.803
No signal!

00:25:18.808 --> 00:25:20.018
Sir, can I help you?

00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:21.269
Ah, sir.

00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:22.812
I’m here to pick up my girlfriend.

00:25:23.535 --> 00:25:26.249
I dropped her off earlier,
but she’s not answering.

00:25:26.274 --> 00:25:27.737
The one for the audition?

00:25:27.776 --> 00:25:28.860
Sir, what audition?

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.156
The one for the softdrinks commercial?

00:25:34.991 --> 00:25:36.576
There’s no audition here, sir.

00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:38.911
Huh?

00:25:40.321 --> 00:25:41.932
But my girlfriend’s here, kuya.

00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.333
I dropped her off earlier.

00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:46.461
Sir, the office is closed right now.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.260
Uh, sorry.

00:25:53.677 --> 00:25:55.053
Hon, who's calling you?

00:25:55.345 --> 00:25:56.658
That’s been ringing for a while now.

00:25:57.013 --> 00:25:58.013
Oh!

00:25:58.056 --> 00:25:58.915
Hon!

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.067
Hon, there you are.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.355
She’s been distant.

00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:08.316
Maybe there’s another guy.

00:26:28.169 --> 00:26:29.169
Where have you been?

00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:34.509
The auditions are at the other studio.

00:26:38.054 --> 00:26:39.681
You're a bit early, Hon.

00:26:44.185 --> 00:26:45.185
Hon?

00:26:45.395 --> 00:26:46.395
Let’s go.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.279
Hey, Banky.

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:20.304
Hi, Patty.

00:27:21.097 --> 00:27:22.265
Patty your face.

00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:26.977
Lin.

00:27:27.062 --> 00:27:28.104
Hey, Bank.

00:27:28.605 --> 00:27:30.482
Oh, here are your copies.

00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:31.691
I made three of each, just in case.

00:27:31.691 --> 00:27:34.110
So if they ask for extras,
you’ll have spares.

00:27:34.444 --> 00:27:35.444
Wow!

00:27:35.904 --> 00:27:37.238
Very efficient.

00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:38.740
Thanks so much, really.

00:27:38.765 --> 00:27:39.507
Of course.

00:27:39.532 --> 00:27:40.575
And here’s your flash drive.

00:27:40.575 --> 00:27:41.482
You might forget it.

00:27:41.507 --> 00:27:42.507
Thank you.

00:27:43.085 --> 00:27:44.346
I’ll make it up to you.

00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:45.371
Promise.

00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:50.919
What if we go eat at my
favorite tapsilugan after exams?

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:52.336
My treat.

00:27:52.545 --> 00:27:53.545
Really?

00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:56.591
But what about—

00:27:57.384 --> 00:27:58.218
Pat and Grace,

00:27:58.218 --> 00:27:59.552
they’re your friends, right?

00:28:00.053 --> 00:28:01.054
Oh no, no.

00:28:01.054 --> 00:28:01.596
It’ll be just us.

00:28:01.596 --> 00:28:03.515
They’ve got somewhere else to be.

00:28:04.974 --> 00:28:09.729
Also, I know things between
you and Pat are not okay.

00:28:11.898 --> 00:28:12.898
Alright.

00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:14.776
Let’s just meet at the library first.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.044
Sure, game.

00:28:16.069 --> 00:28:18.029
Perfect, I actually have
something to tell you.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:19.530
What is it?

00:28:20.573 --> 00:28:21.573
I was going to say—

00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:22.825
Nothing, okay?

00:28:23.743 --> 00:28:24.743
Nothing.

00:28:24.744 --> 00:28:27.872
You said you had something
to tell me after exams.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.540
What is it?

00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:31.793
Why not now?

00:28:34.295 --> 00:28:35.295
Okay, fine.

00:28:35.469 --> 00:28:37.539
Let’s just do it after exams.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.509
You’re really going for the suspense, huh?

00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:40.760
Just tell me now.

00:28:41.678 --> 00:28:42.762
I said later.

00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:44.948
What!

00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:47.600
Now I’m going to be thinking
about it through the whole exams?

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:52.272
If my score drops, it’s on you.

00:28:52.688 --> 00:28:53.731
Yo fam!

00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:56.943
This is the day! Final exams are waving.

00:28:56.943 --> 00:28:58.319
God bless us all.

00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:03.908
Our speakers are still under repair,

00:29:04.112 --> 00:29:08.283
so expect to hear some unnecessary sounds.

00:29:08.455 --> 00:29:09.664
You got this!

00:29:15.044 --> 00:29:16.312
So?

00:29:16.337 --> 00:29:17.338
See you later?

00:29:17.672 --> 00:29:18.715
Let’s meet at the library.

00:29:20.583 --> 00:29:21.783
- Bye, Lin.
- Bye.

00:29:40.069 --> 00:29:41.613
Get one and pass.

00:29:42.804 --> 00:29:44.764
You're about to begin your first exam.

00:29:45.382 --> 00:29:46.800
After the cheating issue,

00:29:47.308 --> 00:29:48.643
we will be stricter.

00:29:49.135 --> 00:29:52.639
Anyone caught talking with one another
will automatically fail.

00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:56.127
When you're finished, leave
your papers on my desk.

00:29:56.127 --> 00:29:58.838
Your first exam will end strictly

00:29:59.088 --> 00:30:00.131
at 11:15.

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:06.054
You guys will be allowed a 15-minute
break before the next exam in philosophy,

00:30:06.054 --> 00:30:08.806
which begins at exactly 11:30.

00:30:12.835 --> 00:30:13.835
You may now start.

00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:18.065
You may now start.

00:32:53.048 --> 00:32:55.009
I need more clients.

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:56.808
Based on my calculations,

00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:59.811
I need a total of three
hundred thousand pesos.

00:33:00.137 --> 00:33:01.854
My earnings during midterms weren’t enough.

00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:04.148
And since this sem is the last time

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:06.150
I’ll be giving you answers.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:07.819
I still need 160,000.

00:33:08.111 --> 00:33:09.111
Lin,

00:33:09.612 --> 00:33:11.864
I see you as more than a friend.

00:33:14.575 --> 00:33:15.575
I like you.

00:33:16.285 --> 00:33:17.285
That’s tough.

00:33:17.912 --> 00:33:21.833
It’s hard to find clients willing
to pay 20,000 for finals.

00:33:21.996 --> 00:33:25.253
That’s why my fee
for finals is just 10,000.

00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:27.797
So I need at least 16 or
more clients to reach my goal.

00:33:27.797 --> 00:33:28.924
Can you do that?

00:33:28.949 --> 00:33:31.576
But I only see you as a friend, Bank.

00:33:36.514 --> 00:33:38.599
Two weeks, different sections.

00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:42.520
I think I can do it.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.688
10,000 is a fair rate.

00:33:46.649 --> 00:33:47.734
How should I do this?

00:33:47.734 --> 00:33:48.918
How should I do this?

00:33:48.943 --> 00:33:49.919
Good.

00:33:49.944 --> 00:33:51.362
Well, if I'm going to
give you more clients,

00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:52.864
how are you going to give
them the answers?

00:33:53.072 --> 00:33:55.575
We’ll be taking the exams at
the same time in different classrooms.

00:33:56.033 --> 00:33:58.161
I'll give them the answers
by taking advantage

00:33:58.161 --> 00:33:59.871
of our defective speakers.

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:03.374
Alright, I can handle this.

00:34:06.085 --> 00:34:07.312
Okay, here’s how.

00:34:07.532 --> 00:34:09.304
I’ll play four different sounds.

00:34:09.593 --> 00:34:13.681
They’ll represent A, B, C, and D.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.280
What are you playing?

00:34:15.305 --> 00:34:16.305
Piano?

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:19.182
No, it has to be less obvious.

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:21.350
That’s why the sounds I’ll use
will seem like they’re just

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.468
coming from our broken speakers.

00:34:30.777 --> 00:34:32.366
This will be the start signal.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:43.414
This is A.

00:34:59.514 --> 00:35:00.598
This is B.

00:35:14.987 --> 00:35:16.114
This is C.

00:35:33.682 --> 00:35:35.309
And this one’s D.

00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:56.678
It’s fine.

00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:58.698
There’s still a second part of the exam.

00:36:00.575 --> 00:36:02.034
I’ll gather my courage.

00:36:04.787 --> 00:36:05.830
Did she send the code?

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.124
Can you not be so loud?

00:36:08.958 --> 00:36:10.293
Yeah, she sent it.

00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:11.477
Huh?

00:36:11.502 --> 00:36:12.854
Why didn’t I hear it?

00:36:12.879 --> 00:36:14.334
I had to guess the answer!

00:36:14.463 --> 00:36:16.065
You should’ve listened carefully.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:17.675
Of course, it’s not obvious.

00:36:17.884 --> 00:36:19.326
Just remember,

00:36:19.592 --> 00:36:20.845
the bounce sound—

00:36:21.554 --> 00:36:22.889
that’s the start signal.

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:24.682
The ones after that—

00:36:25.474 --> 00:36:26.475
those are the answers.

00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:30.456
Get one and pass.

00:37:31.165 --> 00:37:32.959
We're about to begin your next exam.

00:37:33.668 --> 00:37:34.919
When you're done answering,

00:37:35.169 --> 00:37:36.879
you may leave and take your lunch break.

00:37:37.797 --> 00:37:39.257
You have 45 minutes.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.805
Time starts now.

00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:01.576
You should’ve listened carefully.

00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:03.201
If it’s the bounce sound,

00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:05.152
that’s the starting signal.

00:40:05.486 --> 00:40:06.612
The ones after that,

00:40:06.612 --> 00:40:07.826
those are the answers.

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:09.072
Code?

00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:34.473
Ah, Ms. Briones, I think

00:40:34.473 --> 00:40:36.392
there’s something wrong with the speakers.

00:40:49.238 --> 00:40:50.281
Why, what’s the problem?

00:40:52.241 --> 00:40:53.951
What I noticed was that it seems like

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:56.078
there are four sounds coming
from the speakers.

00:40:57.246 --> 00:40:58.455
And I think each one of those four

00:40:58.455 --> 00:41:00.416
corresponds to a letter in the answers.

00:41:01.667 --> 00:41:03.711
It’s not obvious at first.

00:41:04.503 --> 00:41:06.088
But if you really listen carefully.

00:41:10.342 --> 00:41:12.094
If you’re done with your exam,

00:41:12.469 --> 00:41:13.469
you may leave.

00:41:15.764 --> 00:41:16.764
Ms. Briones,

00:41:17.464 --> 00:41:19.068
please, just listen one more time.

00:41:19.476 --> 00:41:22.104
I even noted that each letter
has a different sound.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.805
A sounds like a beep.

00:41:27.693 --> 00:41:29.236
Then B sounds like feedback.

00:41:30.779 --> 00:41:32.948
C is more like a buzzer.

00:41:33.073 --> 00:41:34.700
And D has a cracking sound.

00:41:35.701 --> 00:41:36.911
What nonsense is that?

00:41:38.287 --> 00:41:39.622
Please, Ms. Briones.

00:41:40.956 --> 00:41:44.001
If you don’t stop,
I’ll mark your exam as invalid.

00:41:47.922 --> 00:41:48.922
I’m sorry, ma’am.

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:09.443
Wait, AV Room.

00:42:59.618 --> 00:43:01.495
There's someone in the speaker room
during the exams?

00:44:51.313 --> 00:44:52.313
Mr. Bangkat.

00:44:57.736 --> 00:45:00.364
Someone's using the speakers
to give out the answers.

00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:18.674
I’ll go look for the key.

00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:33.647
What a waste of money.

00:47:07.366 --> 00:47:08.492
This is serious.

00:47:08.629 --> 00:47:09.760
Bank already knows.

00:47:09.785 --> 00:47:12.162
and he even went to the
storage room with a teacher.

00:47:15.582 --> 00:47:16.767
Do you have any idea

00:47:16.792 --> 00:47:18.268
who might be behind this?

00:47:18.293 --> 00:47:19.795
Bank, talk to me please.

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.070
- Bank.
- What now?

00:47:21.153 --> 00:47:23.250
They’re taking advantage of us.

00:47:23.632 --> 00:47:25.188
Do you notice her new phone?

00:47:25.467 --> 00:47:26.635
I gave that to her.

00:47:28.262 --> 00:47:29.304
It has a tracking device.

00:47:29.304 --> 00:47:31.932
You really believe her when
she says she’s going home?

00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:33.892
Okay, let’s be rational.

00:47:34.059 --> 00:47:36.353
Maybe it’s from a
relative or family friend.

00:47:36.496 --> 00:47:38.266
I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:39.522
Grace!

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:42.125
Stop making a fool out of me.

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:44.294
Let me repeat the question.

00:47:44.319 --> 00:47:48.615
Who among you is the mastermind
behind the cheating?
