"Doctor's Mine"
(Episode 3)

00:01:24.408 --> 00:01:28.872
So... Can I kiss you?

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.704
Thank you for allowing me.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.160
Okay, if you tell me to ask first, I will.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.264
Can I date you?

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.912
I trust you.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.360
Let me know when you're ready to talk about it,
I'll always be here to listen.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.384
How could I say that?

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.192
Eat up. So you'll have energy.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.320
I'm not hungry.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.392
What's wrong? Are you sick?

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.640
Nothing, I just...

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.056
I just don't usually eat breakfast.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.936
Coffee is enough.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.256
And why are you here so early?

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.432
Why? Are you afraid I'll run away
because of what happened yesterday?

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.430
So what's the deal with you and Mud?

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.480
Did you really cheat on P'Ploy?

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.408
Just tell me so I can understand.

00:05:00.512 --> 00:05:02.510
At that moment, I really liked a guy.

00:05:03.992 --> 00:05:05.990
But I didn't date him,

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.592
I didn't even tell him I liked him.

00:05:10.896 --> 00:05:11.590
Oh!

00:05:12.992 --> 00:05:14.990
So you didn't cheat on P'Ploy then?

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.240
She probably knew I didn't love her anymore,
so she broke up with me.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.808
Then why didn't you date that guy?

00:05:26.176 --> 00:05:27.456
The one you liked.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.896
He probably wasn't ready.

00:05:35.664 --> 00:05:40.512
You think too much, If you don't tell him,
how would he know?

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.304
I'm going to class first. See you at the rehearsal.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.544
Are you okay?

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.248
I'm fine.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.880
Tum, Mild is not good today.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.616
Hey Tum!! Share some with me!

00:06:28.928 --> 00:06:30.896
Um.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.200
Come on, I'm hungry.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.168
What about mine?

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.664
Take it.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.592
Hey...

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.664
Hey, why aren't you sharing with friends?

00:06:40.696 --> 00:06:41.648
It's mine.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.224
Hey, don't play so rough.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.512
Fine.

00:06:44.544 --> 00:06:47.600
Give me more! I can't, I'm so sleepy.

00:06:47.632 --> 00:06:50.768
Put it here, so others can eat too.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.936
Mine!

00:06:52.968 --> 00:06:53.952
I'm refreshed.

00:06:54.152 --> 00:06:55.464
Mine!

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.792
You left home in such a hurry this morning.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.224
Oh! I had an early class.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.312
Are you in a hurry to meet someone?

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.744
Hey P'Mud!

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:17.280
If you wanted to know this morning
if I came to meet your friend P'Knight, then just say it directly.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.952
What friend are you talking about? He's not my friend.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.992
Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:07:24.568 --> 00:07:26.570
So, can you tell me about you and P'Knight?

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.952
Well, it...

00:07:27.984 --> 00:07:29.280
Tell me everything.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:36.816
Yeah, you already know that
we've been friends since middle school.

00:07:37.976 --> 00:07:39.980
Then in 11th grade, he started dating Ploy.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.656
Huh! So why did you steal his girlfriend?

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.840
At that time, Ploy came to me crying.

00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:48.784
She said that Knight cheated on her and liked another guy.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.520
But I didn't know who it was.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.984
Ploy just told me that Knight really liked that person.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.824
And then...

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.920
I saw she was really sad.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.464
And... I secretly liked her too.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.320
So when we were alone, it just…

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.472
You probably know how it goes.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.440
But then Knight caught us.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.760
Then why did you do it?

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.496
But they are about to break up anyway.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.408
You're really bad,

00:08:18.992 --> 00:08:20.990
no wonder he's mad at you.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.648
Yeah, I feel bad too.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.160
But you should stop getting involved with Knight.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.928
So he and I can just be done with each other.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.656
But I want to trust him.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.610
Hey Mild!

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.720
And I want you to trust me too.

00:08:45.152 --> 00:08:47.150
Hey, anyone want coffee?

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.552
I'll take a cold Americano, less sweet.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.008
You're not drinking latte anymore?

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.248
I don't want to drink milk.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.688
That's why you're so short.

00:08:55.728 --> 00:08:56.472
Damn it!

00:08:56.504 --> 00:08:58.840
I'll have the same as usual. You remember, right?

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:02.800
Of course, Iced cappuccino, less sweet, changes milk to oat milk.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.600
Alright, I'm leaving! Come on.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.408
Dr. Kan.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.256
Yes?

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.904
Are you dating Nong Per from Engineering?

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.952
Oh no, nothing.

00:09:16.096 --> 00:09:19.968
I just thought the mood in this photo was nice, so I posted it.

00:09:20.936 --> 00:09:22.800
Don't be shy.

00:09:22.832 --> 00:09:26.144
N'Per reposted it with a heart emoji.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.368
I'm leaving.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.816
Damn Per.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.488
Where are you going? You still have rounds!

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.632
Yeah, Engineering.

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:34.400
Hey.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:47.376
Per!

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.008
Per!

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:58.552
What are you doing?

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.448
What am I doing?

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.208
The photo you reposted!

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.632
Oh. It's cute. Don't you like it?

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.496
Per, stop acting like you're trying to date me!

00:10:12.536 --> 00:10:13.720
Everyone's misunderstanding!

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.072
Per, what the hell are you doing?

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.752
I'm really serious about you.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.536
They're serious.

00:10:30.576 --> 00:10:34.184
Please take care of my friend's heart.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.056
Per! Per!

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.248
Hey,

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.992
what's wrong with you?

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.824
I like him.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.112
Who you like?

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.504
I like Kan.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.184
I've always liked him,

00:11:05.024 --> 00:11:07.020
but now I can't take it anymore.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.688
I'm hurt.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.872
It's okay.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.952
But I don't get it. Why can't it be me?

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.200
Why do I have to lose to that engineering kid?

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.240
Kan hasn't said anything yet.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.600
Don't imagine things.

00:11:30.624 --> 00:11:32.424
But you saw it, Great.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.420
Don't give up yet!

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:43.160
You're still important to him, you know.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.896
You think I still have a chance?

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.264
Yeah.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.800
You have to help me, Great.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.480
I always help you.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.736
Thanks.

00:12:14.616 --> 00:12:15.704
Come here.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.968
Thank you.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.880
Hey Mild, do you have rehearsal this evening?

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.408
Hey Mild!

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:40.560
Mild!

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.920
Mild!

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.440
What's he thinking about?

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.704
Mild.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.960
Oh dude!

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.896
You don't turn around for your friend,
but when P'Knight calls, you do!

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.600
I think something's weird now...

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.120
Hey! Where are you going?

00:13:00.152 --> 00:13:00.936
Mild.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.376
That's how people act when they're newly in love.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.624
You should take notes.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:14.272
So I have to deal with him like I dealt with you
when you had a new girlfriend?

00:13:15.104 --> 00:13:18.328
So sorry, that's what happens when you don't have a lover.

00:13:52.704 --> 00:13:55.064
Mild, hold on!

00:13:55.088 --> 00:13:55.864
Oh!

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.728
Ahhhh..hh.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.920
Does it hurt?

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.760
Let me go.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:05.736
Go treat your wound first.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.720
That's okay.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.536
I can do it myself.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.056
There are so many people,

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:15.960
I'm shy.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.464
Let's go, don't be naughty.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.696
When I'm not around, don't play around
until you hurt yourself, understand?

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:48.904
Hey...

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.840
I'm hungry.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.224
Want to go eat together?

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.496
Sure, how about that restaurant over there?

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:20.688
Hey...

00:15:21.696 --> 00:15:25.608
Are you brave enough?
A-a-ow, a-a-ow, are you brave enough?

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.680
Are you brave enough?
A-a-ow, a-a-ow, are you brave enough?

00:15:34.816 --> 00:15:37.864
Are you brave enough?
A-a-ow, a-a-ow, are you brave enough?

00:15:37.888 --> 00:15:39.256
Per, stop it!

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.248
I'm shy!

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.152
I won't stop.

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:46.920
If you want me to stop, then let me date you first!

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.616
No way!

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.224
Then I won't stop. I really like you.

00:15:53.176 --> 00:15:55.180
I like Dr. Kan.

00:15:57.512 --> 00:15:59.510
Per likes Dr. Kan.

00:15:59.544 --> 00:16:02.744
Per from Engineering likes Dr. Kan from 6th year med.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.056
We heard that!

00:16:09.096 --> 00:16:10.520
Woohoo!

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:12.464
Will you stop or not?

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.192
I won't stop until you agree to be my boyfriend.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.504
You already took the shop jacket
or Do I need to give you my gear too.

00:16:21.104 --> 00:16:23.936
For you to accept my love?

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.160
Hey, is that shop jacket on Instagram Per's?

00:16:27.456 --> 00:16:29.680
Whoa, that's impressive!

00:16:29.712 --> 00:16:32.968
Just accept his love. He's so sincere.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.184
I'm still not taking Gear.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:45.512
If you guys don't stop, I'll cut all the budget for faculty's play.

00:16:49.112 --> 00:16:51.110
Pretty people are often mean.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.496
Yeah, good.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.848
Is that a compliment?

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.952
Your heart's melting, right?

00:16:59.992 --> 00:17:01.936
Am I cuteeee?

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.952
Damn Per! What the hell are you doing?!

00:17:05.248 --> 00:17:05.728
Per!

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.072
Looks like Tiger Kan is losing to the engineering lion!

00:17:10.104 --> 00:17:14.568
I told you, handsome guys like Kan
might end up being someone else's wife someday.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.560
Damn Per, let me go!

00:17:18.568 --> 00:17:19.936
I won't let you go.

00:17:20.152 --> 00:17:21.680
Hugging you is so comfy.

00:17:21.704 --> 00:17:22.960
Let me hug you a bit longer.

00:17:23.152 --> 00:17:24.888
Per, let me go!

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:27.696
Kan!

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.736
Is this why you said you had someone else
and wanted to break up with me?

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:49.264
Excuse me, weren't you the one who cheated first sis?

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.744
Kan, What's he talking about?

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.680
Yes, I'm dating Per.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:06.568
I don't believe it. Kan would never like someone like this.

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.664
Really?

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.488
Is this clear enough?

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:31.528
Let's go, Per.

00:18:31.576 --> 00:18:34.136
Oh, okay, darling!

00:18:34.184 --> 00:18:39.024
I will take you all the way to bed.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.320
You're surely in trouble, when you get home, Per!

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.912
Are you really going to tease him at his house?

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.480
Look at what he's doing, so funny!

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.368
That's so bad.

00:19:01.408 --> 00:19:02.720
Why did you even record it?

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.520
Look at how he acted.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.944
It wouldn't be surprising if Dr. Kan broke up with his girlfriend.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.208
Hey Knight,

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.232
why would you curse him like that?

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:20.704
If an engineering student decides to flirt with someone,
they'll always succeed.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.888
Hey, I'm not hungry anymore.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.504
I'm going to class now.

00:19:39.256 --> 00:19:41.260
Don't run, you'll fall.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.296
What the heck? Invited me for lunch and just walk away.

00:19:51.216 --> 00:19:52.504
But he's cute.

00:19:59.984 --> 00:20:01.980
Doctor!

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.416
It's hurts, Doc!

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.968
You're taking advantage,
What just happened was more than enough.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.536
Well... we're seeing each other, darling.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.432
Oh Per! That's enough!

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:25.936
How can you treat your benefactor like this?

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.344
I even agreed to be your fling just now.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.392
Yeah, you did great.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:34.760
Thanks.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.168
I don't want “thanks”.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.552
I want something else more.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.736
Per!

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.600
Per, give me my car key!

00:21:12.608 --> 00:21:13.760
No way.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:14.752
Per!

00:21:14.768 --> 00:21:15.984
You can come get it then.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.632
Per! Give it to me, Per!

00:21:21.008 --> 00:21:21.944
Per!

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.960
If I finish eating. I'll going home.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.872
Be careful not to get hooked after you eat.

00:21:41.688 --> 00:21:42.552
No way!

00:22:02.448 --> 00:22:04.904
See? Am I Handsome, right?

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.824
You're falling for me.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.104
My bed is wide and still empty.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.272
Go sleep with the ghosts in your room.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:18.432
Don't say that. I'm scared.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.288
What are you scared of?

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.832
You never leave a bed empty.

00:22:22.864 --> 00:22:24.690
There's always someone using it.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:27.976
How do you know?

00:22:29.232 --> 00:22:30.680
The ghost in your room told me.

00:22:30.704 --> 00:22:31.980
Doctor!

00:22:42.808 --> 00:22:44.810
Did you secretly drug me?

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.704
I didn't drug you, but I put my heart into it.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:57.304
I'm going to let the ghost in your room deal with you...

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.536
I really want to date you,

00:23:04.984 --> 00:23:06.980
You're the one for me.

00:23:07.664 --> 00:23:09.880
Let the ghost in this room be my witness.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:12.328
I've never felt this way to anyone before.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.832
Can you give me a chance?

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.992
Did you feel it too?

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.536
The feelings I have for you.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.952
I feel,

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.312
I feel my eyes sting.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.912
Doctor! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. Doctor!

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:48.600
Doctor!

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.872
I'm gonna die, why are you being so dramatic?

00:24:01.888 --> 00:24:05.040
I wasn't teasing just now,

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.072
I was serious.

00:24:11.256 --> 00:24:12.400
Umm...

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.080
I know.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:18.424
Just date then.

00:24:19.264 --> 00:24:21.260
Huh? What did you say?

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.432
I'll give you a try.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:42.952
Per, you haven't washed your hands yet.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.288
Uh... later.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.272
Per, Per.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:03.936
Yes?

00:25:03.976 --> 00:25:04.776
Pot.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.616
If you want me to stop messing around,
then you should be my boyfriend.

00:25:10.928 --> 00:25:14.224
The pot you're using for the soup, it's burnt.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.520
Damn!

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:23.408
Hurry, bring that here, quickly!

00:25:34.752 --> 00:25:36.750
Hey, have you done the calculus yet?

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:37.960
I finished it last night.

00:25:37.992 --> 00:25:40.496
Damn, can I copy yours?

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.360
You ass, do it yourself!

00:25:42.392 --> 00:25:44.304
You copy me every time, idiot!

00:25:44.328 --> 00:25:45.832
Oh, you're so stingy!

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.960
Knight, Fern wants to talk to you about something.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.392
Why aren't you answering my calls?

00:25:55.408 --> 00:25:57.390
I've called you so many times.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.512
What's up?

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.200
It's about us.

00:26:02.032 --> 00:26:04.030
Are you really going to let it end like this?

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.976
There never was an "us" since the beginning.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.512
We agreed there wouldn't be any crossing the line?

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.960
I have someone I like now,

00:26:15.656 --> 00:26:17.660
so you should respect my lover.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.592
But you told me you weren't seeing anyone!

00:26:21.648 --> 00:26:24.152
If you were going to have a lover, it should be me!

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.096
Well, I have one now, and that's Mild.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.648
Oh, that second-year medical student, right?

00:26:33.576 --> 00:26:35.016
What about me then?

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:38.696
We were just friends with benefits, Fern.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.960
You told me that you were okay with this.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.632
But I'm not okay with it now.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.992
I think you should try to deal with your feelings first.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.168
Do you have any questions to ask me?

00:27:33.712 --> 00:27:36.800
Um, so...

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.584
you and P'Fern...

00:27:53.592 --> 00:27:55.590
Fern and I are just friends with benefits.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.640
We're both lonely, so we meet up.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.824
There's nothing more to it than that.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.368
So you don't really like her, right?

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.888
No, I don't like her.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.280
Never ever.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.960
The only person I like is Mild.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:30.648
But I'm still not sure how to act with your "liking" me.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.064
I need time.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.832
Okay. I'm not rushing you for an answer or anything.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.632
I'm totally up to you.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.288
Just you wanted to get to know me better. I'd be happy.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.480
Thank you.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.264
Hmm... So where's the "sincerity award"?

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.672
Here it is! I'm hungry, let's order some food.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:23.432
P'Kan, was the scene I just played okay?

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:27.848
But I feel like my charisma isn't as good as Knight's.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.960
I'm not fierce enough.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.584
I think it was okay, but you need to add a bit more intensity.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:40.128
Or maybe I should try to act more stern during the action part?

00:29:40.424 --> 00:29:45.184
Hey... I think that's good, but you should be careful, Be safe.

00:29:45.224 --> 00:29:46.432
Be careful not to get hurt.

00:29:46.456 --> 00:29:49.608
Hey, let me try a standby for you so you can see how it is.

00:29:49.648 --> 00:29:51.610
Hey, just give it a try!

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.544
Oh Ahhhh..hh.

00:29:53.576 --> 00:29:54.688
Hey, Safe!

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.968
Hey, are you alright?

00:29:57.008 --> 00:29:58.970
Hey... Carefully help him up.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.080
Hey, I think we should take him to the hospital.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:06.544
I'll take him then.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:12.608
Clam down.

00:30:14.376 --> 00:30:18.408
Damn it! And who's going to play Tybalt for me?

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:26.552
There's one person... that guy, he'll definitely do it.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.328
Who?

00:31:17.992 --> 00:31:19.104
Per!

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:23.960
Oh, did you miss me so much so you come to see me?

00:31:27.184 --> 00:31:29.936
Uh, well...

00:31:30.448 --> 00:31:31.120
Yes?

00:31:33.216 --> 00:31:35.220
Do you have some free time lately?

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:39.784
Don't tell me, are you going to try to sell me something?

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.960
Are you going to pull out a file and presentations?

00:31:43.888 --> 00:31:47.256
Are you interested in acting?

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.488
What do you mean?

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:59.288
The reason I come to see you today is to ask
if you're interested in performing in the play Romeo and Juliet.

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:02.984
My brother, who plays Tybalt, got injured.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:08.128
You must be really stressed about this?

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.840
Not at all, I'm okay.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:14.816
Then I'm not playing.

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:24.728
Per, please help me, please, please!

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.880
Beg me, and I'll play.

00:32:30.648 --> 00:32:32.650
Make it super cute.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:43.384
Per, please help me with the play, please, please!

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.600
Eh... should I agree or not?

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.432
Just a little more, little more.

00:32:50.464 --> 00:32:53.952
Make it sweet and super cute.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:03.928
Per, please help me with the stage play, please... please.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:09.080
This role really suits you, Per. Please... please.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:15.888
Don't worry, I'll do my best.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.240
You can rest assured.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.264
Thank you so much, Per.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:44.936
Is this your regular place?

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.968
Yeah... The doctors here really like eating at this restaurant.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.328
Why are you acting so strangely today?

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.112
You cooked for me and now you're even helping me out.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.768
Let me treat you back.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:04.040
Or don't you want me to?

00:34:04.088 --> 00:34:06.808
Wait, I'll take it!

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:09.992
I'm going to eat well.

00:34:10.024 --> 00:34:13.064
This is the first meal you have ever treated me.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.752
Yeah, order whatever you want,

00:34:16.088 --> 00:34:17.960
because I don't know if there'll be another time.

00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:22.504
There will be! But you have to be my boyfriend first, Doctor.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.400
Then I'll pay you every meal.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.872
Per, I'm a guy too,

00:34:31.856 --> 00:34:35.064
You don't have to take care of me or treat me like this.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:41.712
Doctor, I'm not treating you like this
because you're a woman or a man.

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.968
I like you, so I just want to take care of you, that's all.

00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:58.232
Yeah, it is.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:02.984
If you want us to get to know each other better,

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.248
Let me take care of you sometimes.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:13.968
Okay, I know you're good at taking care of others.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:21.464
So... please take care of this little heart of mine.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.808
Yeah, I get it!

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.944
Just order. What do you want to eat? Just order.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.904
Are you really not going to let me drop you off?

00:35:51.976 --> 00:35:53.624
Yeah, I can go back by myself.

00:35:53.664 --> 00:35:55.440
You can go back now. Go back safely,

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.144
and don't bail on me tomorrow.

00:35:57.168 --> 00:35:59.336
5 PM at the rehearsal room, okay!

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.848
Yes, I won't miss a chance to see you.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.968
Tell me when you've arrived.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.952
Alright, you can go home now.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:09.960
Give me a hug.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:12.432
No way, there are too many people.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.040
Per, let me go!

00:36:15.072 --> 00:36:15.896
I'm leaving now.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.168
Yeah, go ahead.

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.016
I'm leaving.

00:36:21.056 --> 00:36:21.976
Yeah.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.944
Just go ahead.

00:36:41.024 --> 00:36:42.820
New kid? Yes.

00:36:42.824 --> 00:36:43.888
It's Tybalt.

00:36:43.912 --> 00:36:44.976
P'Kan.

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:50.312
I bought some snacks

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.952
for you and your friends.

00:36:52.008 --> 00:36:53.752
Here, he bought it for you guys.

00:36:53.784 --> 00:36:54.912
Thanks a lot.

00:36:55.336 --> 00:36:56.216
Yeah.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:00.240
Is that why you're late because you went to buy snacks?

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:04.208
Oh.. I knew you'd be tired.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:06.760
I'm a doctor too, just like you.

00:37:06.984 --> 00:37:08.496
Let me get it for you.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.856
Here.

00:37:18.896 --> 00:37:20.168
Have you eaten yet?

00:37:21.144 --> 00:37:23.140
I intended to buy it for you.

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:27.024
Whoa...

00:37:27.048 --> 00:37:28.352
Hey bro.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.520
What's up? You smile sweetly at Doctor,

00:37:31.544 --> 00:37:34.672
or do you only like it when Knight pat your head?

00:37:34.696 --> 00:37:35.976
Are you gonna rehearse, Per?

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.504
Stop bothering Mild.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.104
Oh, I'm new here, you know.

00:37:41.136 --> 00:37:43.240
I need to introduce myself first.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:44.848
Come introduce yourself to me.

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:47.688
Damn it!

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:50.592
Why do I have to be Tybalt for you to kill?

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.704
Go light incense and ask Shakespeare.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.104
Hey, clam down!

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.416
Clam down!

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.936
That's Romeo, the coward of the Montagues.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.968
That's Tybalt, the scum of the Capulets!

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.336
You ass! Do you want to fight?!

00:38:30.376 --> 00:38:31.408
Yeah, I do. Do you want?

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.920
Come on!

00:38:33.936 --> 00:38:34.704
Hey.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.192
Wait.

00:38:35.208 --> 00:38:36.344
What the hell are you guys playing at?

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.936
Look at Knight! He started first! Please deal with him.

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.944
Take a look, he hit me first.

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:46.376
Hey, calm down! Aren't you friends?

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:50.584
Don't fight, okay? Please.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:53.968
Alright, I won't fight anymore.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.208
Great.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:06.104
Doctor, action scenes aren't fun.

00:39:06.312 --> 00:39:09.864
Can I rehearse a love scene with you, just the two of us?

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.000
Knight, stab him to death!

00:39:19.216 --> 00:39:21.400
Oh Doctor, why are you doing this?

00:39:21.432 --> 00:39:23.560
Doctor, wait for me!

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:25.184
Doctor!

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:27.504
Doctor!

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.112
Mild, how are you going back home?

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:53.576
Oh, I'll call P'Mud to pick me up.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.128
I'll drop you off.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.000
Hey, it's okay.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.928
You rehearsed a lot of action scenes today.
You should go home and rest.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:04.568
It's alright.

00:40:04.912 --> 00:40:06.570
We barely talked today.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.328
Let me drop you off..

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:21.120
Okay, then I'll call P' Mud first and tell him I'm going back b.

00:40:29.152 --> 00:40:30.104
So cute.

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:47.584
Hey!

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:08.648
Hello, I'll go back home by myself today, um.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.472
I'm so sleepy.

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:45.216
Does anyone want coffee?

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.232
Me! Kan, do you want some? I'll treat you.

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:53.216
That's weird. Why are you treating me?

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.968
Well, I've seen you rehearsing hard for the play lately,

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:00.760
and I heard N' Safe fell down the stairs, right?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.632
So, how's the new person?

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:08.960
Oh, you mean that Per?

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.168
It takes forever to get rehearsal each day.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.328
But it's okay.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.792
So, what's going on between you and him?

00:42:27.136 --> 00:42:29.140
Uh, well...

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.408
once I got to know him, he wasn't that bad,

00:42:34.216 --> 00:42:37.592
So I decided...

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.568
to let him date me.

00:42:49.136 --> 00:42:51.952
Hey, congrats!

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:55.240
You're too quick to congratulate me.

00:42:55.288 --> 00:42:56.728
I don't even know if it'll work out yet.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.376
I'll go grab some coffee.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:03.544
Hey... uh..., I'd rather have milk tea.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:05.032
Natcha!

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.288
You're in such a hurry.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.520
Is anyone sitting here?

00:43:27.728 --> 00:43:29.520
Oh, no one's sitting here.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:30.864
Thank you.

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:35.016
What's your name? I'm Kan.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.000
I'm Natcha.

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:41.944
And why do you want to be a doctor?

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:47.552
Well... it's like... I like helping people.

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.528
And you?

00:43:49.696 --> 00:43:51.530
I also want to help people.

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:01.536
Natcha, wake up!

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.216
Everyone else has left.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.784
Huh... did I fall asleep?

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.040
Oh no, I slept through the first class?

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.752
I'm definitely going to fall class.

00:44:12.776 --> 00:44:14.750
Hey, you can borrow my lecture.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.048
Really?

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.312
It won't bother you?

00:44:19.584 --> 00:44:20.712
Doesn't bother me at all.

00:44:20.744 --> 00:44:21.304
Here!

00:44:21.432 --> 00:44:22.768
Thank you.

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.992
Natcha, your cheek.

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.064
My cheek? What about my cheek?

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.344
Ink.

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:35.168
Hey, really?

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:38.104
Where is it?

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:39.328
Has it come out yet?

00:44:39.368 --> 00:44:41.330
Come here,

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.824
It's okay, I'll wipe it myself.

00:45:08.832 --> 00:45:09.560
Yes.

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:32.304
What's wrong with you?

00:48:33.808 --> 00:48:40.456
I did something so stupid.

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:48.208
If he finds out, he's definitely going to hate me.

00:48:56.072 --> 00:48:59.544
He won't hate you. No matter what you do.

00:49:03.296 --> 00:49:05.752
I really don't want him to hate me.

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:07.976
I like him,

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.440
but I don't know what else I can do now.

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.120
I think you should just give up.

00:49:19.536 --> 00:49:21.540
If you can't handle it, just step back.

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.408
Believe me, he'll understand.

00:49:34.904 --> 00:49:36.544
Can I try it first?

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:40.672
Don't cry.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.672
Aren't your friends joining this meal?

00:50:04.976 --> 00:50:07.168
Oh, Klah went to buy snacks.

00:50:07.208 --> 00:50:10.416
And Mild probably went to eat with P'Knight already.

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:12.512
I saw them leave right after class finished.

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.608
Are Mild and Knight dating?

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.704
It seems like it, but it's not 100% yet.

00:50:19.024 --> 00:50:22.408
I saw P'Knight just offer to drop Mild off home.

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:26.400
What kind of person is Mild?

00:50:26.432 --> 00:50:28.128
I haven't met him yet?

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:32.432
He's a really good person, seriously. He's kind, loves his friends.

00:50:33.064 --> 00:50:34.660
Everyone in the faculty loves him.

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:39.520
Wow... Mild is that good, Does he have any flaws?

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:43.968
That's hard. I'll let you know when I find out.

00:50:56.656 --> 00:50:58.584
Oh, I forgot.

00:50:58.608 --> 00:51:00.608
I have another class. I'm leaving now.

00:51:01.648 --> 00:51:02.610
Oh, okay.

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.752
Hey, you were gone a long time. Was the que line long?

00:51:17.792 --> 00:51:20.392
How could you tell her about us like that?

00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:25.144
My girlfriend wants to get to know you guys. That's fine.

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:28.688
Don't you feel that she didn't ask about me at all?

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:30.856
She only asks about Mild.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:34.288
Hey, are you upset my girlfriend didn't ask about you?

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.144
You ass! I'm serious.

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.984
Don't just tell anyone about us so easily!

00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:41.880
I just told you my girlfriend can be trusted.

00:51:41.912 --> 00:51:42.872
What's your problem?

00:51:42.896 --> 00:51:44.680
So, you trust your girlfriend more than me?

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:45.696
Yeah.

00:51:45.728 --> 00:51:47.904
Yeah, you ass! Then there's nothing more to talk about.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.952
Hey Klah!

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:51.960
Klah!
