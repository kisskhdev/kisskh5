00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.960
I spent all morning making this!

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.800
All I asked from you

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.400
was just bringing it out...

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.320
That wasn't expected.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.280
My hand just slipped.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.160
"Slipped"?

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.360
Your phone never seems to slip!

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.720
Can't believe it.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.040
You know, your phone seemed

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.720
superglued to your hand.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.480
It's fine, Mom.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.440
No one got hurt anyway.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.040
There's still plenty left.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.600
More than enough for Ran.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.240
I actually had a hunch

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.240
it's gonna fall....

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.440
Before I knew it, SMASH!

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:31.880
"Smash" what?

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.480
It smashed on the floor!

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.360
You woke her up.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.079
No, I'm rested.

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.840
Went to bed pretty early last night.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.680
You skipped dinner yesterday.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.160
Mom's been worried sick.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.600
She got up at five in the morning,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.240
hit the grocery store, and made

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.440
all sorts of food,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.360
just so you won't

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.440
wake up starving.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.160
Yudong asked for leave

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.200
just to be with you.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.800
You're really holding him up.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.120
It's no trouble at all.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.480
You all just focus on yourselves.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.200
Don't have to fuss over me.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.040
Go back inside.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.840
Once I clean it up,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.120
I'll bring the food in for you.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.840
Go wash your hands first.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.200
Alright.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.240
Leave it to me.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.040
Just go ahead

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.440
and watch some TV.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.320
Take a break.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.560
We'll help you.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.800
Why you all

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.040
watching me like this?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.680
We just want you

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.760
to eat some more.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.160
I am wolfing down

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.600
my second bowl now.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.520
Eat well, sleep tight.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.640
Look on the bright side.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.800
Nothing really matters.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.040
Exactly.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.159
People online have beef

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.280
with almost everyone.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.280
Don't take it to heart.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.480
Turn a deaf ear to them.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.960
Unwise to reason with a jer...

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.640
Keep eating.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.080
I'll watch my p's and q's.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.200
It'll pass.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.800
Don't stoop to their level.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Those who are online all day,

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.000
to be blunt,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.360
they've got too much time on hand.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.240
So just like me,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.280
they cry for attention.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.720
Really?

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.480
That's a pinpointed self-assessment.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.240
He finally said something sensible.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.120
I'm telling the truth.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.480
Things are fine as they are now.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.000
This whole "influencer" thing

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.920
never rings

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.000
"a proper job" to me.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.920
Enough is enough.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.480
Right. My company

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.000
is already on track now.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.800
Financially,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.280
we'll see no pressure coming.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.760
Perfect timing

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.000
for you to resign yourself.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.160
Then we can mash

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.280
about the next project

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.320
that caught your eye.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.280
We'll figure it out together.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.480
He's so considerate!

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.680
Don't strain yourself.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.280
You're in safe hands.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.000
I'm not actually.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.760
I just can't let it go.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.800
I didn't mean what I was accused of.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.240
They were being

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.159
really harsh.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.600
It's not your fault.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.640
Just remember,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.440
no one

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.880
suffers more from your anger than you.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.880
Not worth it.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.920
"To express is to be misunderstood."

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.040
Said Lu Xun.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.320
I don't think Lu Xun said that.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.440
It was him.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.160
I saw this quote online.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.560
There was a picture of him.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.520
See for yourself.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.000
Lu Xun was a giant writer

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.880
and thinker.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.440
Very deep.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.120
Right. Even he's misunderstood.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400
Pick on me?

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.160
Just do it.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.960
Still looking? Dad, stop.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.640
Dad.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.520
Isn't this a shopping app

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.000
you're scrolling?

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.840
Where was it?

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.520
I'm all for Ran deleting the apps.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.000
Do we have to delete ours too?

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.080
She's not doing short videos anymore.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.840
What's the point

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.440
in clinging to them?

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.320
Go on, delete it.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.080
Dad, let's do this with Ran.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.800
Then, she can be back to a normal life.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.360
I'll go first.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.120
Done already.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.800
Right. Let me...

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.760
Wait, not the payment app!

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.400
You'll need it.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.800
Don't pretend you don't know how to do it.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.400
I...

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.440
Pretend, capable. Delete, truly no idea.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.160
Quit it all you want.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.760
That's it.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.040
Okay.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.440
Who is it?

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.240
Xinying.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.680
She contacted me,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.120
saying she saved up enough

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.040
and leased a malatang shop,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.000
and urged me to keep going.

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:39.560
She's grown up.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.080
Quite sensible now.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.800
When push comes to shove,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.240
you can always trust your family.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.360
Sir.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.000
Don't you think the paint

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.960
smell too strong?

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.000
None of the kind.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.000
Then why are you wearing a mask?

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.120
I have a cold.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440
Stop. Stop working.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.200
Stop it.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.280
What now?

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.120
This is

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.400
just regular paint, right?

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.800
It's all the same.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.760
Says who?

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.000
I made it clear that I

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.440
wanted eco-friendly paint.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.080
No real

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.880
difference.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.799
Unbelievable.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.000
The color doesn't match.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.080
Color saturation below standard!

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.360
It'll look the same once it's dry.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.440
This is a food business.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.360
With regular

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.000
paint,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.400
I won't be able to open for ages.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.000
Whose fault is that?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
No big deal.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.840
It'll dry in the same amount of time.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.160
No problem, I swear.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.760
I don't think it'd work out fine.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.000
I'll call your company.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.160
Go ahead.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.320
In on it together, aren't you?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.640
Fine.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.440
The consumer hotline, then.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.880
Maybe they can handle you.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.960
Look at you.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.560
Cut it!

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.640
I'll change it.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.560
Don't call.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.920
Youngsters now

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.040
have got quite the temper.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.480
Stop working on it.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.480
Change it first.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.280

Coming.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.640
Excuse me.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.360
Come in.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.000
You booked the cleaning?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.400
Yes. Come on in.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.280
Alright.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.280
I'll put on my shoe covers first.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:49.960
Okay.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.960
You've got tools, right?

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.360
Sure. We provide

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.400
professional service.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.000
Good. No rush.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.760
Alright.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.320
Your place is quite big.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.280
A four-hour deep clean might

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.320
not cover the whole place.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.440
Just do as much

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:07.960
as you can.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.240
I'll handle the rest.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.440
Feel free to leave when it's time.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.240
Okay, okay.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:51.920
Miss.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.640
Could I have some water?

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.800
Help yourself. Over there.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.440
You can pour from the kettle.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.320
Thank you.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.840
Excuse me, are you the...

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.880
Auntie Chicken Wing?

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.680
It is you, innit?

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.120
I'm meeting her in person!

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.720
I use your memes all the time.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.600
I use yours actually.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.120
"Desperate Personal Shopper", correct?

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.840
Yes.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.440
Looking back now,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.400
it was all

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.720
like a dream.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.320
When I was young,

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.480
my husband and I worked in Beijing.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.680
When our kid grew up,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.960
we returned to our hometown,

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.200
running a BBQ stall there.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.120
It's such a small town.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.240
The liveliest spot is the town square.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.400
There's a night market.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.080
[Young people love to]

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.560
[hang out there.]

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.520
[Crowded and lively.]

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.400
[Good for business.]

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.920
[Sometimes, nearby,]

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.560
[people would do square dancing]

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.840
to those real upbeat music.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.240
I'd just join in,

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.560
and stretch a little bit.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.920
Just to have some fun.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.440
[I don't know who]

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.920
[filmed me]

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.320
[and put it online.]

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.200
[Later, that clip of me dancing]

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.760
[got quite a lot of likes.]

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.960
[I didn't think much of it at first.]

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.160
Until one day,

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.440
someone came to tell me I went viral.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.960
Then, out of nowhere,

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.120
people flocked to my town.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.960
[They crowd around my stall,]

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.160
[snapping pictures]

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.000
[and whatnot.]

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.280
[They came from far away]

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.600
[just to see me.]

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.680
[At first, it was]

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.760
[quite lovely.]

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.560
[The stall was literally]

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.720
[cooking with gas.]

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.760
It wasn't long

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.720
before some MSN company

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.200
came calling me non-stop,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.480
offering to put me on live to make it big.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.280
As you can imagine,

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.400
they promised the world.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.360
I was so afraid it's a scam.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.840
I talked it over with my husband,

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.560
and we went to check it out.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.440
It's really a big company.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.880
But they

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.360
talked with us for a bit,

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.400
then put a huge stack of papers,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.240
and asked us to sign our names.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.880
[My husband and I...]

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.320
[we're not very educated.]

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.280
[So... we did, plain and simple.]

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.120
[Neither of us]

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.600
[saw the trouble coming.]

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.960
I signed an agency,

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.280
my business was steaming...

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.760
You can bet

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.800
I was doing great with grilled

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.880
chicken wings.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.600
People came from everywhere.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.800
Then someone got jealous.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.400
Mucking us up,

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.440
spreading rumors.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.480
[Although the bad guys]

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.640
[were arrested,]

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.400
[the scar]

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.760
[was here to stay.]

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.600
[So my husband and I]

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.760
[backed down.]

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.440
[We packed up and quit.]

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.040
[Came here to do an odd job.]

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.000
[But rumors die hard.]

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.280
[Leaving town]

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.720
[made them even truer.]

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.320
[As if we'd left with a guilty conscience.]

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.120
Every so often,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.760
I get recognized

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.720
and asked who I am.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.000
I typically brush it off.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.680
Then what made you admit it to me?

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:51.640
I felt like we

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.680
had something in common.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.280
You'd know

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.400
I was telling the truth.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.440
This morning,

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.240
I saw people cursing you online.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.680
That clip was

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.280
maliciously edited.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.760
I didn't mean what they said.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.240
I understand. I really do.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.120
Don't mind my lecturing.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.040
But I've been through this.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.840
Just want to tell you

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.120
to bite the bullet.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.600
If you get cold feet,

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.400
rumors can be

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.200
used against you.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.800
To be honest,

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.240
I really regret it.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.000
I shouldn't have chickened out.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.760
I should have

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.200
stood up to it.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.840
Those rumor-mongers are nothing.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.160
We didn't do

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.320
anything wrong, right?

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.120
Sorry, I'm being nosy.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.480
I'll get back to work.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.360
You're back.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.640
What happened?

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.760
Nothing. I'm thinking...

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.320
I'm going back to streaming.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.840
Okay. You are

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.560
your own person.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.080
For now,

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.440
I'm staying in the guest room.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.400
It's not about you.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.400
I don't want get in your way is all.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.920
Just stay in the main room.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.280
I've got nothing on the table.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.000
I'll stay in the guest room.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.160
All I need

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.280
is a bed anyway.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.600
Alright.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.480
You nearly freaked me out.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.760
Let's get up, alright?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.280
Okay.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.280
[I agree that ordinary people]

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.440
[should be rather shameless.]

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.680
[Your success]

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.600
[is exemplar of that, innit?]

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.760
Days ago, at the peak of the outcry,

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.720
the program team wanna release this.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.800
I went through hell to stop them.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.040
Look at this mess.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.120
I hoped you could raise your profile,

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.840
but some careless words

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.880
and everything blew up.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.240
Too bad that Zhang Ran,

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.920
a rising star,

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.240
now is ruined.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.360
Mr. Lin, this...

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.640
You're Tide Media's top streamer.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.160
I'll surely protect you.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.360
But if that video ever gets out,

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.480
no one knows

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.480
what it'll do to you.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.560
Keep your head down for now,

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.920
whether you're livestreaming

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.360
or at the office.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.000
Better safe than sorry.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.280
When things are going well,

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.520
people think

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.400
they're capable of

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.480
doing anything.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.360
But in the end, survival

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.760
comes first.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.520
Don't you think?

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.360
I'll take my leave.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:49.800
Go get some rest.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:14.840
[Hi, Anran.]

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.800
[Anran is here.]

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.680
[Relax. It's fine.]

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.040
Anran.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.680
Anran.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.440
How many products do we have today?

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.640
Less than 200.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.880
180 will do.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.520
Let me grab you some

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.400
throat lozenges.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.240
Where's my coffee?

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:05.960
I'll fetch it.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.000
Is this decaf?

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:24.720
Yes.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.760
Can't you read?

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.680
I really did tell the staff

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.840
I wanted decaf.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.960
This must've been a mistake.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.480
Whose mistake?

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.120
Mine.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.960
Are you trying to kill me?

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.040
How many times have I told you

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.840
too much caffeine

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.840
gives me heart palpitations?

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.040
Did you do this on purpose?

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.480
Can you please put some thought

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.640
into what you're doing?

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.360
Can't you be careful just once?

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.440
I'm sorry, Anran.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.560
I'll go buy a new one.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:36.760
Okay.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.600
Hello everyone, I'm Zhang Ran.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.840
Welcome to

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.840
my livestream,

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.800
Zhang Ran Live.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.800
This is my first time going live

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.920
on this backup account,

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.360
so I'm kinda nervous.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.480
Thank you to the viewer, FU,

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.680
for joining the stream.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.120
Wait, Fu?

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.520
Honey, is that you?

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.360
That username sounds like a swear word.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.440
Can you change it?

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.000
Can you leave her a comment?

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.000
Sure.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.800
Just say "Hi, sweetheart,

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.240
we'll always support you."

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.880
Hi, sweetheart,

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.840
we'll always support you.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.480
No, no,

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.760
delete "sweetheart",

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.600
or she will figure out it's us.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.440
Hi, we'll always support you.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.600
Right.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.240
Sending it now?

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.240
Yeah, go ahead.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.560
Thank you to the viewer

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.280
Easy Breezy.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.760
This is great.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.400
Usually when I text her,

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.800
she won't reply for two or three days,

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.280
but now she responds right away.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.960
Welcome Losing Control

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.800
and Wish I Were Rich

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.800
to my stream.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.040
Yes, it's me.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.040
[I did participate]

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.360
[in a show,]

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.720
[but what I said]

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.120
[was maliciously edited.]

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.280
So I want to

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.000
clear a few things up here.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.160
What I meant was not

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.080
what it looked like.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.960
I never called

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.960
anyone shameless.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.200
What I was trying to say is

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:15.760
that

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.440
ordinary people like me

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.960
have to go all in

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.040
if we want to succeed.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.560
So at that time...

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.520
Already gone?

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.480
Fine.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.040
[First, thank you so much]

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.560
for coming to my stream.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.920
Some familiar faces,

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.120
some new ones.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.200
There aren't many people here,

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.000
but I appreciate every one of you.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.200
I know you've all

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.560
had a long day,

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.360
so I'll do a stress-relief

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.600
dance for you.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.000
Don't get mad. Don't get mad.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.880
[Anger gives the devil a foothold.]

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.040
[Don't get mad. Don't get mad.]

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.840
[Anger gives the devil a foothold.]

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.440
Wait, wait. Is someone

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.400
requesting to join the live?

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.200
This is my first video call

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.200
on this new account.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.040
Okay.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.360
I'm on now.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.960
You're that Zhang Ran, right?

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.280
Yes, that's me.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:38.720
The Zhang Ran

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.680
who's been misunderstood.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.760
[Everyone in the live room,]

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.240

[Today we're]

[making history.]

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.920
We'll crush her

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.400
in this battle, okay?

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.800
[This one's for us]

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.680
[regular folks.]

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.960
[If you wanna see her get punished,]

[keep the gifts coming,]

[okay?]

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.840
Can I ask

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.600
what exactly is this battle about?

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.840
[Don't worry about it.]

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.800
[Just remember one thing.]

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.040
In the end,

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.240
it's about whose fans

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.080
send more gifts.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:01.880
Got it?

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.120
Okay, no problem.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.040
[As long as after this battle,]

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:06.720
[you can listen to]

[Win or lose, I don't care.]

[Hey, Mr. Wang, welcome.]

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.480
[Okay.]

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.600
[Didn't you say last time]

I've learned it.

I'll dance for you.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.080
How is it?

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.960
Thanks for the sports car,

Can you teach me how to send gifts?

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.360
I wanna send her one too.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.120
Don't waste money on that.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.400
A new era is coming,

alright?

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.320
You still need money to live.

[But thanks for your support.]

[A friend once told me]

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.720
[something that really stuck.]

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.440

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.280
[against misinterpretation,]

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.040
[it'll become the truth.]

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.240
This doesn't seem to fit.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.880
Thanks. Thank you, Liang,

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.159
for bringing me 30 followers.

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:13.520
Thank you for

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.679
following my livestream.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:15.800
Thank you all.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.199
No matter what,

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:18.960
having you stay in my live room

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.880
means everything to me.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:22.280
I'm really grateful.

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:23.480
Thank you everyone.

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:24.480
I hope you'll keep

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.760
hanging out in my stream.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.040
This is Zhang Ran Live.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.440
You're still up?

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.320
Honey, guess how many

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.320
followers I gained tonight?

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.520
Do you have to do this?

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.520
Of course.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.800
Up by 600.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.920
After a few PK battles,

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.920
I gained 600 followers.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.480
I now have

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.600
600 followers in total.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.400
I'm amazing.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.040
Just sit down.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.680
Come on, don't be like this.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.400
You should be happy for me.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.120
Look, everything I said

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.120
during the livestream

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.400
worked pretty well.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.680
At least 600 more

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.960
people believe me now.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.360
That's very

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.200
impressive.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.840
Just eat something.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.600
Aren't you eating?

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.640
I... Put that coaster

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.520
over there.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.440
I'm good. I already ate.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:49.960
Congrats.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.520
Bye.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.320
Leave the dishes there. I'll wash them.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.120
Okay.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.160
[Anran,]

[fallen this far.]

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.880
[Does Zhang Ran]

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.520
really think arguing can

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.000
change the facts? That's funny.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:53.960
Anran.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.960
Funny? I don't find it

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.960
funny at all.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.320
Tell me. What exactly

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.520
is so funny?

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.720
T-This video

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.680
really isn't funny.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.160
I...

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.600
I'll go prep for

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.720
the livestream.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.720
Right,

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.880
you should.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.400
You've got so much to do

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.080
and you're here watching

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.040
these boring videos.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:20.920
Go.

[No. 215.]

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.920
Did the company

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.280
give her that backup account?

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:35.920
No idea.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:37.960
Haven't heard anything.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.600
Aren't you pretty close

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.600

[When Zhang Ran left, he left too.]

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.280
He left with her?

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.960
How loyal.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.520
That's nice.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.960
If I quit one day,

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.480
would you leave too?

The perfume game

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.480
never slows down.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.400
When girls post their perfume collections,

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.960
it's not just about the scent.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.640
When they take photos

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.200
of perfumes,

how many bottles they own.

When girls post their perfume collections,

it's not just about the scent.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.080
It's about the quantity and the brands.

[I'm that Zhang Ran.]

participate in a show,

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.920
but what I said

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.560
was maliciously edited.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.680
What I meant was not

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.480
what it looked like.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.720

What I was trying to say is that

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.240
for an ordinary person like me,

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.880

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.160
of yourself in livestreaming,

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.680
you have to

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.040
be thick-skinned,

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:56.760

in a good way.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.320
So at that time...

Already gone?

[Doesn't your success]

[I'd rather work my ass off.]

[on my deathbed]
