"Doctor's Mine"
(Episode 2)

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.360
Where is it?

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.448
The red tube.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.392
I'll do it myself.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.816
The wounded should stay still, I will do it for you.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.576
Wait, you're squeezing it too much,
why don't you surgery me?

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.776
Come closer.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.424
Closer.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.208
Even closer.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.960
Why don't you just possess me?

00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:37.240
Can I?

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.984
Don't get hurt too often,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.688
I'm worried about you.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.376
Alright done!!

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.280
How's my work? Not bad, right?

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.536
Your hands are incredibly rough.

00:03:28.704 --> 00:03:31.976
Oh.. I even take you here to treat your wound.

00:03:33.272 --> 00:03:34.240
I didn't ask you to.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.496
But you came anyway.

00:03:49.168 --> 00:03:50.256
I'd better leaving.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.896
Wait,

00:03:53.168 --> 00:03:54.464
aren't you here to watch a movie?

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.992
It hasn't even started yet!

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.744
Oh my!

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.392
Ahhhh..hh.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.136
Ouch.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.816
Stay with me, I'm scared.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.616
If you're scared, why are you watching a horror movie?

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.184
You kept your eyes closed all the time.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.992
Because you seem to like steamy movies.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.536
Steamy enough for you?

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.728
Oh!! Why are you grumpy? Or...

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.960
Or what?

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.232
Or are you thinking I invited you to watch something else?

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.920
Are you trying to seduce me?

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.360
Then Can I?

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.680
I don't like people who mess around.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.320
If you're just looking for fun, go find someone else.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.960
I admit at first I just wanted to play around because you were interesting.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.112
But now, I'd be incredibly stupid to let you go easily.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.120
You like it.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.664
Nope. You smell like cigarettes.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.176
Who are you?

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.104
My name is Romeo, and you?

00:07:04.784 --> 00:07:06.072
My name is Juliet.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.824
Juliet.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.968
Juliet, you are my dearest.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.448
Mild, keep focusing on it.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.536
Yes.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.768
When did I become your sweetheart?

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.808
You just learned my name, Romeo.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.776
You are indeed my sweetheart, Juliet.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.432
The moment I first saw you, I fell in love instantly.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:18.272
And you smiled because you knew it too.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.104
Cut!

00:08:26.232 --> 00:08:29.200
Juliet, why are you getting shy?

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.752
At this point, you need to be seductive!

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.460
Seduce him! Like this!

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:37.480
Oh! You ass, why are you demonstrating so much?

00:08:37.512 --> 00:08:38.360
I'm getting goosebumps.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.176
Being a couple means we can act like this, understand?

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:42.824
Hey! No, It's not like that.

00:08:42.864 --> 00:08:44.952
Oh, How can it not be like that?

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.464
Knight seems to be devouring Mild with his eyes,
and you're gonna tell me you're not dating?

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.992
Hey, Knight!

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.960
Hey, Knight! Are you using your position
as an excuse to flirt with him, huh?!

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.184
Hey, hey! Enough!

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.208
It's okay, Mild, take a break first.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.088
And back when you're ready.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.840
Thank you, P' Kan.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.992
And you, If you're just to mess around with my brother,
I swear I'll kill you.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.584
How am I messing around?

00:09:21.608 --> 00:09:24.928
I'm serious, don't you see?

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.968
Just make sure you live up to your words then.

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.560
Hey guys, let's look at the script.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.648
Is there anything we need to adjust?

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.616
At the beginning part.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.352
What is this? Why keep teasing me!

00:09:46.384 --> 00:09:47.976
I'm not his boyfriend!

00:09:48.008 --> 00:09:50.872
Whoaaa! What the heck is this, they keep teasing me!

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.224
Ohhhh!

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.328
What the hell is that?

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.624
Oh, Nong Mild. Are you that hungry?

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.440
Why are you eating leaves over there?

00:10:14.472 --> 00:10:15.480
It's my business.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.704
What's wrong?

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.816
Sniffed too much formalin and gone crazy?

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.176
You're the one.

00:10:20.216 --> 00:10:21.440
I'm not crazy.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.088
Then why are you so loud?

00:10:23.128 --> 00:10:25.272
Because you were loud with me first!

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.104
Are you mad at Knight?

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.136
No.

00:10:31.424 --> 00:10:34.096
You and your brother are so alike.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.424
P'Per, Did you know my brother?

00:10:37.672 --> 00:10:38.672
Yeah.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.216
Hey hey, P'Per! What are you doing?

00:10:42.248 --> 00:10:44.744
Hey, let me go! Let me go!

00:10:44.768 --> 00:10:46.064
What are you doing?

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.304
Just having some fun, Don't worry.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.360
I'm here to deliver something.

00:10:55.976 --> 00:10:57.448
What the hell are you doing?!

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.992
I'll leaving!

00:11:04.016 --> 00:11:05.936
Shhh!

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:15.984
One, two, three...

00:11:18.376 --> 00:11:20.380
You're so possessive, like a hen guarding its egg!

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.376
Is this all the rehearsal for today?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.784
Yeah.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.520
I'm leaving then.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:28.608
Let's go.

00:11:28.632 --> 00:11:30.224
Why are you rushing back?

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.376
If you're leaving, then go.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.832
I still have to rehearse more.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.120
P'Kan.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.728
Yeah, you can go first.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.640
Wait, P'Kan.

00:11:47.472 --> 00:11:49.872
P'Knight, where are you taking me?

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.224
Are you trying to flirt with my brother?

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.664
Are you jealous again?

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.272
Jealous my ass!ิ

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.536
That hurts.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.408
Well! You two are so good at teasing each other!

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.768
Teasing my ass!

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.384
We've been sitting here for almost ten minutes
and you haven't ordered anything yet.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.720
You go ahead, Mild.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.432
You said so.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.920
I would like to order some food.

00:12:38.456 --> 00:12:39.752
What would you like to order?

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.184
Then I'll have the spicy lychee shrimp salad.

00:12:43.216 --> 00:12:43.900
Okay.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.040
Oh, and also the spicy and sour sea bass soup.

00:12:51.072 --> 00:12:51.888
Okay.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.472
And spicy seafood.

00:13:04.512 --> 00:13:05.072
Okay.

00:13:05.096 --> 00:13:05.792
Two rice.

00:13:05.824 --> 00:13:06.552
Okay.

00:13:06.576 --> 00:13:07.408
Make it very spicy, please.

00:13:07.432 --> 00:13:09.864
Okay. May I take the menu?

00:13:09.888 --> 00:13:10.784
Okay.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.152
Are you going to eat everything you ordered?

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.296
Yes.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.400
And what were you talking about with Per?

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.832
Don't call it talking.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.200
It was more like I was dragged there.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.944
Dragged you there?

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.024
Then why did it look like you were about to kiss?

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:35.520
Kiss?!

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.288
Why would I kiss him?

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.200
He was just picking a piece of leaf off me.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.024
Really?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.384
Seriously, who would go around kissing everyone?

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.744
Eat it all, I specially ordered this for you.

00:14:10.312 --> 00:14:11.296
Uh...

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.840
Oh, eat it!

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.024
You're not eating.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.424
Don't tell me you can't eat spicy food!

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.120
Nothing.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.264
Really? Okay, then eat this!

00:15:26.152 --> 00:15:27.728
And this one too,

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.448
this is the best, seriously.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.960
Oh, this!!!

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.968
Eat it all.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.128
Please, help me please, please.

00:15:39.152 --> 00:15:41.704
I can't finish it all, please, please.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.240
Doctor, Why are you so hurry?

00:16:09.288 --> 00:16:11.240
I'm hungry!

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.424
Wait for me!

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.064
Let's go eat!

00:16:16.104 --> 00:16:16.992
No!!

00:16:17.032 --> 00:16:18.824
I'm hungry.

00:16:18.848 --> 00:16:20.024
That's your problem.

00:16:20.056 --> 00:16:23.696
Doc, are you going to let my stomach rumbling like this?

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.304
Try listening, can you hear it?

00:16:27.352 --> 00:16:30.288
Oww, Doc!! That hurts!

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:31.976
Your stomach is rumbling so loud.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.824
Pinch belly tax, let's go eat together.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.760
Oh... you're so clingy.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.920
Fine, I'll go.

00:16:40.952 --> 00:16:42.288
What do you want to eat?

00:16:42.328 --> 00:16:43.240
Kan,

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:45.968
do you want to eat together?

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.970
Oh Natcha Great,

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.008
haven't you guys finished work yet?

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.064
I'm waiting for you.

00:17:00.096 --> 00:17:01.856
Let's go eat.

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.112
Uh...

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:07.288
Let's go.

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.544
Next time, then.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.088
Looks like I need to speed up.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.392
Thank you.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.976
Why didn't you tell me you're allergic to chili?

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.352
What would I do if something happened to you, huh?

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.096
Are you mad at me?

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:55.976
Yes, I'm mad!

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.816
An acute allergic reaction is no joke.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.792
If we had gotten to the doctor too late,

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.184
you could have gone into shock,

00:18:05.504 --> 00:18:07.360
stopped breathing, or even...

00:18:07.392 --> 00:18:08.720
Clam down.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.936
Still smiling?

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.856
I'm happy.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.560
It's worth it to see you worry about me this much.

00:18:24.264 --> 00:18:26.208
Is this the time?

00:18:26.248 --> 00:18:27.936
I'm sick.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.360
Could you hold this for me?

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.384
And... this too.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:59.344
Wow... Is this a house or a palace?!

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.344
P'Knight, I've dropped you off at home.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.664
I'll go back now.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.104
I have a headache.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.960
Do you have a headache?

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.248
Yeah, it's a headache right behind my eyes.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.224
Can you take me to my room?

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.976
And there's no one else here?

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:24.856
No one.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.224
So where's your room?

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.920
You're so kind.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.336
Or should I just leave you here?

00:19:37.352 --> 00:19:38.872
Oh!

00:19:38.888 --> 00:19:40.870
P'Knight, it's heavy!

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.968
Are you okay?

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.928
So which way is your room?

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.584
That way.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.072
This way.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.960
Why don't you tell me!

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.416
Hey!

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:00.880
Over there.

00:20:00.904 --> 00:20:01.840
P'Knight, Seriously!

00:20:01.864 --> 00:20:03.552
I'm headache, How can I do?

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:23.256
Hey!!

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.488
It's itchy. Please apply medicine on me.

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:34.768
Just do it by yourself.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.728
I can't apply myself.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.440
Please apply it for me.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:08.224
Okay, but you have to take a shower first.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.992
No.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.920
What if you go home while I'm showering? What then?

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.384
Stay with me first, don't go home yet.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:30.720
This is my fault.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.304
I have to take care of you for sure.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.176
Go take a shower first, I'll apply medicine for you.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:05.720
Hey.

00:22:05.968 --> 00:22:07.720
Hm... what?

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.680
P'Knight seems to be really enchanted to Mild.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.616
Yeah, it's true.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.704
But I think it's not just a recent crush.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.976
P'Knight must have had a crush on Mild for a long time.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.104
Really, Since when?

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:33.224
How would I know?

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.976
If I knew, would it be called a secret crush?

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:39.424
You ass!

00:23:12.368 --> 00:23:13.616
Hey P' Knight,

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.272
wear some clothes!

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.576
Oh… you pushed me into the bathroom right away.

00:23:19.592 --> 00:23:21.080
How was I supposed to grab my clothes?

00:23:33.856 --> 00:23:36.832
Uh... just put them on.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.848
Are you shy?

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.528
Nothing, why would I be shy?

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.368
We have the same things anyway.

00:23:46.408 --> 00:23:47.120
Oops.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.104
Are you done yet?

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.392
Okay, I'm done.

00:24:24.448 --> 00:24:27.112
Sit down and turn your back, I'll apply medicine for you.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.920
Next time just tell me if
there’s anything you can't eat.

00:24:50.576 --> 00:24:52.580
You just kept ordering food for me.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.344
Don't do that again, okay?

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.272
Okay, I'm done.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.720
Then take your medicine and rest,

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.368
the rash will be gone by tomorrow.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.744
I'm leaving now.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:22.464
Wait, Mild.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:25.960
What are you doing?

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.136
Hey... what are you doing?

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.936
Can you not go?

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.912
P' Knight.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:39.328
Don't be stubborn!

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.248
Are you really going to leave me alone?

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.888
Are you home alone?

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:55.240
Um.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.552
About your parents?

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.152
They're at work.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.240
It'll be several more days until they're back.

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:12.792
Are you lonely?

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.336
Sorry, I think I'm sick.

00:26:23.704 --> 00:26:25.340
It's not that I'm thinking anything,

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.728
but it's probably not good for a sick person to be alone.

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.600
Okay then, go to sleep.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.440
Don't worry, I'll stay with you this time.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.000
Good night.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:50.640
Are you awake?

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.040
P'Knight, let me go.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.552
I'm not letting you go.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.184
Let me go.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:00.848
No.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.248
Let me go!!

00:28:04.752 --> 00:28:08.680
If you don't let me go, I might feel bad for you for the rest of my life.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:21.968
I'm sorry.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.976
Next time, if you're going to do something, you should ask first.

00:28:30.016 --> 00:28:31.568
If I asked, would you let me do it?

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.976
Well...

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:38.568
Well... I'd have to see.

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:45.192
Can I hold your hand?

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.224
Um...

00:28:51.488 --> 00:28:52.296
um...

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.384
That means yes.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.800
Then...

00:29:14.992 --> 00:29:16.520
Can I kiss you?

00:30:12.368 --> 00:30:14.632
Thank you for allowing me.

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:19.032
I have an early class, so I have to go now.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:12.952
What the...?

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.088
Shit, what is this?!

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:52.552
What's wrong with your car?

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.544
I don't know. It just lurched and then died.

00:31:59.272 --> 00:32:02.448
Let me take a look.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.216
I'll check it out.

00:32:06.264 --> 00:32:07.768
You can sit in the car first.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.816
No, I'll do it myself.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.432
Why say no!

00:32:12.472 --> 00:32:16.464
You're a doctor. If your lab coat is dirty, will people trust you?

00:32:16.488 --> 00:32:18.904
Just wait and sit in the car.

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:19.936
No!

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.648
Go wait in the car and relax.

00:32:21.672 --> 00:32:22.560
Per!

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.360
Just relax, relax.

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:26.304
I'll take care of it.

00:32:29.312 --> 00:32:30.416
Sit down carefully.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.504
Here, to boost your energy.

00:33:39.392 --> 00:33:40.840
It's so hot!

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:35.976
What are you doing?

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.376
Nothing.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.768
Ahhhhh…

00:34:40.808 --> 00:34:41.952
What's wrong with you?

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:46.688
This shop jacket is only for wife to wear..

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.992
Who said I want to wear it?

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.240
You'll definitely be wearing mine eventually.

00:34:58.584 --> 00:35:00.580
Uh... How's my car then?

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:05.056
I've already fixed it, but It may work for a while.

00:35:05.248 --> 00:35:08.368
You should still get it checked out at the garage.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.088
Okay, thanks.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.792
How much is the car repair fee?

00:35:37.032 --> 00:35:39.030
Let's treat it as an engagement gift.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.360
Did you forget your cigarettes?

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:44.168
I quit smoking.

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:51.944
When you kiss me, it'll smell bad.

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:58.792
I think you're going to die from diabetes instead.

00:36:00.376 --> 00:36:04.680
If I had diabetes and a sweet-faced doctor Kan came to treat me.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.408
I'd willingly die from it!

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:14.712
Haha! You like that, don't you?

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.608
Just stay still.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.824
Consider it a fee for fixed my car.

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.792
Oh, what did I write down?

00:37:21.824 --> 00:37:25.992
I told you last night, you needed to read this part, right here.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.520
Oh, how did I know?

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:33.048
But Mild, you always passed the test.

00:37:34.304 --> 00:37:36.464
Did you make "One Night Miracle" last night?

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.976
Last night…

00:37:41.016 --> 00:37:42.240
Yeah, last night.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.432
Mild.

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:55.560
P'Knight! How did you get here?

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.504
You forgot some stuff, so I brought it here for you.

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:06.192
There it is.

00:38:06.536 --> 00:38:07.408
Why was it with him?

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.056
And I'm sorry about this morning...

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:10.712
Do you want to go to the toilet?

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.424
I'll take you to the toilet.

00:38:15.048 --> 00:38:18.608
I knew it! Mild definitely likes P'Knight.

00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:20.376
Hey... it's not certain yet.

00:38:20.408 --> 00:38:23.952
Maybe he's just... feeling fluttered.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:25.928
He might feel that way.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:30.264
Let's go get some dessert after class,

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:31.984
I'll treat you.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:34.640
What's your mood today?

00:38:34.656 --> 00:38:36.304
Rich mood.

00:38:36.328 --> 00:38:37.096
Alright, let's go.

00:38:40.632 --> 00:38:41.696
Hey P'Pat.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:45.550
Hello P'Pat.

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:47.360
Tum, where are you?

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.104
Oh, class is just finishing up.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.504
And I'm about to go eat with...

00:38:51.528 --> 00:38:53.904
Buy me some food, Come to see me at the faculty.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.512
Oh, okay. I'll buy it for you.

00:39:03.984 --> 00:39:05.980
Why do you always give in to her like this?

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:07.944
She's using you like a slave.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:13.016
Maybe she just wants me to take care of her.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:15.920
But I think...

00:39:15.952 --> 00:39:20.672
Sorry, I have to go buy food for P'Pat now.

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:37.680
Is it really that fun to tease me, huh?!

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:41.792
It's because I like you, that's why I want to tease you.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.960
You know that the more you do this,

00:39:45.992 --> 00:39:52.320
the rumors about me being your boyfriend won't die down.

00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:00.272
As for P' Mud stealing your girlfriend,

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.344
just forgive him so you can stop pestering me..

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:06.248
Hey Mild, I'm not mad at Mud.

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.024
Then why are you doing this?

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.968
I already told you, I like you.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.488
Seriously?

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:31.984
How clear do I need to be for you to trust me?

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.632
I already told you...

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:37.600
If you're going to do anything, ask me first.

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:48.416
So, can you trust me?

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:51.784
Why me?

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.576
I punched you on the field, and you just liked me?

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:57.968
Hey, we just met.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.984
Mild, This isn't our first time that we meet.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:11.792
Okay, if you want me to ask first, I will.

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.976
Can I date you?

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:57.440
If you feel bad or uncomfortable, tell me.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:02.368
But if you don't say anything, that means you're okay.

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:06.760
One,

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:17.640
two,

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:30.256
three.

00:43:22.288 --> 00:43:24.968
Knight's wife, Knight's wife, what the hell is Knight's wife?

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.576
Why would you waste your time watching?

00:43:27.608 --> 00:43:29.328
You know it's fake news.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.416
Oh no, Fern!

00:43:34.448 --> 00:43:35.144
What?

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.344
Look!

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:43.088
P'Knight returned the tie to Mild and apologized about this morning.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.856
They're together!

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.256
What the hell?!

00:43:46.288 --> 00:43:48.260
I don't think this is a joke anymore.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.656
What about N'Mild?

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:54.720
I'm here.

00:43:54.768 --> 00:43:56.360
Finally you're here.

00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:58.536
Here.

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:01.968
Oh! Are you her friend? Hello.

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.200
I didn't think you would bring your friend along.

00:44:13.552 --> 00:44:14.912
What's wrong with that?

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:17.960
Nothing.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.640
Thanks for the meal, Tum.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:29.592
Hey Tum, do you know Mild from the Faculty of Medicine?

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:33.688
Oh, Mild is my friend I told you about.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.072
Oh right. He's your friend.

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:40.696
He's my close friend.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.176
Hey!!

00:44:59.208 --> 00:45:00.280
Are you done yet?

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.480
Done.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.416
Are you tired?

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.944
Yeah... a little.

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:08.288
Here.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.128
Wow... hot Americano.

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.864
You know me so well, thanks a lot.

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:20.824
How long have you been friends?

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.424
Since freshman.

00:45:24.448 --> 00:45:28.000
Oh that's nice. You are really close.

00:45:28.048 --> 00:45:30.096
We've been close to breaking up our friendship quite a few times.

00:45:30.248 --> 00:45:31.256
So annoy…

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.224
Great!!

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:35.224
Dr. Kan, please sign this medical certificate.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.136
Sure.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.776
I'll bring it out to you.

00:45:37.792 --> 00:45:38.472
Okay.

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:47.256
Oh, don't you usually dislike dessert?

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.480
My blood sugar's been low lately.

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:55.032
Ah.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:10.624
Juliet, you are my dearest.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:14.888
Sir, When did I become your sweetheart?

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.176
I just learned your name, Romeo.

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.888
You are indeed my sweetheart darling, Juliet.

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:28.472
The moment I first saw you, I fell in love instantly.

00:46:28.504 --> 00:46:33.056
And you smiled because you knew it too.

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.224
Cut!

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:40.968
Oh wow,

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:44.440
that was so good! Give them a round of applause!

00:46:44.464 --> 00:46:46.792
Yeah, great job, great job!

00:46:47.384 --> 00:46:49.640
Congrats Knight! Finally...

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:56.312
Doctor, when you get married don't forget to sent us an invitation!

00:46:56.328 --> 00:46:58.310
It was just acting, Stop it!

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:00.976
Oscar worthy!

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:03.632
I really wanted to push them to kiss!

00:47:03.656 --> 00:47:07.024
Then I'll push you to kiss instead, wanna bet?

00:47:07.504 --> 00:47:09.000
Per, why are you even here?

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.232
You're not even an actor.

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:13.744
I... came to see my darling.

00:47:13.768 --> 00:47:15.440
Your darling, my ass, Per!

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.296
I bet the university page already has photos to upload.

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:24.872
Look.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:26.616
Stop it!

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.912
Oh, it's my business, I'm having fun.

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:31.552
Oh no.

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:33.952
You already promised me.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.928
I didn't break my promise.

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:39.872
Where's Knight?

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.672
Hey!! P'Mud!

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:46.832
Hey, what are you doing?!

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:48.184
Don't be nosy!

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:50.200
What are you doing, P'Mud?

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:51.320
Hey!!

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:56.160
If you guys are going to fight, go to fight somewhere else.

00:47:56.608 --> 00:47:58.344
Everyone is working here.

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:00.936
Let's go settle this outside.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.600
P'Knight, I'll go with you.

00:48:06.808 --> 00:48:08.600
No, just stay here.

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:13.192
Hey Knight, you can tell me anything.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.464
Oh, I'm going crazy.

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:27.952
You should try to control your brother!

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.696
Mild.

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.336
Hey, I think I'd better go check him out.

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.264
Oh..

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.184
Mild!

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.176
Will you stop bothering my brother already?

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.344
No way.

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:45.792
You ass!

00:48:45.816 --> 00:48:47.000
- Hey P'Mud!
- I told you to stay away!

00:48:47.048 --> 00:48:50.184
Hey, calm down P'Mud!

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:52.408
You're always trying to fight.

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:55.320
No need Mild. Just wait in the room!

00:48:55.368 --> 00:48:57.544
Just calm down, both of you.

00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:58.944
Please talk nicely.

00:48:59.288 --> 00:49:01.928
You didn't come home last night, Do you with him?

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.944
I told that I slept at a friend's house.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.216
What friend are you talking about?

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:07.080
Do you consider him a friend,

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.984
Even though he thinks badly of you?

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:12.256
Mud, I told you I'm serious about Mild.

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:17.624
Mild, listen to me. Knight can't be trusted.

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:19.768
That's because you stole his girlfriend first.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.400
Yeah, I accepted, I was falling for Ploy,

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:25.896
but that's because he cheated on her first!

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:27.480
He liked some other guy!

00:49:27.512 --> 00:49:28.512
Damn!

00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:29.912
What's your problem?

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:31.472
I'm just telling the truth.

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:36.616
See? He never told you,

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:39.952
and are you really going to trust him?

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:02.544
I trust you.

00:50:10.288 --> 00:50:12.290
If you're ready to talk, just tell me.

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:14.288
I'll always be here to listen.
