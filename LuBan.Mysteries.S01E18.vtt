WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.039
Lao Li

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.840
Ma Wangye, spare my life

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.079
Ma... Ma Wangye

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.280
Spa spare spare my life

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.239
Lao Li

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:08.079
Lao Li

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:09.120
Lao Li

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:14.719
Are you clearheaded now

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.920
When did you all get here

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:19.640
What just happened

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.400
Just now

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.760
You must have been drugged with a hallucinogen

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:46.920
Or you would not have acted like that

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.200
I truly do not know if I was drugged or not

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.959
But what I do know is

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:52.840
there is a killer who wants to murder me

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.200
But who this person is

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:55.120
I do not know

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.680
Lao Li

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.200
What did you just find out

00:01:58.519 --> 00:01:59.959
Behind the Ma Wangye statue

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.719
I found the material used to patch the wood

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.159
It was just as I imagined

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.400
It was Chinese cork oak

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.039
It is the special material

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.520
used to make cork paintings

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.879
Cork painting wood hid the body

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.919
A cork painting carving knife was used to kill

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.240
It is obvious

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.319
the killer is the same person

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.879
Lao Li

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.199
You most likely hit the killer where it hurts

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.159
So he lashed out like a cornered dog

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.439
I think so too

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.960
Someone came to my mind

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.039
All right

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.840
Let us give it a try

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.599
Master

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.120
Your skills are impressive

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.719
This wheel has rattled for years

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.240
You really fixed it as soon as you touched it

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.240
Do you know what the problem was

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.360
There is a crossbeam under this seat

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.280
The clip came loose

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:06.039
I found a new clip

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.759
Put it in and it is fine

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.639
Why are the dark circles under your eyes so bad

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.159
And your brow looks ominous

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.120
No way

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:22.479
It can not be because

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.960
there is a vengeful spirit in the house right

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.080
You you

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.240
What did you say

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:31.479
I I am not just talking nonsense

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.319
I have studied Qimen Dunjia

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.159
I will tell you a way to break it

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:38.960
You just need to find

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.759
the dead spirit body’s fingernails and hair

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.000
And then what

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.759
Then mix them with hen fat and quicklime

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.120
At

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.039
Right at the Hour of the Rat

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.400
put it in an iron basin

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.719
and bury it in the southwest corner of the house

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.159
Then the spirits will be driven away

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.199
and you will be kept safe

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.199
You

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.520
You you mean

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:03.639
what you said is real

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.240
What I said may not be completely right

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.479
but that is what Qimen Dunjia records

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.040
How dare you

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.839
You... y-you, you...

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.240
Why did you try to hurt me

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:28.079
N-no, it was not me

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.839
It was not me

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.079
I was not the one who harmed you

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.639
Then why did you still burn spirit money for me

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:36.920
I... I just

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.160
I just wanted some peace of mind

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.399
I am begging you

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.319
Boss Qin almost docked

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:42.920
all of your wages

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.959
Why did you still say he was a good man

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:50.000
I... I, I...

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:50.959
I know

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:52.759
He was not a good man

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.079
I used to curse him to die all the time

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.120
I changed my words just to lessen my verbal karma

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.480
You have not said a single true word

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.519
Today you are going to confess everything you know

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:06.079
That is right

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.680
I did it all

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.759
That night

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:14.079
the one that carpenter Li saw

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.439
the moving Ma Wangye statue

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.800
that was me in disguise too

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.560
Speak

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:19.959
What really happened

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.399
Boss Qin docked all of my wages

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.040
I knew he had just gone to the casino

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.759
so I blocked him on the road

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.680
But not only did he refuse to pay me

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.120
he even cursed me as a mangy dog

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.800
He insulted my son, insulted my whole family

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:37.680
I did not expect A Wen would worry about me

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:39.000
and follow right behind me the whole way

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.399
A Wen could not swallow the anger

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.759
and went to argue with Boss Qin

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.319
Boss Qin flew into a rage out of shame

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:44.680
and threatened to kill A Wen

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
In a fit of anger

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.600
I shoved him against the wall

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:49.439
I accidentally

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.319
made him smash his head open

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:54.720
Boss Qin

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.920
I let A Wen leave first

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.480
I was going to take Boss Qin to see a doctor

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:01.879
But when I thought of what he had done

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:03.079
In my heart, I...

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.519
I hated him so much that I...

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.240
I just decided to walk away

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:09.360
The next day

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.279
I was drinking with my coworkers

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:13.000
But I still felt uneasy

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.199
When my coworkers got drunk

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.839
I used the excuse of going to the privy

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.279
and went to take a look

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.680
Boss Qin was lying on the ground unconscious

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.079
I wanted to throw him into the river

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:23.519
and make it look like an accidental drowning

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.680
But I unexpectedly ran into Heipi A Si

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.879
That scoundrel Heipi A Si

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.480
He told me to give him 100 silver dollars

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.439
as hush money

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.399
There was no way I could pay that much

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:33.800
He threatened me

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:35.759
He said he would go to the police

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.360
In a fit of rage

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:41.040
I pulled out the carving knife I had on me

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.800
and stabbed Heipi A Si to death

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:46.199
When dawn came

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:47.680
I was afraid someone would find out

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.639
so I took Boss Qin's body

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.040
and hid it for the time being in the Ma Wangye carving

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.199
As for Heipi A Si, I could only dismember him

00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:56.959
I thought

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:59.079
I had done everything without anyone noticing

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.639
But I did not expect

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.839
you would still see through the clues

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:05.920
But throwing the body out toward

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.720
the four directions east, south, west, and north

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.639
is not something one person can do

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.040
Here is how it worked

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:13.360
After I dismembered the body

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.839
I put the parts into bundles

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.720
Then I hid the bundles

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.399
under the rickshaws

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.240
and set up a mechanism

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.800
I knew each rickshaw driver's

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.560
usual area and route

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.240
When the time came

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:26.480
the mechanism released and the bundle fell off

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.399
They did not know about any of this

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:31.480
Dumping the body was done by me alone

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.759
Oh, right

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.000
Then why did you take

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.399
Heipi A Si's liver

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.879
What did you take the liver for

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.600
The liver, his liver

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.759
I did not take his liver

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:44.279
You must have gotten it wrong

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:46.279
Then where did you hide his head

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.960
Under the tree in the back yard of the rickshaw yard

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:58.480
The head had been boiled

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.759
It was no longer recognizable

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.679
The killer is really bold

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.320
He actually dared to bury it here

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:07.360
But this case is finally close to being solved

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:10.840
No, something is wrong

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.720
Everything has gone a little too smoothly

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:14.960
I will go to A Wen's place first

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.399
You keep examining the body

00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:18.399
Detective Yang

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:20.120
Detective Yang

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.240
If you kill, you must pay with your life

00:09:37.879 --> 00:09:39.559
Do you know how much I hurt

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:43.159
Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed to death alive

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.080
Master Qin

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.519
I did not mean to

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:47.519
I am going to kill your dad

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.919
And kill you beastly drivers too

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:56.039
Son

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:58.360
Your dad died so miserably

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:01.039
Ma Wangye is coming to claim my life

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:03.960
The police are coming to claim my life too

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.519
This is all your fault

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.840
This is all your fault

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:12.720
It is all your fault all your fault

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.879
This is all your fault

00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:17.200
This is all your fault

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.240
A Wen your dad has been taken away

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.120
Let us go

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.440
Police open the door

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.080
Detective Yang

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:33.679
Do you still need something

00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:35.080
Your dad turned himself in

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.320
I have some questions for you

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:37.440
Impossible

00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:38.879
What crime did my dad commit

00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:40.440
Have you finished your investigation

00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:41.399
Listen to me

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:42.919
Your dad personally confessed to killing Heipi A Si

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.840
And Boss Qin

00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:46.799
Let us talk inside

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.840
You are all here

00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:53.399
I have to say you are really skilled

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:55.039
You could even stitch this back together

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.279
But hey do you not feel

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.759
Something about it seems a bit off

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.240
The build of this body

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.679
Is very similar to Boss Qin

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:07.080
Right

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:09.039
I think it looks a bit like him too

00:11:09.679 --> 00:11:11.120
That is what is strange

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.320
On the night of the twentieth you and your father

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.639
Ran into Boss Qin

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.720
What exactly happened between you

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.679
Boss Qin withheld all of my dad's wages

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:22.720
My dad and I went to ask him for the money

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.399
Not only did he not give me the money

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:25.759
He even cursed me as a poor dog

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:27.600
He cursed my whole family and shoved my dad

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:28.639
I could not swallow that anger

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:29.960
So I went to argue with Boss Qin

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.200
He flew into a rage and threatened to kill me

00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:33.879
My dad told me to leave first

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.600
After that my dad

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:36.240
Kept apologizing to Boss Qin

00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:37.720
My dad really is a coward

00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:38.559
But he could not possibly kill anyone

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:39.759
All right calm down

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.559
Boss Qin died on the twenty first

00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:43.519
It has nothing to do with my dad

00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:45.720
Can you show me

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.360
The carving knife you use for cork painting

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:49.960
All right I will go get it now

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:54.240
Detective Yang have some tea

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:55.519
About Xiang Zi

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.279
I still hope you will get to the bottom of it

00:11:57.639 --> 00:11:58.679
He is an honest man

00:11:58.799 --> 00:11:59.960
He could not be a killer

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.039
Yes

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:03.240
That is why I came to investigate more clearly

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:23.919
It matches completely

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.600
It matches completely

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.639
I understand now

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.639
The bodies were switched

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.639
The one hidden in the wood carving is Heipi A Si

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.759
The one dismembered was Boss Qin

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.480
A Wen and those two rickshaw drivers

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.799
Their alibis are all fake
