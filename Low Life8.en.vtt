Hello there. Hello.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:19.937
- Hello.
- Hey, kid. Hi there.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.271
Hey, good to see ya.

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.067
Hi, Mom, I'm home.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.485
School's already out?

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.946
- Go on. Say hi to your dad.
- Okay.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.243
I'm home, Dad.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.578
I finished school for the day.

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:38.914
Hey. Do your homework.

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:41.083
- Thank you.
- All right. See you.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.094
Fuck this shit.
I always get the shittiest hands.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.307
- Thousand.
- Shit. I'm out, then.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.143
I'm in.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.146
Hmm.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.985
Hey. Come on, man.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.821
Oh. Thousand?

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.409
I'll bite, then, and raise two.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.911
- Ooh.
- You serious? What, are you bluffing?

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:19.997
Call if you wanna find out. Come on.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.123
Come on.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.083
All right, fuck it. I'm in, then.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.919
Good thing I folded.

00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:27.296
I'll call.

00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:31.550
I wanted to see
why you're going in so hard.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:33.051
Flip it.

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:35.178
How am I always going first? You go first.

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:36.888
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.850
Double fives.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:44.146
- Tough luck. You lost.
- What have you got?

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.398
You ever heard of double tens?

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:47.482
- How lucky.
- Damn.

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:48.567
I win this time, man.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.237
So what was this magic hand you had?

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.573
Just a fucking pair of eights, that's all.

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.325
Shit.

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:58.493
- He's busted now, isn't he?
- Looks like it.

00:01:58.577 --> 00:02:00.037
I'm still in, you asshole.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.788
Watch, you just wait and see.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.082
- Hold on.
- Oh, sure.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.336
Hey, deal. Let's go.

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:08.587
Give me some cash.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:10.630
What cash?

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:13.300
Just give me 10,000. I need it to play.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.761
It's always money with you.

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:18.055
Do I look like your bank or what?

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:21.558
Go ahead and look.
You won't find a single won.

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:32.903
What the fuck is this, then?

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:50.642
That's the ship.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.228
Holy shit. I found it.

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.243
Hey!

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.938
- Whoa!
- Now, this is a real haul!

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:04.651
One, two, pull!
One, two, pull!

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.447
Oh, you wouldn't believe it.
This shit's all over the place down there.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:13.118
Be extra careful with those!
Easy, now, easy!

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:15.787
We're hauling up
whole fucking crates of them now.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.040
Now we're talking!

00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:21.835
I told y'all to be careful
lifting the pieces.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.128
There's scratches already.

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:31.720
Yeah! Here comes our boy!

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:33.805
- Just stop your bickerin'.
- Be careful.

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:37.058
Here.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:39.269
All right.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.188
- Up we go.
- Take it off.

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:49.404
That's good.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.285
- Did you find the shipwreck?
- Yeah.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.413
It was huge.
Practically filled with stuff.

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:00.373
- Nice!
- Shit.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:04.002
Easy. Get him down.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:06.046
The wreck was never here.
It was over there.

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.173
We were sniffing around the wrong spot.

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.258
Let's move after we have
somethin' to eat, then.

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:12.802
I'm slicin' up some pomfrets.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.888
Mix it with rice
and some gochujang, all right?

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.681
Here we go.

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.518
Man, nothin' like it, huh?

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:22.937
It'll clear your nose right up.

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:25.482
Shit, how many more dives
do we have today?

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.859
I'm guessin' five, at least.

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:32.947
- You should eat.
- Nah. I'll just get some shut-eye.

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:35.366
- Okay, go rest. Yeah.
- All right.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.869
Hey, Heedong.
Was it hard to keep your balance?

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:38.953
You'll be fine.

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:47.462

Oh, it says "Mokpo." Right.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.395
- That's him.
- Good afternoon, sir.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.147
Mind if I ask you a little something?

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:07.774
What is it?

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:10.360
Ah, I heard my friend got
locked up in this jail.

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.821
We just wanted to make sure
he's doing okay.

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:13.905
Who?

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.615
Name's Kim Deoksan.

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:18.243
He's a real big bastard.
Built like a damn gorilla.

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.120
He got himself locked up for fighting.

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:22.413
What's the relationship between you two?

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:26.584
He's my friend. What am I supposed to do?

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.425
- Step outside for a sec.
- Yes, sir.

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.386
- What?
- Man, that's gotta suck.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:37.804
Nah, I'm fine.

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:42.016
Uh, why are you here?

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.018
I'm taking you home. What do you think?

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.353
How'd you get thrown in the can anyway?

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:48.356
I was trying to catch a scammer
and it went sideways.

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:51.484
We're heading back.
Your mom was worried sick, you idiot.

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.987
I'm not leaving
until I find him.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.656
Why the hell
are you being so stubborn?

00:10:56.739 --> 00:11:00.034
Stop making yourself at home.
Let's get outta this hick town.

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:01.744
I mean, look at this dump.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:05.373
Fine. Then where is he?

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:08.835
Pottery hunting out at sea.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.628
Wanna go check it out for me?

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:13.131
Shit. Stay put, all right?

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.388
You don't have to feed him like that.

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:22.056
I've put him on an IV.

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.477
He's not getting any better, though.

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:29.981
Well, to be more precise,
he's been getting worse.

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:31.816
His blood pressure won't stabilize.

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.361
- And he wound up dehydrated.
- Really?

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:39.115
But if his condition were to decline
even faster than it is now,

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:42.869
let's just say, that would be
highly unnatural, Mrs. Yang.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.664
Sorry, what are you implying?

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:48.917
I know you're concerned
for your husband's well-being,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.419
but please don't give him
anything he wasn't prescribed.

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:54.756
Nothing extreme will happen,
so there's no need for you to worry.

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.098
Hello? Cheon residence.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.434
Asshole. How dare he?

00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:08.186
Yes, she's here.
Please hold on.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.648
Um, Mrs. Yang! It's for you!

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:20.448
- Who's calling?
- It's Ms. Jin.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.411
Hi.

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.455
Hey, girl. You have any plans?

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:30.458
- No, I'm pretty free today.
- Oh.

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:34.295
The thing is, Kim from Yeongdeunpo
is coming over today. Wanna join us?

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:35.630
Sounds great.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.508
That woman always knows
what to do with money, doesn't she?

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.135
- Okay. See you at 1:00.
- See you.

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:46.057
The roundabout at Banpo-daero,

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.643
they're turning it
into an underground mall.

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.395
Private capital's funding the whole thing.

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:52.855
Somehow, the word's already gotten out,

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.316
but it looks like
there's still room to buy in.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.193
Hasn't that ship already sailed, though?

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:58.778
I mean, even I heard about it.

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:01.281
You should try to get
a few commercial units in there.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:04.993
Namdaemun and Dongdaemun stores
are all going to Gangnam these days.

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:08.997
No, I doubt that's true.
An underground mall can't be that big.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.208
This mall's got it all.
Restaurants, bookstores.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.918
Just imagine all the customers.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:17.088
Oh, honey,
you're missing the big picture.

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:20.633
Why are you so dressed up, by the way?
You could pass for a bigwig American lady.

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.260
Oh, this?

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:24.679
We had a meeting earlier
at hubby's credit union.

00:13:24.762 --> 00:13:26.389
There were some files we had to handle.

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:28.975
Credit union? Can you explain?

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:31.936
Oh, my. I saw that
in the newspaper earlier.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.230
You're already in on it?

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:37.233
Hey, Kim, bring me the paper.

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:38.401
Sure thing.

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.613
Now, let's see. Hmm.

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:45.491
- This is it, right?
- Yes.

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:47.994
- This is the one we're using.
- Do you mind if I look?

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:54.625
Chairman Cheon,
doesn't he go there?

00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:57.670
"PROTECTING YOUR VALUABLE ASSETS
ILWOL CREDIT UNION"

00:13:57.754 --> 00:14:00.006
I think he does.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.557
Man, I'm exhausted.

00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:14.228
You're the last diver today.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.105
Don't worry, and do your best.

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:18.733
Put it on.

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:24.781
All right. This side.

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:27.825
- Push it.
- Yeah.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:57.105
What the hell?
I can't see a fucking thing.

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:11.077
Where the hell is it?

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:30.471
Whoa! I got it.

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:49.866
Oh, shit.

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.464
All right, the boats have arrived!

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:09.260
- Oh, they're here.
- Okay. We pulled up quite a haul.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.971
- Move all the pottery first.
- What about us?

00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:13.347
Can we head back too now?

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:14.557
Of course you can.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.226
Hwang and I will take care of
anything else that needs our attention.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.312
You guys go on ahead.
We've got Heedong with us.

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:21.314
Great.
We did a lot of work today.

00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:23.316
Man, I'm spent. Let's get going.

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:25.067
Are you sure you don't need us here?

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:26.485
Come on, now, we got this.

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:27.904
All right, let's move it over.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.780
- Okay.
- Seokbae.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.908
You can go. Good work.

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.451
Really? I can go?

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:36.370
Oh, yeah? But Jeonchul just went in.

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:39.665
Come on, we ain't rookies.
We're good here.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.376
Yeah, if you guys say so. Cool.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.337
All right. Be careful with all those.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.297
Yeah. That's fine, there's fine.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:49.383
Let's go.

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:54.805
Hey, guys, we'll take over.
Y'all can head back.

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:56.557
Okay, come on.

00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:58.643
What are you plotting now?

00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:03.272
- What do you mean "plotting"?
- Come on. You're sketchy as hell.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:06.108
Sending everyone back
all of a sudden.

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:08.694
Quit talkin' shit.

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.030
- Here, I'll take over.
- Go on.

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:13.324
- Help load the pottery.
- Go on. Yeah.

00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:14.909
I got this. Here.

00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:16.369
Push.

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:22.291
All right, take good care of the goods!

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:23.626
We're right behind ya!

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:39.392
- Huh?
- What's goin' on?

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:42.687
Guys, we're all done
for the day. We're heading back.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.730
- We're finished here?
- Sure are.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.233
- What about the other guy?
- We've got it covered, thanks.

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:48.359
You guys go ahead.

00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:50.069
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:52.905
We'll take care of the rest,
so y'all can get outta here!

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:55.741
- Get on out. Let's get you outta there.
- Yeah, good work, guys.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:58.244
- Hey, grab the air tank.
- I'm dead tired.

00:17:58.327 --> 00:18:00.204
- Hey, hurry up.
- Let's get you guys up first.

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.515
What the fuck?
Where the fuck is everybody?

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.643
- Hey! Take it easy, fellas. See ya.
- All right!

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:28.608
Let's get on outta here, let's go.

00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:31.152
Keep up the good work! See y'all later!

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:33.696
Yeah. We'll pull up a few and head in.

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.865
Make sure you eat supper now, ya hear?

00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:37.783
All right!

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:44.790
Can they see us?

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.626
Are we clear?

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:56.886
You're sure if we stop pumping,
he won't get any air?

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.221
Yeah.
The air won't go in on its own.

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:03.184
We can leave him be. He'll die quick.

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.228
Yeah?

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:09.231
Oh, man.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.852
What the hell? Hey.

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:48.562
Huh?

00:19:49.063 --> 00:19:51.148
- Oh, something's happenin'.
- He's pulling the hose.

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:52.358
Oh!

00:19:58.155 --> 00:19:59.407
I think he's climbin'.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.367
What do we do then?

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.452
I mean, it'll be fine. He's gonna die.

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:05.496
He'll suffocate.

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:06.789
Ah, shit.

00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:23.556
What now?

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:26.475
Oh! Oh! Hey, he surfaced!

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:28.144
What now?

00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:29.770
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, man.

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:31.772
- What the hell?
- Gee, that was fast.

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:33.482
- Fuck's sake!
- Hey, hey.

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:37.236
Stay the hell in.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.321
I said stay in!

00:20:41.407 --> 00:20:45.244
Ah, come on, man. Get the fuck down!

00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:48.706
Get down, motherfucker!

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.375
- Get back down!
- Hey, move.

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:53.043
- Out of the way.
- You're not comin' up.

00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:56.589
No, don't do it like that.
Here, give me that.

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.427
One more! Hit him again!

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:03.220
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:07.975
Damn it! He's gettin' away.

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:09.477
Give me the hose!

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.812
Pull the hose! Pull him in closer!

00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:14.857
Pull him all the way! Shit.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.567
Keep pulling!

00:21:28.662 --> 00:21:29.705
What are you doing?

00:21:37.379 --> 00:21:38.422
Whew!

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.383
Hoo-wee!

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:46.388
He's a goner.

00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:49.475
Stop pullin' it there. You can let it go.

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:50.643
Just set it down now.

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.564
Look, boy, he dead.

00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:09.203
There's a boat there. Who's that?

00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:11.372
What the...

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:13.207
- Ah, shit.
- They're comin' over our way.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.667
Give me a knife now.

00:22:15.918 --> 00:22:17.211
- Wait, what for?
- Cut it!

00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:18.963
- Cut the hose?
- Quickly! Shit!

00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:22.174
Move, move, move.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:27.513
Come on, hurry.

00:23:04.133 --> 00:23:06.176
- Pull up to that boat.
- Okay.

00:23:09.138 --> 00:23:11.473
Uncle Taesan! What are you doin' out here?

00:23:11.557 --> 00:23:13.267
I should be askin' you that.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.395
Funny story. I'm helpin' these two
try and track someone down.

00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:18.314
If you wouldn't mind
answering a few questions.

00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:22.401
Have either of you heard of a guy
called Professor Kim from Busan?

00:23:22.484 --> 00:23:23.485
Professor?

00:23:26.614 --> 00:23:27.615
I'm not sure.

00:23:27.698 --> 00:23:29.283
Why do you need to find this guy?

00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:32.453
A friend of ours dragged himself
all the way here to look for Kim

00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:35.497
but got caught in a bit of a mess and now
we're trying to find the man for him.

00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:38.876
And you wouldn't even believe
the places I've had to take these two.

00:23:40.377 --> 00:23:43.088
Well, I'm pretty sure, uh,
I heard he's in Jeungdo.

00:23:43.172 --> 00:23:45.341
- Jeungdo, is that right?
- Yeah.

00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:47.718
And do you know
where he's staying at there?

00:23:47.801 --> 00:23:49.678
There's a well
if you go straight from the dock,

00:23:49.762 --> 00:23:51.639
and he's staying
across the street from that.

00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:53.223
All right, I appreciate it.

00:23:53.307 --> 00:23:56.560
So what, um, are you planning on doing
when you find the guy?

00:23:56.644 --> 00:23:58.270
I guess that's up
to my friend to handle.

00:23:58.354 --> 00:24:01.315
I would think a scammer like him
should probably do some time.

00:24:02.232 --> 00:24:03.692
What kind of scam was it, exactly?

00:24:03.776 --> 00:24:05.361
I don't really know the details.

00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:06.445
- Oh, right.
- I think--

00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:09.031
- Well, then, uh, you should get going now.
- Yeah.

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:10.616
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right, thanks, Uncle.

00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:12.451
- Start it up. We gotta hurry now.
- All right.

00:24:16.497 --> 00:24:17.873
Take it easy, guys.

00:24:18.791 --> 00:24:20.709
Bye, Uncle Taesan. Take it easy.

00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:28.384
Shit.

00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:45.776
{\an8}ILWOL CREDIT UNION

00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:47.277
{\an8}Here's your safe, ma'am.
Number 29.

00:24:47.361 --> 00:24:49.738
- Take the key and insert it right here.
- Oh.

00:24:50.948 --> 00:24:52.783
Now, then,
we're going to turn it clockwise

00:24:52.866 --> 00:24:54.535
- at the exact same time.
- Okay.

00:24:54.618 --> 00:24:57.287
And one, two, three.

00:24:58.455 --> 00:25:00.374
Oh.

00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:03.961
This is how it works.

00:25:04.044 --> 00:25:05.838
- One moment, please.
- Sure.

00:25:08.465 --> 00:25:11.176
- Here we are. Follow me, please.
- Yes.

00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:25.107
- You can use this room, ma'am.
- Okay.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.526
- Please call if you need assistance, okay?
- Thanks.

00:25:55.304 --> 00:25:56.847
What the hell is all this junk?

00:26:09.943 --> 00:26:11.278
"Dear Sun."

00:26:12.154 --> 00:26:14.281
"Now that autumn has come
and the leaves are falling,

00:26:14.364 --> 00:26:15.866
I feel the fleeting nature of time."

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.788
"Sun, your absence aches and I can't bear
to live another moment without you."

00:26:22.498 --> 00:26:25.375
"The void within my heart only grows
with each passing day."

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.514
Shit.

00:26:45.229 --> 00:26:46.814
How long has she been gone now?

00:26:46.897 --> 00:26:48.732
You're still obsessed with her.

00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:04.123
Oh, man, I'm fried.

00:27:04.206 --> 00:27:05.332
Nice work today.

00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:08.127
Thought I'd grab new diving gear.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.505
- Well, Mokpo's got everything we need.
- Let's make it quick.

00:27:11.588 --> 00:27:13.132
- We're out of time.
- I know.

00:27:13.215 --> 00:27:14.424
We need it fast.

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:16.510
Hey, hey.

00:27:16.593 --> 00:27:18.053
Why'd you do it?

00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:20.764
- Why'd you do that?
- You little fucker.

00:27:20.848 --> 00:27:23.475
Shit!

00:27:25.811 --> 00:27:27.187
Ah, come on. What are you doing?

00:27:27.271 --> 00:27:29.314
- Look, use your words.
- You motherfucker, we're just talking!

00:27:29.398 --> 00:27:30.732
- Hey, hey!
- Why'd you do it?

00:27:30.816 --> 00:27:32.943
- You piece of shit!
- Stop him.

00:27:33.026 --> 00:27:34.528
- You fucking killed him!
- Stop it now!

00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:36.071
- You fucking...
- Just stop him!

00:27:37.364 --> 00:27:39.366
When I came back
to Seoul after the war,

00:27:39.449 --> 00:27:41.618
the city was a total wreck.

00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:45.789
But even in that situation, there were
still guys who were able to make money.

00:27:46.373 --> 00:27:49.418
We're here to get pottery.
We're not here to kill anyone.

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:51.712
Look, these things happen
when you're working.

00:27:51.795 --> 00:27:54.381
People died when they built
the Gyeongbu Expressway.

00:27:54.464 --> 00:27:56.675
Think they built that road
with an intention to kill?

00:27:56.758 --> 00:27:58.635
No, it just happened on the job.

00:27:59.219 --> 00:28:00.637
Those were all accidents, Uncle.

00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:02.431
- You killed a guy.
- Yeah.

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:04.349
That's the reason
why we should be working even harder.

00:28:04.433 --> 00:28:06.435
For the sake of those who had to die.

00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:10.272
Look, if we can turn this shit into gold,
their deaths won't be for nothing.

00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:12.441
That's bullshit and you know it.

00:28:16.445 --> 00:28:19.615
Heedong, when we're done with this job,

00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:22.159
I'll give you ten million won.

00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:26.955
You don't think I will?

00:28:28.373 --> 00:28:30.167
You know I always keep my word, right?

00:28:31.084 --> 00:28:33.337
Let's make all the money we can.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.506
You wanna live clean?
Well, it takes money to do that.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.675
You think you'll have a good life
without money?

00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:41.678
Then if we do this job the right way,
we'll be rolling in it.

00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:44.139
It'll be great.

00:28:46.475 --> 00:28:47.809
Hey, Heedong.

00:28:51.021 --> 00:28:52.147
What's wrong?

00:28:53.607 --> 00:28:57.027
Jeonchul... He was Mrs. Yang's ex-husband.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.695
What?

00:28:58.779 --> 00:29:01.615
The man you just murdered was her husband.
Don't you get it?

00:29:06.536 --> 00:29:08.205
Wait, how do you even know that?

00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:10.290
He told me himself.

00:29:11.541 --> 00:29:13.877
He said that once Chairman Cheon dies,
they're gonna get back together.

00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:17.297
How do you think she's gonna take this?

00:29:43.699 --> 00:29:47.285
I see now that I was always
just a little bookkeeper to you.

00:29:47.995 --> 00:29:48.996
Wasn't I?

00:29:50.163 --> 00:29:51.540
You fucking asshole!

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:55.502
What did you do with the seals?

00:29:56.086 --> 00:29:57.963
Where the hell are they?

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:07.848
Hi. May I ask who's calling?

00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:09.808
Evening, ma'am. It's Oh Gwanseok.

00:30:10.392 --> 00:30:11.560
Oh.

00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:14.646
- And what's the reason for this call?
- Actually this is quite urgent,

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.606
so I got your number from Mr. Song.

00:30:17.107 --> 00:30:18.316
Ah.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.110
How's everything going over there?

00:30:20.193 --> 00:30:23.405
Well, the work is going fine, but...

00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:30.037
Uh... Jeonchul died in an accident.

00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:33.290
What?

00:30:33.373 --> 00:30:35.959
He got caught
in the propeller underwater.

00:30:36.043 --> 00:30:38.754
It happened so fast
that we couldn't do anything.

00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:42.883
He got caught in the...

00:30:44.134 --> 00:30:45.427
You're saying he died?

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.804
Yeah, it was while he was diving.

00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:50.348
Uh, it happened so suddenly.

00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:52.225
I'm sorry.

00:30:52.309 --> 00:30:54.811
I should've been
more careful about safety.

00:30:58.315 --> 00:30:59.316
Ma'am?

00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:02.527
Ma'am, are you all right?

00:31:09.034 --> 00:31:10.035
And the body?

00:31:12.662 --> 00:31:15.165
His body got swept away. We lost him.

00:31:15.749 --> 00:31:17.000
Did you call the police?

00:31:17.084 --> 00:31:18.794
Well, ma'am, as you're aware...

00:31:19.628 --> 00:31:21.963
that's not an option
with the work we're doing.

00:31:23.173 --> 00:31:24.758
One of the crew died...

00:31:25.634 --> 00:31:29.221
And there's no body,
and no one reported it.

00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:31.264
Look, I'm sorry it turned out this way.

00:31:31.348 --> 00:31:34.559
I mean, I'm just as shocked as you--

00:31:39.523 --> 00:31:41.274
What a mess.

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:46.905
Don't tell me...

00:31:50.075 --> 00:31:51.284
Did you do this?

00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:10.220
Go.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.486
Hmm.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:27.571
You Kim?

00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:29.573
Mmm...

00:32:29.656 --> 00:32:33.368
I'm not.
He's in there, that room.

00:32:43.044 --> 00:32:45.672
- What's going on?
- Hey, are you Professor Kim?

00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:49.092
Well...

00:32:49.176 --> 00:32:50.594
Don't move!

00:32:50.677 --> 00:32:53.138
I'll kill you assholes!

00:32:53.763 --> 00:32:55.724
Who the hell are you? Huh?

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:57.559
Look at you. That a gun?

00:32:57.642 --> 00:33:00.979
- I said who are you?
- Listen, you can just drop the act.

00:33:01.062 --> 00:33:02.856
We're here from Busan.
Let's not make this hard.

00:33:05.942 --> 00:33:08.612
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

00:33:08.695 --> 00:33:12.115
You shoot that thing one more time and I
swear I'm gonna rip your fucking head off.

00:33:12.199 --> 00:33:13.533
Fucking shit stain!

00:33:13.617 --> 00:33:16.494
Who the hell sent you?
Stay put, you bastard!

00:33:26.755 --> 00:33:28.089
I'll break your fucking wrist.

00:33:28.173 --> 00:33:30.217
Now let go.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.469
I give up. I give up!

00:33:35.222 --> 00:33:37.349
Fucking bitch.

00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:38.558
Enough.

00:33:42.229 --> 00:33:43.230
Idiot.

00:33:46.816 --> 00:33:47.943
All right, move it.

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:51.780
- Where are you taking me?
- To go and pay for your crimes, you shit.

00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:54.824
- Wait, what the hell did I do to--
- Shut the hell up. Fuckin'...

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.285
- Bring him.
- Yes, sir.

00:33:57.786 --> 00:33:59.537
- Ah, shit.
- All right.

00:34:02.207 --> 00:34:04.668
Are you serious?

00:34:05.252 --> 00:34:07.045
Hold on. I need my glasses.

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:10.257
Can you believe this jackass?

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.716
- Let's get going!
- Hey, look.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.593
Can you grab my jacket?

00:34:14.177 --> 00:34:18.223
So old Kim here...
Well he's one connected guy.

00:34:19.015 --> 00:34:21.017
The police here aren't gonna do anything.

00:34:21.101 --> 00:34:24.479
Don't worry about that. There are
plenty of places he can face justice.

00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:27.732
Move it already.

00:34:27.816 --> 00:34:28.984
- Move it already.
- Come on.

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.735
- Take it easy.
- What's taking so long? Let's go!

00:34:30.819 --> 00:34:33.780
- Yes, sir.
- Hey! I won't be gone long.

00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:35.657
- Come on, let go of me.
- Keep it moving.

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.117
- Quit yapping.
- Where are you taking me?

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.326
Just shut it.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.161
Hey.

00:34:41.037 --> 00:34:42.998
Where you taking him?
All the way back to Busan?

00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:44.582
Yeah, why do you ask?

00:34:45.667 --> 00:34:48.503
Well, the thing is,
that guy knows too much, you see.

00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:52.590
Don't worry about it.
He won't be back. We'll take care of him.

00:34:53.133 --> 00:34:54.384
Right.

00:34:54.467 --> 00:34:57.053
By the way, I called the cops and
your friend should be out pretty quickly.

00:34:57.137 --> 00:34:59.389
Much appreciated, man. Take it easy now.

00:34:59.472 --> 00:35:00.473
Yeah.

00:35:07.355 --> 00:35:08.481
Huh?

00:35:10.066 --> 00:35:11.067
Is that a...

00:35:13.445 --> 00:35:14.613
What...

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:16.781
Holy shit!

00:35:19.534 --> 00:35:22.162
Shoot.

00:35:29.377 --> 00:35:31.046
HOLDING CELL

00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:33.340
I don't wanna see you
anywhere near Mokpo again.

00:35:33.423 --> 00:35:35.008
- Got it?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:37.719
And keep your fucking mouth shut.

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:41.973
Everything you saw here, forget it.
Everything, you understand?

00:35:42.057 --> 00:35:45.018
My business here is finished, man,
so I already forgot.

00:35:45.518 --> 00:35:49.230
Oh, and also, you two
should come by if you're in Busan.

00:35:49.314 --> 00:35:51.650
The store's name is Deoksan Antique Shop.

00:35:51.733 --> 00:35:54.819
Quit talking shit.
Just get out of here.

00:35:57.405 --> 00:35:58.907
Take care, boys.

00:36:00.867 --> 00:36:03.495
- What took you so long?
- Those clowns are cute.

00:36:03.578 --> 00:36:05.246
- Get in on that side.
- Right.

00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:11.920
Make some room.

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:14.172
- Move your damn ass!
- We're gonna go like this?

00:36:14.255 --> 00:36:16.091
- Shit.
- This isn't going to work.

00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:17.634
Fucking deal with it.

00:36:17.717 --> 00:36:19.594
Hey, I can't breathe.

00:36:19.678 --> 00:36:21.930
We're going to Busan crammed like this?

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:24.724
Listen, listen. What if...
What if I got my own ride?

00:36:24.808 --> 00:36:26.935
- You shitting me?
- So you're Kim, are ya?

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.606
Hey, look at me.

00:36:33.108 --> 00:36:34.859
You scammed my ma, didn't you?

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.153
Wait a sec,
why would I do that?

00:36:37.237 --> 00:36:39.864
You shit!

00:36:39.948 --> 00:36:40.949
What do you think?

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:43.952
Should I crack your fucking skull open
or rip your jaw clean off your face?

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:45.537
Look, let's not do this.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.540
I'll pay her back
and fix everything, all right?

00:36:48.623 --> 00:36:51.167
- Just...
- Hey, save the chitchat for Busan

00:36:51.251 --> 00:36:53.002
and let's get going. Got that?

00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:54.838
Time to move out.

00:36:58.591 --> 00:37:00.343
{\an8}GOOD LUCK COFFEE SHOP

00:37:00.427 --> 00:37:02.345
Welcome.

00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:05.056
Where's Seonja?

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.891
- Get out of here.
- Why?

00:37:06.975 --> 00:37:08.643
- Just get out of here.
- Wait, why?

00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:11.312
Because if Ms. Jang sees you
she'll be furious, so get out!

00:37:11.396 --> 00:37:13.273
- Just tell me why!
- You snake.

00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:16.693
Why did you have to come into her life
and put all those ideas in her head.

00:37:16.776 --> 00:37:19.404
That poor girl. It's just so awful.

00:37:19.487 --> 00:37:22.157
Uh, what... What's going on?

00:37:24.826 --> 00:37:26.453
What the hell is this?

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:28.413
Where the hell is Seonja?

00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:31.040
You better watch your mouth
when you speak to me.

00:37:31.124 --> 00:37:34.002
- Before I slap it off your face.
- Shit.

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.298
Brat thinks
he can treat me like this.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.390
The hell did you do with her?

00:37:48.308 --> 00:37:50.810
Who the hell do you think you are,
looking for her?

00:37:50.894 --> 00:37:53.605
You two gonna shack up together?
Is that what this is about?

00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:56.107
- What?
- Bitch didn't have her head on straight.

00:37:56.191 --> 00:37:57.817
An island brothel bought her.

00:37:57.901 --> 00:37:59.652
Which one?

00:37:59.736 --> 00:38:00.945
Where'd she go?

00:38:01.029 --> 00:38:04.032
You fucking...
Where the hell did you put her?

00:38:04.824 --> 00:38:05.950
Shit!

00:38:06.034 --> 00:38:08.536
Go on, go on.
Tear the whole place apart.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.872
What, you expect me
to be shaking in my boots?

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:14.042
- Trying to scare me, huh?
- Please, Ms. Jang.

00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:16.795
Please let Seonja go. That poor girl--

00:38:16.878 --> 00:38:19.547
How dare you question me.

00:38:19.631 --> 00:38:21.466
Should I ship you off as well?

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:24.844
Threaten me all you want,
I'm not budging on this.

00:38:24.928 --> 00:38:27.347
You know how much that bitch has cost me?

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:30.058
I'll get you your money.
How much will it take?

00:38:31.643 --> 00:38:33.019
You got money?

00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:36.189
In that case, bring me a million, boy.

00:38:37.607 --> 00:38:38.817
That too much for ya?

00:38:39.484 --> 00:38:41.820
Hey, just get lost. I'll call the police.

00:38:41.903 --> 00:38:43.154
You'll get your money.

00:38:43.822 --> 00:38:46.366
If one hair on her head's out of place,
you're gonna pay for it.

00:38:46.449 --> 00:38:48.117
Save the talking
for when you got the cash.

00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:50.036
But keep in mind...

00:38:50.119 --> 00:38:52.747
I wouldn't waste time if I were you.
Don't want damaged goods.

00:38:52.831 --> 00:38:54.541
I get it, so keep your word.

00:39:06.845 --> 00:39:08.847
Take that outside. Damn it.

00:39:13.852 --> 00:39:16.813
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, that was great. See you later.

00:39:16.896 --> 00:39:18.606
- Take care.
- Yeah.

00:39:26.489 --> 00:39:28.992
Hey, girl. You've got to eat now.

00:39:30.785 --> 00:39:33.538
Come on, open up!

00:39:35.456 --> 00:39:37.458
For fucks sake.

00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:39.961
You're a damn stubborn one, aren't ya?

00:39:41.921 --> 00:39:44.048
Hurry up and eat something already.

00:39:56.603 --> 00:39:58.313
Let's make all the money we can.

00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:01.524
You wanna live clean?
Well, it takes money to do that.

00:40:01.608 --> 00:40:03.693
You think you'll have
a good life without money?

00:40:04.277 --> 00:40:07.196
And if we do this job the right way,
we'll be rolling in it.

00:40:16.372 --> 00:40:17.498
Yeah, bad news.

00:40:18.917 --> 00:40:20.084
Jeonchul's dead.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.257
Did you say Jeonchul's dead?

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:29.802
What are you saying? What the hell.

00:40:29.886 --> 00:40:32.430
His air hose.
It got caught in the propeller.

00:40:32.513 --> 00:40:33.765
Yeah, you see...

00:40:33.848 --> 00:40:37.101
It was so sudden, like...
...you know?

00:40:37.185 --> 00:40:38.770
There was nothing we could do.

00:40:41.648 --> 00:40:43.733
Heedong, is this true?

00:40:43.816 --> 00:40:46.444
Are they telling the truth?
How did this happen?

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:50.406
Why did you start the engine?
We always keep it off when we work.

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.660
That was 'cause the current
got mighty strong,

00:40:53.743 --> 00:40:56.746
and we started rockin' around real hard.

00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:59.582
In fact if I hadn't turned it on then,
we would have flipped over.

00:40:59.666 --> 00:41:01.042
Wait, hold on a second.

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.461
The current got so strong
you had to turn on the engine?

00:41:03.544 --> 00:41:06.965
I said it was strong, didn't I?
What's with the third degree, damn it?

00:41:07.048 --> 00:41:09.342
What, you think we wanted him to die?
It was a freak accident.

00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:10.468
What the hell?

00:41:10.551 --> 00:41:12.512
Hey man, somebody just died out there.

00:41:12.595 --> 00:41:14.681
Am I not allowed to ask
a damn question about it?

00:41:14.764 --> 00:41:16.808
- Hey, hey, hey!
- If you were sailing--

00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:18.977
- Give it a damn rest.
- Damn it.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.645
That's enough.

00:41:20.728 --> 00:41:22.730
Why does this keep happening?

00:41:23.231 --> 00:41:25.274
What the hell is going on?

00:41:25.858 --> 00:41:28.069
Heedong. Is that true?

00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:30.196
Come on, man. Say something!

00:41:34.951 --> 00:41:38.329
We tried everything we could.
It just happened so fast.

00:41:38.413 --> 00:41:40.206
He was just gone.

00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:41.958
And the body? Where is it?

00:41:42.041 --> 00:41:43.084
Pulled by the current.

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:44.419
I don't think we'll find it.

00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:46.713
Good grief.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.883
Jeonchul dies out there,
the professor gets nabbed.

00:41:50.967 --> 00:41:52.885
We're all cursed, that's what I think.

00:41:52.969 --> 00:41:55.430
Don't give me that crap
when y'all are glad

00:41:55.513 --> 00:41:58.516
'cause the split is better this way.

00:41:59.058 --> 00:42:01.728
What? Gonna tell me I'm wrong?

00:42:02.478 --> 00:42:05.314
I know that's what all the rest of you
are thinking.

00:42:12.071 --> 00:42:13.573
I realize it's a terrible thing,

00:42:13.656 --> 00:42:16.784
but at the same time
the dead are gone. Right?

00:42:17.869 --> 00:42:21.330
Now, what matters is that
we pick up the pace, yeah?

00:42:22.123 --> 00:42:24.083
- All right, come on.
- What more can we do?

00:42:24.876 --> 00:42:26.127
I mean we're dropping dead.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:29.422
But also, we're running out of space
for the ceramics.

00:42:29.505 --> 00:42:31.049
We gotta put 'em somewhere else.

00:42:31.132 --> 00:42:33.593
I'll find a place. Somewhere in Muan.

00:42:33.676 --> 00:42:35.678
- Let's move it all after that.
- 'Kay.

00:42:35.762 --> 00:42:38.139
How are we supposed to get
1000 pieces like this?

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:41.434
We got two problems.
None of us can see shit down there.

00:42:41.517 --> 00:42:43.895
And the shipwreck's so full of mud,
it's hard to pull things out.

00:42:43.978 --> 00:42:45.313
That's right.

00:42:45.813 --> 00:42:49.817
If we could just clear the mud out,
then of course, would make things easier.

00:42:49.901 --> 00:42:52.195
{\an8}In that case, what if we rent a barge...

00:42:52.278 --> 00:42:53.738
{\an8}"BARGE: A SHIP WITH A FLAT FLOOR"

00:42:53.821 --> 00:42:56.157
{\an8}...and pump out all the mud
that's blocking us down there?

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.743
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's a good idea.

00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:00.953
- We'll be able to move faster.
- Of course.

00:43:01.037 --> 00:43:03.915
But operating a barge,
that'll take more hands.

00:43:03.998 --> 00:43:04.999
No, we can't do that.

00:43:05.083 --> 00:43:07.293
The fishing boats will just
report us right away.

00:43:07.376 --> 00:43:10.546
Have you ever seen a single patrol boat
out there while we're working?

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:13.049
Has anyone even given a shit
about what we're doing out there?

00:43:13.132 --> 00:43:14.550
How the hell would anyone know?

00:43:14.634 --> 00:43:17.720
No one could possibly tell it's
a government barge just by looking at it.

00:43:17.804 --> 00:43:19.305
I don't think they give a shit!

00:43:19.806 --> 00:43:22.600
How 'bout we plaster up a big sign?
"Government Operation!"

00:43:23.518 --> 00:43:26.896
If there's a patrol boat, they'll take
one look at the sign and turn around.

00:43:26.979 --> 00:43:29.398
The kid's right.
You all should pay attention.

00:43:29.482 --> 00:43:32.568
What's a thief say when the cops
catch him climbing over a wall?

00:43:32.652 --> 00:43:36.155
"You damn pig! I'll take you down
before you take me in! Just try me!"

00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:38.991
We might as well go all out.
Get the villagers working on it.

00:43:39.867 --> 00:43:43.162
Yeah, if we didn't spend so much time
rounding folks up for grunt work,

00:43:43.246 --> 00:43:44.664
plus loading and unloading everything,

00:43:44.747 --> 00:43:45.748
we could work faster.

00:43:45.832 --> 00:43:46.833
So?

00:43:47.333 --> 00:43:48.417
Uncle, you make the call.

00:43:50.878 --> 00:43:52.922
You already did all the talking, kid.

00:43:56.425 --> 00:43:58.302
No one's thinking what this'll cost.

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:09.814
Why'd you cover for us back there?

00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:12.859
No point in half-assing something.

00:44:12.942 --> 00:44:14.652
Gotta admit, it's unexpected.

00:44:15.361 --> 00:44:17.864
But I am glad.
Now you're thinking straight.

00:44:18.614 --> 00:44:19.991
I want my exact share.

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:21.951
No rounding it down to 10 mil.

00:44:22.034 --> 00:44:23.828
- All right, fine.
- And also,

00:44:23.911 --> 00:44:26.122
this'll be the last job
we do together, Uncle.

00:44:26.789 --> 00:44:27.957
You've changed.

00:44:28.624 --> 00:44:29.625
Too much.

00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:38.759
HEUNGBAEK CORPORATION INC.

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:45.141
Good afternoon.

00:44:45.224 --> 00:44:46.225
Good afternoon.

00:44:47.143 --> 00:44:48.144
Sit down.

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.398
I know you're all busy,

00:44:52.481 --> 00:44:54.483
so I want to thank you
for making the time today.

00:44:55.026 --> 00:44:57.403
The newly appointed executives
here with us.

00:44:57.486 --> 00:44:59.989
Every one of you has been with the company
for over 15 years.

00:45:00.615 --> 00:45:02.825
So I'm sure you're well aware
of the situation.

00:45:02.909 --> 00:45:04.911
How's
the chairman's condition?

00:45:06.245 --> 00:45:08.206
Unfortunately, he's still unwell.

00:45:08.873 --> 00:45:10.124
No improvements, then.

00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:11.584
Not at this point, no.

00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:15.755
I want the chairman's worsening condition
to be kept from the public.

00:45:15.838 --> 00:45:17.048
That means no press.

00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:18.549
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:45:19.467 --> 00:45:21.427
I'm sure the news of these
sudden appointments

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:23.054
were a surprise to all of you.

00:45:24.347 --> 00:45:25.973
It was unconventional.

00:45:26.766 --> 00:45:29.894
Did the decision really come
from the chairman himself?

00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:32.063
Do you disagree with it?

00:45:32.855 --> 00:45:34.357
No, it's not that.

00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:38.069
You don't have to accept the position.
We have plenty of candidates.

00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:40.071
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

00:45:41.614 --> 00:45:43.449
I took note of what the chairman had said.

00:45:43.991 --> 00:45:45.201
I'll read it for you.

00:45:50.039 --> 00:45:52.667
"The Heungbaek Corporation
is facing an unseen

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.710
and herefore unprecedented challenge."

00:45:54.794 --> 00:45:55.878
"And never before,

00:45:55.962 --> 00:45:59.173
have we experienced the resignation
of all executives at once."

00:45:59.257 --> 00:46:01.217
"Nor have we left these positions vacant."

00:46:01.842 --> 00:46:05.179
"So starting now, we'll make a fresh start
with a forward thinking structure,

00:46:05.263 --> 00:46:06.639
and a more future oriented..."

00:46:06.722 --> 00:46:08.641
What did you find on Jeonchul?

00:46:08.724 --> 00:46:10.643
Well, before that,

00:46:10.726 --> 00:46:14.230
can you go into detail
about the nature of your relationship?

00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:15.523
That's not important.

00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:18.734
I mean,
I barely had to dig to find it out.

00:46:18.818 --> 00:46:21.445
I don't recall that being
what I asked you to look into.

00:46:21.529 --> 00:46:24.198
Tell me how long
the chairman has known about Jeonchul.

00:46:25.283 --> 00:46:28.619
Right, well last year,
he was investigated by the company.

00:46:28.703 --> 00:46:31.330
Including the deep-sea fishing company
he worked for.

00:46:32.206 --> 00:46:34.917
And that's when he found out
we were married, isn't it?

00:46:35.001 --> 00:46:36.252
Yeah, I bet it is.

00:46:38.838 --> 00:46:41.632
Why dig into someone
who wasn't even in the country?

00:46:41.716 --> 00:46:43.050
"Wasn't in the country"?

00:46:43.551 --> 00:46:44.885
Busan's right here.

00:46:44.969 --> 00:46:46.262
Busan?

00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:49.974
That's where we know he was living
before he hit the road to Seoul.

00:46:50.057 --> 00:46:51.475
He was there the whole time.

00:46:52.268 --> 00:46:55.229
He's got a wife who does alterations,
and a boy in elementary school.

00:46:55.313 --> 00:46:57.189
- A wife and a son?
- Yeah.

00:46:57.773 --> 00:46:59.608
He wasn't really doing much of anything.

00:46:59.692 --> 00:47:02.528
I mean, he just bummed around,
never really held down a job.

00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:03.696
Wait just a minute.

00:47:03.779 --> 00:47:06.490
He said he was on an island
in the middle of the Indian Ocean.

00:47:06.574 --> 00:47:07.867
He was just lying to you.

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:11.245
It was about a month after he was rescued.
He came back here.

00:47:15.291 --> 00:47:19.045
By the way, uh... I don't know
where he is. He vanished into thin air.

00:47:20.379 --> 00:47:21.630
You know where he could be?

00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:23.674
Detective.

00:47:24.175 --> 00:47:28.262
Let's say... you found out
there was a hit out on someone.

00:47:29.096 --> 00:47:31.515
What type of proof
would you need, exactly?

00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:34.685
Uh... What are you talking about?

00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:36.979
If someone had
someone else killed,

00:47:37.063 --> 00:47:39.690
what type of proof would one need
to bring to you?

00:47:40.232 --> 00:47:44.320
Well, like a confession,
or evidence, or a witness.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:54.038
Jeonchul. He may have been murdered.
That what you're saying?

00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:01.879
Food poisoning?

00:48:01.962 --> 00:48:04.548
Yeah. Guess he had
some bad bread at school.

00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:07.301
Wait, why are you buying him school lunch?

00:48:07.385 --> 00:48:09.637
- You got money to burn?
- It wasn't that.

00:48:10.137 --> 00:48:11.430
A friend of his gave him a piece.

00:48:11.514 --> 00:48:13.015
What is he, a beggar?

00:48:13.099 --> 00:48:15.059
How much does the lunch program
cost per month?

00:48:15.142 --> 00:48:17.520
Why are you getting angry?
Boys are like this.

00:48:17.603 --> 00:48:19.980
Bullshit, he's a damn idiot.

00:48:20.064 --> 00:48:21.482
What'd he place on his exams?

00:48:22.316 --> 00:48:25.444
Uh... He placed 30th.

00:48:25.528 --> 00:48:27.863
He's pulling that shit while I'm out here
working my ass off,

00:48:27.947 --> 00:48:29.657
putting food on the table?

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.909
Tell him I'm gonna whoop his ass
with a cane when I get there.

00:48:31.992 --> 00:48:35.204
Oh, stop. He's working hard,
he's doing his best. Ease off.

00:48:35.287 --> 00:48:36.831
Can't you do better with the kids?

00:48:36.914 --> 00:48:38.749
You're making things so much harder on me.

00:48:38.833 --> 00:48:41.752
- All you do is spend my money.
- I work my butt off here!

00:48:41.836 --> 00:48:43.712
And being a working mother
isn't easy, you know.

00:48:43.796 --> 00:48:44.880
Watch your fucking...

00:48:46.006 --> 00:48:48.259
I'm sending you a 100K for Minji.

00:48:48.342 --> 00:48:49.427
Don't blow it.

00:48:50.094 --> 00:48:51.387
100,000?

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:52.471
Gotta go.

00:48:52.555 --> 00:48:54.014
'Kay.

00:48:57.893 --> 00:49:00.104
How you feeling? You okay?

00:49:00.187 --> 00:49:02.398
BUSAN ULTIMATE POWER GYM
COACH KIM HYEONJUN

00:49:11.824 --> 00:49:13.117
Nicely done!

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:14.827
So great!

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:16.036
Good work, guys!

00:49:17.204 --> 00:49:18.205
You having fun?

00:49:21.876 --> 00:49:22.877
Hey.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.879
My ma, tell me how you cheated her.

00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:26.297
I didn't do that to her.

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:29.091
- We were both taken for a ride.
- Stop lying, you squirrely fuck.

00:49:29.175 --> 00:49:31.552
Fine, I will, just stop doing that!

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:33.888
Then cut the bullshit already.

00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:37.141
Hey, think I can bum a cigarette?

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:51.572
"WRESTLING IS OUR TRADITION"

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:55.951
Here's the truth.

00:49:56.035 --> 00:49:58.829
You see, I did swipe some pottery.

00:49:58.913 --> 00:50:01.999
Your mom held onto it.
Then I brought in this buyer.

00:50:02.082 --> 00:50:04.710
This guy was just eating
out of my hand, right?

00:50:04.793 --> 00:50:07.087
He believed when I said they were genuine.

00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:08.839
So I'd walk into your mom's shop,

00:50:08.923 --> 00:50:11.634
and be like, "Everything here to there,

00:50:11.717 --> 00:50:14.178
we'll take it all,
and here's the price we'll take it at,"

00:50:14.261 --> 00:50:18.349
and just like that the buyer thinks
he's working with an ace negotiator.

00:50:18.432 --> 00:50:21.602
And why would my ma
go along with all this? With you?

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:24.605
{\an8}'Cause she was getting
a big ass kickback from it.

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:26.732
{\an8}You saying my ma took a bribe? That it?

00:50:26.815 --> 00:50:30.402
Well, I might've called it a storage fee,
but she knew what it was.

00:50:30.486 --> 00:50:32.321
Your ma was getting a sweet deal.

00:50:32.404 --> 00:50:34.156
Shut the hell up, motherfucker.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.242
Call it whatever you want,
it's still some shady shit.

00:50:36.325 --> 00:50:38.536
Okay, okay! You're right about everything!

00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:40.621
Then what'd you do with the money?

00:50:41.497 --> 00:50:43.582
There was never any.
We were making a trade.

00:50:43.666 --> 00:50:44.750
What'd he trade?

00:50:47.002 --> 00:50:49.129
- A gun.
- The one you had?

00:50:49.213 --> 00:50:52.800
That thing was worth over five mil
'cause it was made of gold, all right?

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.385
- Huh? Geez.
- Wh-What?

00:50:54.468 --> 00:50:55.844
You're saying 5 million for that gun?

00:50:55.928 --> 00:50:58.639
You're kidding.
Coach, should we go get it?

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:00.724
You really believe
it's still there, you idiot?

00:51:00.808 --> 00:51:03.269
Ugh, no! Five million!
And we left it there?

00:51:03.352 --> 00:51:05.771
- What the fuck man, this is insane.
- Stop!

00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:11.860
Tell me, where'd you get
the fake pottery, then?

00:51:12.528 --> 00:51:16.615
Uh... Choi, a customs officer,
that son of a bitch.

00:51:16.699 --> 00:51:18.701
- Then let's deal with that prick first.
- Yeah.

00:51:18.784 --> 00:51:20.286
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey! What?

00:51:20.369 --> 00:51:22.079
- I'm going too?
- Well, yeah.

00:51:22.162 --> 00:51:24.290
Wait, that'll get weird.

00:51:24.373 --> 00:51:25.791
You guys go without me.

00:51:25.874 --> 00:51:27.001
I'll stay right here.

00:51:27.084 --> 00:51:29.795
You outta your mind? How are
we gonna find this guy without you?

00:51:29.878 --> 00:51:32.798
- We don't know what he looks like.
- He's gonna run if I'm there, 'kay?

00:51:32.881 --> 00:51:34.133
Makes everything much harder.

00:51:35.175 --> 00:51:38.929
Oh, and he's a civil servant.
So don't be too rough. All right?

00:51:39.013 --> 00:51:41.974
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

00:51:42.057 --> 00:51:43.058
Get going now.

00:51:47.438 --> 00:51:50.107
How's the chairman these days?
Is he getting any better?

00:51:50.608 --> 00:51:52.192
We're not out of the woods yet.

00:51:52.276 --> 00:51:55.863
- But we're seeing some improvements.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry to hear that.

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:58.073
So, what made you want
to meet so suddenly?

00:51:58.157 --> 00:51:59.700
I'm sure you have a specific reason.

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:02.870
Mrs. Yang, there's a big issue...

00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:06.457
Running government affairs...
It takes a whole lot of money, you see.

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.918
The chairman gave me access
to one of his safes in his absence.

00:52:10.502 --> 00:52:13.005
And he's been putting money
for my expenses in there.

00:52:13.088 --> 00:52:15.299
But for a while now,
there's been nothing inside.

00:52:15.382 --> 00:52:16.383
You said safes?

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:19.219
The ones at Ilwol Credit Union?

00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:20.304
Well, yeah.

00:52:20.387 --> 00:52:22.681
The Chairman gave you access
to one of his safes?

00:52:22.765 --> 00:52:23.891
Right, that's what I said.

00:52:24.892 --> 00:52:28.437
Ah, having to explain all of this to you,
I'm a bit embarrassed.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.440
Oh, Assemblyman Kim,
please don't be embarrassed.

00:52:31.523 --> 00:52:33.067
Happy to make things right with you.

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:35.402
Thank you. It's much appreciated.

00:52:37.613 --> 00:52:40.366
I was gonna say,
these days, with everything going on,

00:52:40.449 --> 00:52:41.784
there's just so much to pay for.

00:52:41.867 --> 00:52:43.160
Yes, I'm sure!

00:52:43.243 --> 00:52:45.871
I'll help you get your access,
absolutely no issue.

00:52:45.954 --> 00:52:48.290
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

00:52:48.374 --> 00:52:49.500
Would you care for some bread?

00:52:49.583 --> 00:52:53.128
Ah, this bread is just...

00:52:53.212 --> 00:52:56.674
Now that you mention it...
Is that safe only used for funds?

00:52:56.757 --> 00:52:57.800
That's right.

00:52:57.883 --> 00:52:59.843
I'm the only one with access to that one.

00:53:00.511 --> 00:53:02.471
He actually has three of them in there.

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.182
There's one key for all three safes.

00:53:05.265 --> 00:53:07.393
- Oh.
- And mine is the third one.

00:53:08.686 --> 00:53:11.605
One time I accidentally opened
the second safe instead,

00:53:11.689 --> 00:53:14.149
and these seals were inside.

00:53:14.233 --> 00:53:15.526
- Seals?
- Yeah.

00:53:15.609 --> 00:53:16.819
Which number was it?

00:53:17.736 --> 00:53:18.904
I think I remember...

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:22.866
51. The one I use is 83.

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:23.992
I see.

00:53:24.493 --> 00:53:27.955
I'll go check myself. And fill it with
enough funds for all of your expenses.

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:30.541
Oh, geez, I appreciate it so much.

00:53:31.709 --> 00:53:33.711
And the bread. Wow, you should try it!

00:53:34.336 --> 00:53:35.379
Help yourself.

00:53:35.462 --> 00:53:37.631
- Here, here, have some.
- Thanks.

00:53:37.715 --> 00:53:39.049
It's delicious.

{\an8}Mr. Choi,
antiques are your specialty, aren't they?

00:53:49.518 --> 00:53:54.606
Uh... What's this all about?

00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:56.942
You know the Professor.

00:53:57.443 --> 00:54:00.446
That asshole scammed my ma
with some fake pottery

00:54:00.529 --> 00:54:04.241
and he told me that he got the goods
from you. Is that true, Mr. Choi?

00:54:04.867 --> 00:54:08.162
I wouldn't know, because I'm not
involved in anything like that.

00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:11.415
You're the go-between for Japan.

00:54:11.498 --> 00:54:12.875
You seize smuggled goods

00:54:12.958 --> 00:54:15.043
and then you sell them
under the table. Right?

00:54:19.047 --> 00:54:21.425
You should just fuck off!

00:54:22.593 --> 00:54:23.594
Punk ass...

00:54:23.677 --> 00:54:27.014
You must've lost your mind
if you're yelling in front of your work.

00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:29.641
And here we are,
trying to avoid a damn scene.

00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:32.686
The Professor told us you made a fortune

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:35.481
when you gave him
those garbage fakes, you asshole!

00:54:36.815 --> 00:54:38.776
Give me the cash you got off of this shit.

00:54:38.859 --> 00:54:40.444
I don't have any cash.

00:54:40.527 --> 00:54:41.862
You motherfucker!

00:54:42.654 --> 00:54:44.698
You're a damn civil servant,

00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:48.368
and all you've got to show for it
is a history of scamming? Eh?

00:54:48.911 --> 00:54:51.288
You've been raking in easy money,
haven't you?

00:54:51.872 --> 00:54:55.125
If you don't wanna lose this cushy job,
just come up off the dough.

00:54:55.751 --> 00:54:57.252
- Ah, shit.
- All right?

00:55:00.506 --> 00:55:04.343
Oh, man, you sure got a lot of stuff here.

00:55:04.426 --> 00:55:06.345
Where'd they go to get the barge anyway?

00:55:06.428 --> 00:55:08.597
- They're going to Mokpo for it.
- Mokpo?

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:11.016
There they are. There.

00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:14.895
- Oh, yeah.
- That's it? That's tiny.

00:55:15.479 --> 00:55:19.066
Wait, what's that?
Right there, what's it say on it?

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:20.609
- Huh?
- Don't ask me that.

00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:23.695
Uh, what does it say?

00:55:23.779 --> 00:55:27.741
"Sinan..." something...
"Offshore..." Wait, wait.

00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:32.120
- "Cultural Relics. Salvage Operation."
- Wow. No kidding.

00:55:32.204 --> 00:55:36.542
Wow. So that means
this is a government project, huh?

00:55:36.625 --> 00:55:39.628
In that case, we're gonna
make some real cash here!

00:55:39.711 --> 00:55:41.838
- Hot diggity dang!
- Oh, absolutely!

00:55:47.553 --> 00:55:49.388
Now it's time for all or nothing.

00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:53.100
When have we have ever gotten all?
It's always nothing.

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:54.810
- What?
- All!

00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:56.311
"All!"

00:55:57.396 --> 00:55:59.606
Well then, lets grab
all of it this time, boys!
