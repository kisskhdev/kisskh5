WEBVTT

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:04.982
Law and The City

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.484
CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:09.987
ALL CHILD ACTORS FILMED SAFELY
WITH PARENTAL SUPERVISION

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:20.956
You haven't eaten yet, right?

00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:24.418
Hey, bring some food over here too!

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:25.502
Okay.

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.507
Did he have any health issues?

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:31.675
No.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.344
He was always in great health.

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.513
I never thought he'd pass
so suddenly like this.

00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:43.729
Please eat.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:48.775
He seems to have a big family.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.819
No, they're all his neighbors.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.905
He has one son, but he's in the US.

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:58.201
So everyone's eager to stand in
as the chief mourner until he gets here.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.787
So the townspeople prepared all of this?

00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:01.913
Yes.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:07.461
There's not a single person in this town
who didn't get help from Mr. Park.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.463
Even if it weren't his problem,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.884
he'd diligently go around and make sure
everyone was taken care of.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.470
If it weren't for Mr. Park,

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.514
I wouldn't have even thought of
getting our family's land back.

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:22.267
I don't even know
where the land starts and ends.

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:27.147
The land that was taken
is even bigger than what you thought.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.440
What?

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:31.735
We found a land register
from the Japanese occupation period.

00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:35.113
Everything past the stream
was owned by Han Insu

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:38.617
- Even that part beyond it was ours?
- Yes.

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:41.912
But what does it matter now?

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:45.874
Mr. Park is gone now,
and there's no one left to fight for it.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.252
Enjoy your food before you go.

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:53.423
And thank you
for hearing Mr. Park out.

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:04.518
He must've been a really good person.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:13.568
I quit. Find yourself another associate.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.328
What do you think you're doing?

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:26.289
Exactly what I just said.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:30.752
Fine. Don't take Jang Sugil's case.

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:31.837
No, sir.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.756
This isn't just about this one case.

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:38.009
I've thought about it for a long time.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.804
I…

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.015
can't keep working here anymore.

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.188
What is this all of a sudden?

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.692
Is this law firm a joke to you?

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.244
Goodness.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.581
You can't just do this all of a sudden.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.875
Resignations must have a period of notice.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.961
We need to hire a replacement,
handover duties, and follow protocol--

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:16.089
Did you follow that protocol
when you hired me?

00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:18.049
You didn't even give me a proper contract.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:21.845
So that's what you were upset about.
Goodness.

00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:25.432
Okay, let's talk this out like lawyers.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:26.558
Here, have a seat.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:35.400
All right, then.

00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:38.737
Stay until we hire someone new.
Just until then.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.155
I don't want to.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.449
Well…

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:45.160
So you do have a backbone, Attorney Cho.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:46.745
Fine. Then…

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.416
Just give me 10 days.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.382
- One week.
- Okay, one week. Thanks.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:00.550
Okay.

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.828
HELLO, MS. BAE MUNJEONG
HERE IS THE INTERVIEW SCHEDULE

00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:30.247
IN-HOUSE COUNSEL POSITION

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:56.147
CERTIFICATE OF SCHOLARSHIP
GWANGSEONG LAW SCHOOL, HA SANGGI

DANDELION SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION
CHAIRMAN KIM HYUNGMIN

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:06.157
You must've had a rough time, Attorney Ha.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.338
I don't think
Ms. Kim gave you the case

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:23.466
just to use extenuating circumstances
and reduce his sentence.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.469
It's a student from her foundation,
so she's more invested.

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.389
- Are you joining us today?
- I'd like to take the class as well.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.391
Is that okay?

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:32.893
Are you going to apply
for the PhD?

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:35.395
This? No, it's nothing.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.314
I say go for it.
I'm very much for it.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.107
Professor, you got this!

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.784
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN
ADVISOR KIM HYUNGMIN

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:52.162
Come in.

00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:01.671
- Attorney Ha.
- Hello, Ms. Kim.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.132
- Have a seat.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.844
What brings you here?

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:13.558
So…

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:15.852
The foundation

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.437
that you oversee…

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.649
It's the Dandelion Scholarship Foundation,
right?

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:23.902
Yes, that's right.

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.112
Where did you hear that from?

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.662
It seems you didn't hear it in passing.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.339
Thanks to you,

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.549
I was able to graduate from law school

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.760
without needing to take a single break.

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:50.887
It was the first time in my life

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.349
where I could focus on studying
and not worry about anything else.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.393
Thank you so much.

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:00.271
If it wasn't for your support,

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.691
I couldn't have even dreamed of this.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.820
I didn't realize you were so close.
I'm sorry it took so long to thank you.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:09.322
I'm truly grateful.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.086
Gosh, please sit.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:31.177
Just seeing you doing well
made me the grateful one.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.432
- You knew all along?
- Of course.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:39.477
I was so happy when I heard
you worked at a firm in our building.

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.230
Then, you should've told me.

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:44.190
Tell you for what?

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:46.651
I'm someone you didn't need to know.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.028
Gosh.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.824
I thought I always had in mind
all the people who had helped me,

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:55.577
but not being able to
recognize you like this…

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.455
I'm ashamed.
There's so much I need to repay.

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.623
You don't owe me a thing.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:04.711
Just keep doing well like you are now.
That's how you repay me.

00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:14.262
Goodness. By the way,

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:17.515
just like you once did for me,

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:20.435
I've found someone I want to help out.

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.147
He grew up in an orphanage,

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.400
and I want to financially support him,
so he can go to college.

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:29.152
But I don't want him
to know it's from me,

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.905
so I'd like to do it
through your foundation.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:34.282
So you have someone in mind?

00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:36.826
Then, our foundation
will take care of the funds.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.995
No, I want to do that.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:44.209
And well…
I have a bit of money now, Ms. Kim.

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:48.797
Honestly,

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:53.510
I didn't know why I was so persistent
in saving money all this time.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.097
But I want to put it to good use.

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:03.478
All right. Let's do that.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:09.234
Goodness.

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.861
It's hot in here.

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:16.116
{\an8}ATTORNEY HA SANGGI

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:37.804
Let's just drop that case.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:39.889
I looked over the land documents,

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.224
and if we go through everything,

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:45.395
just the filing and delivery fees alone
would cost tens of millions of won.

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:47.522
So things actually worked out.

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.234
Even though Mr. Park is gone,

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.736
the clients are all still here.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.655
We're fully capable of handling it.

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:59.951
But didn't you say there could be tons
of plaintiffs and defendants?

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:01.578
It'll get out of hand and drag on.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.746
It'll probably take years to see through.

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:05.915
We never should've taken it on.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.917
- Just let it go.
- Yes, sir.

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:11.713
I figured you'd say that.

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:39.449
Do you only do things for your gain?

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.743
If I don't do this, who will?

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.622
Someone's got to do it,
so that's why I'm doing it.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:55.340
Since the burden of proof
lies with the plaintiff,

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.342
and because she has not provided…

00:11:58.426 --> 00:11:59.969
evidence to overcome this…

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.514
we request the court
to dismiss this claim.

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:06.142
You were never bothered
by this kind of stuff.

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:08.645
It had always bothered me.

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:11.022
I just got used to the discomfort.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:19.364
Attorney Ahn, should I clear out
the maps in the meeting room?

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:24.452
Don't throw them out.
Bring them to my office.

00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:25.536
Okay, sir.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.247
Also…

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:31.834
could you bring me the files
on Shin Jihye from the Deus GA case?

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:33.002
Okay.

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.671
ATTORNEY KANG HUIJI

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:44.055
DEFENDANT
JEONG SUNJA

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:55.275
Let's go.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.321
We'll begin with the case ruling.

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:04.951
Criminal case number 2025-7430.

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:06.244
The charge of murder.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.330
Defendant Jeong Sunja.

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:36.983
We will now deliver the ruling.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:39.027
The verdict.

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.154
Defendant, Jeong Sunja,

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:43.948
is sentenced to three years in prison.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.370
COUNSEL'S SEAT, DEFENDANT'S SEAT

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:54.375
However,

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.046
this sentence will be suspended

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:02.008
for five years
from the date of this ruling.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.232
Thank you…

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:21.486
for listening to me,

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:23.237
Attorney Kang.

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:54.811
{\an8}Episode 12
See You in Seocho-dong

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.159
{\an8}I've decided to quit my firm.

00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:17.542
I applied to become a prosecutor.

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.252
I'm going to start studying for the exam.

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:21.295
- Prosecutor?
- Yeah.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:23.673
You used to hate prosecutors.
Why all of a sudden?

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:26.551
That's exactly the reason why.

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:28.886
I'll become the type of prosecutor
I don't hate.

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:31.305
When did you start thinking about this?

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:32.515
It hasn't been that long.

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:36.310
But once the thought hit me,
I couldn't do this job anymore.

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:39.897
You'll do great. It suits you.

00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:42.316
Thanks. I knew I could count on you.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.322
You guys have nothing to say?

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:49.907
Well? Are you upset?

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:52.326
"Prosecutor Cho Changwon"
doesn't really thrill me.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.619
Exactly.

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:55.621
He'd be a pain to deal with in court.

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:59.041
But your boss
didn't say anything about this?

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:01.961
He gave me so much flak when I quit.

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.338
So what if he does?
It's my decision to leave.

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:06.757
So when are you staying until?

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:10.178
Until this week.

00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:13.389
That soon?

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:14.473
Yeah.

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:15.600
It just worked out that way.

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:18.394
I applied for a PhD program.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:20.938
You finally went for it?

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:22.315
- Yeah.
- Wait…

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.193
- So you had wanted to be a professor?
- Yeah.

00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:29.739
You taught the interns with such effort.
I guess it suited you.

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:36.370
- Then, what about work?
- Yeah. I don't think I can stay.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.500
You're quitting too?

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:43.920
Well, my professor said

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:48.341
if I studied and worked at the same time,
I wouldn't be selected.

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:52.845
I have an interview tomorrow.

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:56.766
- What interview?
- It's for an in-house counsel opening.

00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:58.476
If I get it, I'll switch jobs.

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.604
When I think about having a kid,

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:05.274
I don't think I can keep working here.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.944
So they didn't allow
the maternity leave after all?

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:09.904
Well, that too.

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:12.114
But even after I have the baby,

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.784
the benefits as in-house counsel
are way better.

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:17.286
There would be way less overtime too.

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.121
But you struggled with corporate life.

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:20.706
That's why you came here.

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:23.751
Better me than the baby.

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:26.587
But I heard it's super competitive.

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:29.006
So if I don't get it,
I can't leave even if I wanted to.

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.760
I'd just have to quit then.

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:39.934
Goodness.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:42.436
This won't do.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.022
Ma'am, could we get
a bottle of soju, please?

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.232
Okay.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.492
I guess everyone had
a lot on their minds.

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:06.502
Actually, there's something
I wasn't able to say earlier too.

00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:08.921
What is it?

00:18:10.673 --> 00:18:14.510
I've been thinking about
becoming a public defender.

00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:16.887
A public defender?

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:21.267
I had a thought cross my mind
while working on Jeong Sunja's case.

00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:24.812
If no one had listened to her,

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:27.356
she might have received
a much harsher sentence.

00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:29.859
Without a court-appointed counsel,

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:32.445
she would've had no chance
to tell her story to anyone.

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:35.489
Not everyone will be like her
in court-appointed cases though.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:39.243
There are plenty of shameless
and violent criminals too.

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.913
I know. I'm sure there are.

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:47.710
But I want to help people
like Jeong Sunja,

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:51.756
and the only way to do that
is to be a public defender.

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:56.636
It might be a lot harder than you think.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:02.266
You become emotionally invested
in your clients.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:06.437
And you'd do the same
for even the unforgivable ones.

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.528
I just worry it'll be too hard on you.

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:29.251
Actually, I have something to say too.

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:53.234
{\an8}2025 IN-HOUSE COUNSEL INTERVIEW NOTICE

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:08.374
- Ms. Bae Munjeong?
- Yes.

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.626
- Come this way, please.
- Okay.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.713
RESUME

00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:17.049
You've worked in the public sector

00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:19.677
and also spent a few years
at a private company.

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:23.264
You've done litigation too.

00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:26.142
- Yes, that's correct.
- What made you go into litigation?

00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:33.816
I wanted to meet clients in person
and gain experience in trials.

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:37.445
Then, why do you want to become
an in-house counsel?

00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:40.865
After doing litigation,

00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:44.368
I think corporate work suits me best.

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:46.912
I want to give it another shot.

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.333
Law Group Hyungmin.

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:54.295
It looks like it wasn't a big firm.

00:20:55.546 --> 00:20:57.131
That must've been very tough.

00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:59.592
You would've had to deal
with every person directly.

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:04.388
Excuse me for being late.

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:06.724
I'm Attorney Bae Munjeong
with Law Group Hyungmin.

00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:10.603
Attorney Bae,
please do what you can for her.

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:14.940
Let's get that joy back.

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:19.612
I'm sure dealing
with a lot of people can be difficult.

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:21.363
Yes, it can.

00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:23.991
You won't have that here.

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:25.409
There's no work outside the office,

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.953
and you won't always
have to do new things.

00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:33.417
You just need to stick to a routine
and get along with everyone here.

00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:37.338
Okay. That sounds great.

00:21:38.339 --> 00:21:39.340
We're looking for

00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:41.842
someone who will stay long-term.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.596
Yes, I'm looking for a place
where I can stay long-term too.

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:52.478
That sounds great.

00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:56.524
Do you have any final thoughts
you'd like to share?

00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:31.350
No.

00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:33.727
I don't think you'll need to get in touch.

00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:36.480
- Sorry?
- The truth is,

00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:38.107
I actually like litigation.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.319
I like meeting people and going to trials.

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:45.948
And I love taking on new cases every time.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.202
I think that kind of work
matters to me more.

00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:55.124
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

00:22:55.833 --> 00:22:56.834
Wait…

00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:50.846
What?

00:23:55.225 --> 00:23:56.268
How did it go?

00:23:57.353 --> 00:23:59.229
- How did what go?
- Your interview.

00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:08.572
I'm not taking the job.

00:24:12.076 --> 00:24:13.494
I said I'm not taking the job.

00:24:18.207 --> 00:24:19.291
You're not, right?

00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:23.087
Okay, good job!

00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:26.423
Why are you so happy?
You didn't want me to take the job?

00:24:26.507 --> 00:24:29.259
No, because it wasn't
the type of work you wanted to do.

00:24:33.013 --> 00:24:34.306
That's right.

00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:37.226
Did I do a good job?

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:39.853
Yeah, you did a really great job.

00:24:39.937 --> 00:24:41.313
You did an amazing job.

00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:43.440
Let's eat.

00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:45.901
- I want some water.
- Sure.

00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:59.915
Here's your water.

00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:05.629
Are you crying?

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.841
Thanks.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.051
What?

00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:13.887
Thank you.

00:25:24.106 --> 00:25:25.733
What an ugly face you're making.

00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:33.824
Thank you!

00:25:33.907 --> 00:25:38.078
Hey, you wanted to eat.
Why are you crying? Let's eat.

00:25:38.162 --> 00:25:39.913
- All your favorite dishes, right?
- Yeah.

00:25:44.043 --> 00:25:47.963
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:25:53.594 --> 00:25:55.387

HELLO, I'M A LAWYER AND A NEWBIE MOM

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:07.793
I'm a lawyer and newbie mom who's raising
a six-month-old while on leave.

00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:09.586
That's right. Eat up.

00:27:10.546 --> 00:27:13.841
After six months, my husband
will be taking a year of parental leave,

00:27:13.924 --> 00:27:16.510
so I'm looking for a one-year position.

00:27:16.593 --> 00:27:18.679
I haven't found anything that lines up.

00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:21.140
Are there any other moms
in the same field here?

00:27:23.225 --> 00:27:24.852
WORKING AS A PARENTAL LEAVE TEMP

00:27:24.935 --> 00:27:29.606
{\an8}I worked as a lawyer at a law firm
and took a break after giving birth.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:32.276
{\an8}Right now, I'm working
as a parental leave temp.

00:27:32.818 --> 00:27:36.822
My contract will end
right when my child starts daycare,

00:27:36.905 --> 00:27:39.074
so that should make it easier
for them to adjust.

00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:41.702
How long does it take for kids
to get used to daycare?

LAWYER MOM PREPARING FOR SECOND BABY

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:46.582
I've already forgotten
how hard the first one was.

00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:48.667
I can't believe I'm planning for a second.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.794
Luckily, the results are good.

00:27:50.878 --> 00:27:52.880
We'll be doing egg retrieval in two weeks.

00:27:52.963 --> 00:27:54.506
I'm worried I won't find a place

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:58.719
{\an8}where I can work for just a year
before my first child enters school.

00:27:58.802 --> 00:28:00.262
{\an8}But I'm sure things will work out.

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:04.224
{\an8}By any chance, are there any lawyers here
looking for a parental leave temp?

00:28:05.601 --> 00:28:06.643
SEND A NOTE

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:10.314
Hello, I'm an associate attorney
about to go on maternity leave,

00:28:10.397 --> 00:28:13.317
and I'm currently looking
for a temp to cover my position.

00:28:19.031 --> 00:28:20.782
You must be Mr. Kwon Gukjin.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:22.451
Yes, I am.

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:26.204
You don't have to be too nervous.
What brings you in today?

00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:31.793
One of our new employees

00:28:31.877 --> 00:28:34.504
reported me for sexual harassment.

00:28:37.966 --> 00:28:39.801
Could you explain the situation?

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.889
Well, we had a welcome dinner

00:28:44.514 --> 00:28:46.099
for the new hire.

00:28:46.183 --> 00:28:50.062
And somehow,
she ended up sitting next to me.

00:28:50.896 --> 00:28:51.897
But…

00:28:53.482 --> 00:28:58.028
she's saying I touched her thigh
under the table and reported me.

00:29:00.364 --> 00:29:02.866
Did you accidentally
touch her thigh by any chance?

00:29:03.492 --> 00:29:05.494
No, I didn't accidentally touch her.

00:29:09.206 --> 00:29:11.500
PLAINTIFF SUFFERED HUMILIATION
AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:13.043
{\an8}REQUESTS PUNISHMENT AGAINST DEFENDANT

00:29:13.126 --> 00:29:14.336
{\an8}I just touched her.

00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:17.464
Excuse me?

00:29:19.091 --> 00:29:20.842
It wasn't an accident. I touched her.

00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:30.060
Then, are you admitting to the charges?

00:29:30.143 --> 00:29:31.853
Yes. It's true that I did it.

00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:38.860
Then,

00:29:39.987 --> 00:29:42.406
you must be seeking a lighter punishment.

00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:47.494
Is this your first offense?

00:29:49.162 --> 00:29:50.789
By that, do you mean

00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:53.917
the first time I've ever touched someone,

00:29:54.001 --> 00:29:56.420
or the first time
I've been caught and punished?

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:00.215
I've never been caught or punished before.

00:30:02.718 --> 00:30:05.804
There's no CCTV there,
and it was under the table,

00:30:05.887 --> 00:30:07.264
so no one could've seen it.

00:30:07.764 --> 00:30:10.517
I'm hoping I can get off this time too.

00:30:11.184 --> 00:30:12.269
It'll be possible, right?

00:30:13.854 --> 00:30:16.857
I've never been caught before,
but it'd be weird

00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:18.692
if it were to happen this time.

00:30:34.708 --> 00:30:37.461
PRESIDENT KIM

00:30:42.215 --> 00:30:43.216
Hello?

00:30:55.187 --> 00:30:57.814
You just happened
to be passing by my office again?

00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:00.275
Yeah, that's right.

00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:03.111
You showed up right on time.

00:31:05.072 --> 00:31:06.073
For what?

00:31:08.492 --> 00:31:09.493
It's nothing.

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:12.954
What is it? Tell me.

00:31:17.459 --> 00:31:19.127
What? Is something on your mind?

00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:28.011
Well, there's something
called a public defender.

00:31:28.095 --> 00:31:29.596
They're appointed by the court

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:34.726
They only handle court-appointed cases
for people who can't afford a lawyer.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.687
Hey, I know what they are.

00:31:39.481 --> 00:31:40.941
Are you thinking of doing it?

00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:42.400
Yeah.

00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:46.154
But I'm wondering
if I'm just thinking too idealistically.

00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:50.492
Do you have to do it?

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:53.829
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Why not?

00:31:55.122 --> 00:31:58.875
I don't like the idea of you
dealing with troubled people all the time.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:04.965
There could also be people like you
who are falsely accused.

00:32:05.048 --> 00:32:06.758
Sure, maybe.

00:32:08.385 --> 00:32:10.554
Maybe I'm just being selfish,

00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:13.056
but I don't want you to do it.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.810
You feel that way too?

00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:20.397
Was there someone else
who said the same thing?

00:32:23.191 --> 00:32:24.192
Yeah.

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:44.045
- Attorney Cho, I'm coming in.
- Yes, come in.

00:32:47.257 --> 00:32:48.258
My goodness.

00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:50.719
Wait, what's all this?

00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:53.930
Mr. Seong wanted you to write up briefs
for each of these cases.

00:32:54.014 --> 00:32:56.266
- All of these?
- Yes.

00:32:59.603 --> 00:33:00.687
Okay, I understand.

00:33:14.034 --> 00:33:16.328
Did you get the cases?
You can do them, right?

00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:18.580
- There's still plenty of time.
- Yes, I can do them.

00:33:20.165 --> 00:33:23.710
You sure do have a backbone, Attorney Cho.

00:33:23.793 --> 00:33:25.378
- Can you check these?
- Sure.

00:33:27.464 --> 00:33:30.634
Also, about the unjust enrichment part…

00:33:36.765 --> 00:33:37.766
Come in.

00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:42.646
Let's settle this today.

00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:45.607
Either I leave or you follow the law.

00:33:47.317 --> 00:33:48.318
What's that?

00:33:48.401 --> 00:33:52.155
Resumes of temps
you didn't even bother looking for.

00:33:53.782 --> 00:33:56.034
I've done this a few times before and--

00:33:56.117 --> 00:33:59.704
Done what?
Everyone probably left on their own.

00:33:59.788 --> 00:34:02.332
But I'm not leaving.
No, I refuse to.

00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:04.125
It's my right. Why should I leave?

00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:05.710
But realistically…

00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:09.172
Realistically,
you can take your pick from here.

00:34:09.256 --> 00:34:13.969
These folks are ready to take my place
per the labor law. That should do, right?

00:34:14.928 --> 00:34:16.054
I'll get going then.

00:34:22.519 --> 00:34:24.145
What is wrong with her?

00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:26.898
COMPLAINT

00:34:28.441 --> 00:34:30.318
DEFENDANT
KWON GUKJIN

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:40.954
I'm hoping I can get off.

00:34:41.037 --> 00:34:44.291
I've never been caught before,
but it'd be weird

00:34:44.374 --> 00:34:45.625
if it were to happen this time.

00:34:50.547 --> 00:34:51.673
DEFENDANT
JEONG SUNJA

00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:52.799
Thank you…

00:34:54.676 --> 00:34:56.219
for listening to me,

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:57.971
Attorney Kang.

00:35:17.365 --> 00:35:19.117
Let's start again by discussing

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:20.952
your admission of the charges.

00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:28.668
Come in.

00:35:30.337 --> 00:35:31.796
Yes, Attorney Ha?

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.049
Ma'am, do you have any plans tonight?

00:35:35.759 --> 00:35:37.344
No. Why?

00:35:37.427 --> 00:35:40.639
If you're free, would you
like to have dinner with me?

00:35:43.016 --> 00:35:44.059
Sure.

00:35:44.643 --> 00:35:46.686
Okay, I'll grab my things
and be right out.

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:47.854
- Okay.
- All right.

00:35:47.937 --> 00:35:49.230
Okay.

00:35:56.613 --> 00:35:57.864
- Try this too.
- Okay.

00:35:57.947 --> 00:35:59.240
- They say it's good.
- You too.

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:04.996
It's really good.

00:36:06.748 --> 00:36:07.749
But…

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.086
why did you suddenly ask to eat dinner?

00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:14.047
I didn't expect
you'd suggest a place like this.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:17.384
Well, it's been a while
since we had a meal together.

00:36:17.467 --> 00:36:20.053
And I've never treated you before either.

00:36:21.805 --> 00:36:22.806
So does that mean

00:36:22.889 --> 00:36:24.891
- you're paying for this?
- Of course.

00:36:31.439 --> 00:36:32.732
Ms. Kim.

00:36:32.816 --> 00:36:35.610
I've decided to apply for the PhD.

00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:37.362
Really?

00:36:37.862 --> 00:36:39.614
That's great!

00:36:40.156 --> 00:36:43.159
So they're allowing you
to work and study at the same time now?

00:36:43.243 --> 00:36:44.244
No.

00:36:45.745 --> 00:36:47.664
What? Then, what happened?

00:36:50.583 --> 00:36:52.877
I think I'll have to resign.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.641
So you're telling me

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.561
that you're quitting?

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.521
Yes.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:16.901
It feels like I'm getting dumped.

00:37:16.985 --> 00:37:18.069
So…

00:37:19.195 --> 00:37:20.739
this was a farewell dinner?

00:37:20.822 --> 00:37:22.031
Well…

00:37:22.782 --> 00:37:26.536
It wasn't meant to be,
but it turned into one. I'm sorry.

00:37:28.788 --> 00:37:30.415
Who throws a farewell like this?

00:37:31.374 --> 00:37:32.500
You're free after this, right?

00:37:39.007 --> 00:37:40.467
Let's just go get a drink.

00:37:42.469 --> 00:37:43.553
Okay.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:46.931
But this…

00:37:47.974 --> 00:37:48.975
But…

00:37:49.809 --> 00:37:52.228
But this was an expensive meal.

00:37:52.312 --> 00:37:53.354
Wait, Ma'am!

00:37:58.234 --> 00:37:59.235
Come in.

00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:04.741
Mr. Park, what's the matter?

00:38:04.824 --> 00:38:07.619
Chairman, we're being audited
at the foundation.

00:38:10.538 --> 00:38:12.749
- Why all of a sudden?
- Someone filed a complaint.

00:38:14.334 --> 00:38:15.752
They'll come here next soon.

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:19.839
A complaint? From who?

00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:25.678
Should I hand all of these over?

00:38:26.387 --> 00:38:29.098
I'd like everything
from last year up to today.

00:38:33.186 --> 00:38:34.479
Hello, this is Seong Yudeok.

00:38:35.772 --> 00:38:37.273
I had something to ask you.

00:38:41.903 --> 00:38:44.614
- It's in here.
- Okay.

00:39:02.298 --> 00:39:03.800
Put those in too.

00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:05.301
These were before the merger.

00:39:05.385 --> 00:39:07.428
- Just put them in.
- Give it to them.

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:11.224
What exactly are you investigating?

00:39:11.307 --> 00:39:14.477
We're checking if money
from the Dandelion Scholarship Foundation

00:39:14.561 --> 00:39:15.854
was paid as retainer fees here.

00:39:16.437 --> 00:39:20.024
If we find any signs of embezzlement
or violations of the Attorney Act,

00:39:20.108 --> 00:39:22.193
we'll have to file formal charges.

00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:26.990
The complaint says it's suspicious

00:39:27.073 --> 00:39:30.285
that the foundation
keeps sending money to this law firm

00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:31.870
as retainer fees.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:37.250
They're basically suspecting
that both are under your control.

00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:46.759
What is the meaning of this?

00:39:47.886 --> 00:39:52.181
We're dealing with a mess right now
just for accepting retainer fees from you.

00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:54.350
Who's Lee Dongsu?

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:56.853
- Lee Dongsu?
- Yes.

00:39:56.936 --> 00:39:58.646
Mr. Seong looked into it,

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:02.150
and apparently, it's all because
this Lee Dongsu filed the complaint.

00:40:03.735 --> 00:40:05.945
Is having your own office
at the firm making you…

00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:07.822
a little confused?

00:40:10.366 --> 00:40:13.494
Everyone, it's nothing.
So let's all calm down.

00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:16.080
- We didn't do anything wrong--
- What's your purpose?

00:40:17.624 --> 00:40:19.500
What was your purpose in merging?

00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:24.756
Did you really do the merger
so the foundation could funnel money away?

00:40:27.759 --> 00:40:29.886
At first, it seemed to be helpful.

00:40:29.969 --> 00:40:32.096
But then came
that conflict of interest case.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.474
And the associates
all hang out in their own clique.

00:40:35.058 --> 00:40:37.685
The associates have been acting strange
since the merger.

00:40:43.316 --> 00:40:46.277
There won't be any issues
with today's investigation.

00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:50.490
The retainers were for real cases
the foundation asked the firm to handle.

00:40:50.573 --> 00:40:51.866
There's nothing to cause concern.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.993
But it seems…

00:40:55.828 --> 00:40:58.206
that's not the only thing
you have issues with, is it?

00:41:25.066 --> 00:41:28.236
How long have you been with us now?

00:41:29.779 --> 00:41:32.615
It's been about three and a half years.

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:34.617
It's been a while.

00:41:37.036 --> 00:41:38.287
I…

00:41:38.371 --> 00:41:41.249
- I've always wondered.
- Yes?

00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:46.170
Why did you leave the firm downstairs
and come work for us?

00:41:46.254 --> 00:41:48.381
Well, you offered me a better salary.

00:41:50.425 --> 00:41:52.552
- Was that really the only reason?
- Yes.

00:41:54.012 --> 00:41:55.763
You sure are a strange one.

00:41:55.847 --> 00:42:00.977
I mean, if you move just one floor up,
you have to see Mr. Seong all the time.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.061
Isn't it really awkward?

00:42:02.145 --> 00:42:06.232
Then, why did you hire someone
who was right downstairs?

00:42:06.315 --> 00:42:07.734
It'd be awkward for you too.

00:42:07.817 --> 00:42:09.736
I liked you, Attorney Ha.

00:42:13.865 --> 00:42:16.826
I could tell right away
you wouldn't be someone who'd mess around.

00:42:19.162 --> 00:42:21.706
And when we spoke,
I figured we'd get along.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:30.631
When did you…

00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:33.384
start to think that way?

00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:35.678
At the interview.

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.266
We've never talked much besides then.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.062
- At the interview?
- Yes.

00:42:45.146 --> 00:42:47.148
At the interview. What were you thinking?

00:42:47.899 --> 00:42:50.193
I wasn't thinking about anything.

00:42:50.276 --> 00:42:51.861
What were you thinking about?

00:42:51.944 --> 00:42:53.821
I wasn't thinking about anything either.

00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:55.865
- What would I be thinking?
- Weird.

00:42:55.948 --> 00:42:58.117
Of course, it was the interview.

00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:06.167
Actually…

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.879
I offered to support you with your PhD

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:13.424
to keep you around longer.

00:43:15.468 --> 00:43:17.678
Really? I honestly had no idea.

00:43:18.346 --> 00:43:22.892
But my offer ended up
making you leave.

00:43:24.227 --> 00:43:25.228
What a shame.

00:43:34.487 --> 00:43:35.530
Ms. Kim.

00:43:36.989 --> 00:43:38.741
Thank you for everything.

00:43:38.825 --> 00:43:40.493
I learned a lot

00:43:41.244 --> 00:43:42.370
working under you.

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:43.996
Geez, stop it.

00:43:44.747 --> 00:43:47.500
Just drink. As if you learned from me.

00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:50.711
But are we supposed to
finish the whole thing like this?

00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:53.506
- Just drink however you want.
- It's so strong though.

00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:56.551
- This is how I drink.
- Wait.

00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:59.971
Take your time.

00:44:15.778 --> 00:44:17.029
You look pretty tired.

00:44:17.738 --> 00:44:19.115
Are there a lot of trials tomorrow?

00:44:19.907 --> 00:44:21.284
I don't have any tomorrow.

00:44:26.122 --> 00:44:27.373
I…

00:44:27.456 --> 00:44:29.584
I've decided to try
and become a public defender.

00:44:33.212 --> 00:44:34.755
I know it's not going to be easy.

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:39.343
Like you said, dealing with
shameless people was so tough.

00:44:40.094 --> 00:44:41.637
I met someone like that.

00:44:43.181 --> 00:44:44.182
But…

00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:47.685
I still saw it through to the end today.

00:44:49.187 --> 00:44:50.980
So don't worry too much about me.

00:44:59.572 --> 00:45:01.407
I know. You'll do great.

00:45:04.619 --> 00:45:06.078
It's a really tough job,

00:45:06.662 --> 00:45:10.166
but out of everyone I know,
you'd be the best person for it.

00:45:12.793 --> 00:45:13.794
Thanks.

00:46:09.892 --> 00:46:11.644
- Ms. Kim?
- No.

00:46:17.233 --> 00:46:18.818
Ms. Kim, did you sleep well?

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:22.154
Yes, I was out cold.

00:46:22.238 --> 00:46:23.698
Yeah, I slept like a rock.

00:46:31.289 --> 00:46:34.750
Yes, tell me what's going on.

00:46:35.793 --> 00:46:39.297
I've found something I want to pursue,
so I think I'll have to resign.

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.757
I'd like to apply
to become a public defender.

00:46:42.967 --> 00:46:44.510
I came here to tell you this.

00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:47.847
Thank you for all the opportunities
you've given me.

00:46:51.851 --> 00:46:53.311
I expected this.

00:46:54.061 --> 00:46:56.230
I didn't know
it'd be as a public defender,

00:46:56.314 --> 00:46:59.066
but I figured you'd want to go
in that direction.

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:02.820
I'm sorry I wasn't able to
fully support you in that.

00:47:04.447 --> 00:47:07.533
No, you've done more than enough for me.

00:47:10.244 --> 00:47:12.830
So how long do you plan to stay?

00:47:14.123 --> 00:47:16.417
If you need,
I'll stay until you find someone new.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.169
I'll stay as long as I can.

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.672
Didn't you say you hate staying

00:47:21.756 --> 00:47:24.383
and getting paid for work
you weren't fully invested in?

00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:28.804
- Sorry?
- During your interview,

00:47:28.888 --> 00:47:32.767
I asked why you quit your last job
before finding a new one,

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:35.227
and that's what you said then.

00:47:35.311 --> 00:47:38.314
I really liked that answer.

00:47:40.316 --> 00:47:44.111
I'll do my best right up to the end,
so my paycheck won't feel like a waste.

00:47:45.154 --> 00:47:47.865
Your answer then
was the reason why I hired you.

00:47:47.948 --> 00:47:49.992
I can't ask you to go back on your word.

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:55.206
You'll have a lot to study
for the public defender exam.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.793
Go study hard and make sure you pass.

00:47:59.377 --> 00:48:00.669
I'll handle things here.

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:07.802
It's a shame, but let's end it here.

00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:11.972
Okay.

00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:16.394
Thank you, ma'am.

00:48:19.021 --> 00:48:20.189
Me too.

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:23.234
I've finished the brief
for the Taegeon Pipeline case.

00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:25.569
I organized the current status
and handover notes

00:48:25.653 --> 00:48:28.322
for all 48 cases I was handling

00:48:28.406 --> 00:48:31.033
and saved them on my computer's desktop.

00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:35.913
When you hire a new attorney,
just have them check that file.

00:48:36.497 --> 00:48:38.457
Do you know any lawyers
you could recommend?

00:48:38.541 --> 00:48:40.042
It's been tough to find someone.

00:48:45.631 --> 00:48:48.342
If not, don't worry. I'll handle it.

00:48:48.426 --> 00:48:49.510
Thank you for your work.

00:48:52.638 --> 00:48:54.473
If we meet in court later, let's say hi.

00:48:55.474 --> 00:48:57.601
Yes, sir. Thank you.

00:49:18.038 --> 00:49:19.039
- Yes?
- Yes?

00:49:19.123 --> 00:49:20.749
- What?
- What is it?

00:49:20.833 --> 00:49:22.001
- Sorry.
- Right.

00:49:23.669 --> 00:49:25.713
- I need to drop by the fourth floor.
- Okay, sure.

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:28.966
- Okay.
- Today's your last day anyway.

00:49:29.049 --> 00:49:30.759
Why suddenly ask for permission?

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:33.596
- You can go.
- Yes, if you go this way…

00:49:33.679 --> 00:49:35.890
- Yes, I will.
- I'll go this way.

00:49:38.934 --> 00:49:41.729
Yunsu will believe
he got the scholarship from our foundation

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:44.690
{\an8}after being referred to by the orphanage.

00:49:46.192 --> 00:49:47.443
Yes, thank you.

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:51.489
Helping someone hold onto their dream…

00:49:51.572 --> 00:49:53.365
It really is a great feeling, isn't it?

00:49:54.241 --> 00:49:55.242
Yes.

00:49:56.452 --> 00:49:58.204
That's why I want to hold onto mine too.

00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:03.375
Rather than wanting to become a lawyer,

00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:06.295
I think I just wanted to keep studying.

00:50:06.378 --> 00:50:10.216
Back then, my circumstances
didn't make it easy to study.

00:50:10.966 --> 00:50:14.720
Also, being a lawyer seemed like
a good way to make a living.

00:50:16.222 --> 00:50:19.391
I never thought there would be
room in my life for a dream.

00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:21.769
But I have one now.

00:50:23.812 --> 00:50:25.523
I've decided…

00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:28.776
to pursue the PhD program.

00:50:29.818 --> 00:50:31.278
Really?

00:50:31.362 --> 00:50:33.656
That's great. Congratulations.

00:50:33.739 --> 00:50:35.991
I really wanted to tell you in person.

00:50:36.909 --> 00:50:38.827
Thank you for sharing that with me.

00:50:38.911 --> 00:50:41.580
Gosh, you'll be even busier now.

00:50:41.664 --> 00:50:44.083
Studying and working late nights…

00:50:45.084 --> 00:50:48.045
Actually, I'm going to resign.

00:50:49.296 --> 00:50:53.217
Now that I've figured out what I want,
I'm going to focus on just that.

00:50:55.177 --> 00:50:57.012
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

00:50:57.096 --> 00:50:58.764
Today's my last day.

00:50:58.847 --> 00:51:00.849
Today's my last day too.

00:51:03.519 --> 00:51:04.520
What do you mean?

00:51:04.603 --> 00:51:07.940
I'm stepping down from my position
as an advisor here.

00:51:08.566 --> 00:51:10.401
I guess being in Seocho-dong

00:51:10.484 --> 00:51:13.571
tricked me into thinking
that I'd achieved some kind of dream.

00:51:15.322 --> 00:51:18.284
So I kept hanging around here,

00:51:18.367 --> 00:51:20.160
bought a building,

00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:23.080
and wanted to rent it out to only lawyers.

00:51:24.415 --> 00:51:25.416
But…

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:28.335
I've come to accept
that none of those things

00:51:28.961 --> 00:51:30.713
could fill that void.

00:51:36.719 --> 00:51:37.720
I'm thinking…

00:51:39.597 --> 00:51:41.223
of studying again to become a lawyer.

00:51:47.146 --> 00:51:48.564
You can do it!

00:51:51.233 --> 00:51:52.943
You can do it too!

00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.491
I'll help you.

00:51:59.575 --> 00:52:00.826
Of course.

00:52:16.258 --> 00:52:19.595
I apologize again
for causing concern yesterday.

00:52:20.262 --> 00:52:24.141
We figured there won't be much trouble,
so it's all right.

00:52:25.434 --> 00:52:28.687
If there is an issue,
it'd be a headache for you, not us.

00:52:30.648 --> 00:52:33.817
Anyways, I'm more worried
about hiring a new associate.

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:36.445
Yours left too?

00:52:36.528 --> 00:52:38.989
We need to hire someone new too.

00:52:39.073 --> 00:52:40.366
Yeah, me too.

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:45.871
I'm not sure we'll find someone
as good as Attorney Kang.

00:52:45.954 --> 00:52:47.331
They all resigned?

00:52:47.414 --> 00:52:48.957
They'd always hang out together.

00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:50.709
Now, they're leaving together too. Geez.

00:52:50.793 --> 00:52:52.628
Wait, Attorney Ha quit too?

00:52:52.711 --> 00:52:56.048
Did he get a better offer
somewhere else again?

00:52:56.674 --> 00:52:58.509
No. That's not it.

00:52:58.592 --> 00:53:01.095
He left to study.
And I encouraged him to do it.

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.097
I see.

00:53:03.972 --> 00:53:06.016
Did anyone resign at your firm?

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.726
I heard someone was pregnant.

00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:10.479
Why would she quit?
She can just take maternity leave.

00:53:10.562 --> 00:53:12.398
We've found someone to cover for her.

00:53:12.481 --> 00:53:13.857
Why is your associate leaving?

00:53:15.609 --> 00:53:17.444
She found something she wants to do.

00:53:18.779 --> 00:53:22.866
Of course, I know associates
eventually move on,

00:53:23.701 --> 00:53:25.828
but it's always bittersweet for us.

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:30.332
The associates must be pretty sad
to part ways with each other too.

00:53:31.166 --> 00:53:34.128
It was always nice
seeing them get along so well.

00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:35.504
They helped me out a lot too.

00:53:43.345 --> 00:53:46.306
I wanted to see you in person
to say goodbye as well.

00:53:52.813 --> 00:53:56.608
Thanks to you, I was able to
live out a dream for a little while.

00:53:57.901 --> 00:54:01.488
Without this experience, I wouldn't have
had the courage to make this decision.

00:54:03.157 --> 00:54:07.661
You can keep the firm merged as is
or go back to how things were before.

00:54:08.203 --> 00:54:11.373
Whatever you choose,
I'll provide whatever support you need.

00:54:18.213 --> 00:54:19.631
Are you going somewhere?

00:54:21.133 --> 00:54:22.426
No.

00:54:22.509 --> 00:54:24.470
I just have something I want to focus on.

00:54:25.888 --> 00:54:30.392
I hope we get to
cross paths again someday.

00:54:39.485 --> 00:54:40.611
Please eat.

00:54:52.664 --> 00:54:53.790
Thank you.

00:54:56.376 --> 00:54:57.503
I'll get going.

00:55:49.638 --> 00:55:52.349
You don't need to come out.
We can go on our own.

00:55:55.394 --> 00:55:56.812
You're all free now.

00:55:56.895 --> 00:56:00.524
Gosh, trying to study again
at this age is rough.

00:56:01.066 --> 00:56:02.734
Then, don't go. Stay in Seocho-dong.

00:56:03.694 --> 00:56:04.695
I'll visit often.

00:56:04.778 --> 00:56:07.781
No one ever does after saying that.

00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:09.658
I can't help but come by often.

00:56:11.243 --> 00:56:12.578
How annoying.

00:56:12.661 --> 00:56:14.955
You don't have to tell me
when you're coming.

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:16.623
I don't want to know.

00:56:17.332 --> 00:56:18.584
All right.

00:56:19.084 --> 00:56:20.085
I'm off.

00:56:20.168 --> 00:56:22.379
- Bye. Keep in touch.
- I'll get going.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.360
It's due to the hormones, okay?

00:57:07.883 --> 00:57:12.220
Attorney Ahn, Deus GA is asking
if you can handle the appeal too.

00:57:12.888 --> 00:57:14.431
It seems Shin Jihye filed it.

00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:16.892
They said since you did
a great job last time,

00:57:16.975 --> 00:57:18.268
they want you on it again.

00:57:18.352 --> 00:57:19.436
I'd appreciate it.

00:57:40.165 --> 00:57:41.166
Yeah?

00:57:44.795 --> 00:57:46.922
I won't be taking the Deus GA case.

00:57:50.258 --> 00:57:51.259
What do you mean?

00:57:51.343 --> 00:57:54.096
Also, I'll be continuing
with Park Mansu's case.

00:57:54.179 --> 00:57:55.555
What?

00:57:56.765 --> 00:57:59.768
What are you doing?
I told you not to do that case anymore.

00:58:02.187 --> 00:58:03.188
Yes.

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.440
But I'm not saying I'll do it here.

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.071
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

00:58:15.075 --> 00:58:17.536
Thank you for everything.

00:58:17.619 --> 00:58:19.162
You're quitting?

00:58:19.705 --> 00:58:20.706
Yes.

00:58:28.213 --> 00:58:30.674
I know you've been unhappy with me lately.

00:58:30.757 --> 00:58:32.300
But as the managing partner,

00:58:33.385 --> 00:58:35.721
I have responsibilities.

00:58:35.804 --> 00:58:37.389
Attorney Ahn, you understand that.

00:58:37.973 --> 00:58:40.016
I don't think your approach is wrong.

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:43.687
I became used to it,
so I worked with you for 10 years.

00:58:44.521 --> 00:58:47.774
But now, that familiarity
has started to feel uncomfortable.

00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:51.903
I'd like to try it my own way now.

00:58:58.452 --> 00:59:00.829
- Does that mean you plan to go solo?
- Yes.

00:59:08.754 --> 00:59:12.007
No matter what I say
to try to convince you…

00:59:13.425 --> 00:59:14.760
you won't change your mind, right?

00:59:16.887 --> 00:59:18.263
No, I don't think so.

00:59:18.346 --> 00:59:19.347
Okay.

00:59:20.474 --> 00:59:21.558
I understand.

00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.604
Thank you for your work.

00:59:31.193 --> 00:59:32.277
Thank you, sir.

00:59:52.047 --> 00:59:53.715
Why did you want to see me?

00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:56.593
- There's something I had to tell you.
- What?

00:59:57.469 --> 00:59:59.971
Did that company tell you
to pass along another message?

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:03.517
- It's not like that--
- Then, let me ask you first.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.394
Were you on Deus' side from the beginning?

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:10.023
Did you pretend to listen
while hiding that from me?

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.568
You know…

01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:18.532
I told you everything,
because I trusted you.

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:21.618
How could you do that?

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:25.831
I'm sorry.

01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:27.707
That's not what it was.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.125
Then, what was it?

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.169
What did you come here to say?

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:34.631
I heard you're filing the appeal.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:41.012
- You're trying to stop me from that too?
- No.

01:00:45.267 --> 01:00:48.770
All insurance contracts are made
to be logged in the company's system.

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:54.234
If what you said is true
and they keep people late to hit quotas,

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:57.237
there should be a lot
of late-night entries in the system.

01:00:57.988 --> 01:01:02.659
Some of those were probably contracts
the agents input themselves.

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:06.121
If you submit those records,
they will help prove the abuse.

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:14.421
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:20.677
Because I wanted to make things right.

01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:34.900
I'm truly sorry.

01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:52.751

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:28.823
Hold on!

01:04:30.658 --> 01:04:32.243
Thank you.

01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:15.120
Ms. Jang.

01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:19.124
Attorney Bae!

01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:22.418
- It's been a long time.
- Congratulations on the baby!

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:23.962
- Thank you.
- Welcome back.

01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:25.046
Attorney Bae.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:27.549
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:30.009
It's been so long
since I've been out of the house.

01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:32.762
Hey, there.

01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:34.430
- Mr. Na.
- How's the baby doing?

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:36.057
How have you been?

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:37.934
Good. You can work and go.

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:42.438
The baby's… doing well.

01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.277
He hasn't changed a bit.

01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:50.196
Come in.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:54.659
My goodness. Hello, Attorney Bae.

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:56.828
It's been a while. How have you been?

01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:59.831
Good. Hold on, you look great though.

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:02.292
No way. I feel like I'm dying.

01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:08.173
Hang in there for the one-year miracle.
Things get better after the first year.

01:06:08.256 --> 01:06:10.592
- That miracle will really happen?
- Yeah.

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:15.930
In any case, I'm sorry to bother you
while you're on leave.

01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:17.390
No, it's okay.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:19.934
I live right next door anyway.

01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:22.437
I heard the Sumyeong ENC case
is giving you trouble?

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:26.399
Yes, it's a case you wrote
the complaint for before you left.

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:28.818
But it's progressing differently
from what I expected.

01:06:28.902 --> 01:06:30.820
{\an8}- Can I see the file?
- Yes.

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:34.782
- It's this part.
- I see. This part.

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:40.079
This isn't it.

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:46.377
Where was it?

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:47.754
- This?
- Yeah!

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:48.922
Okay.

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:53.176
What time was tonight's
evening class moved to?

01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:56.221
I'm not the teaching assistant
for that one.

01:06:56.804 --> 01:06:58.431
- You're not?
- No, Professor.

01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:01.726
- Gosh…
- That. This one.

01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:02.977
Yeah, that's it.

01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:10.735
Then, can you post a notice later
saying I'll be five minutes late

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:12.779
for the law school class on contract law?

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.113
Yes, Professor.

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:15.740
Hold on!

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.536
- Kang Sumin?
- Here.

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.498
- Kang Hyeokchan.
- Here.

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:25.500
- Ko Eunho.
- Here!

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:27.335
- Donghyo.
- Here.

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:29.629
- Minju.
- Here.

01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:31.756
- Seonhyeong.
- Here.

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:33.716
- Kim Sein.
- Here.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:37.679
- Kim Hyungmin.
- Here.

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:42.558
- Na Junyeong.
- Here.

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:44.560
- Noh Yunseong.
- Here.

01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:46.354
- Nam Sehun.
- Here.

01:07:46.938 --> 01:07:47.939
Mun Boram.

01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:53.653
My goodness.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.617
I told you to wait there.

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:02.912
Why? It's nice to walk there together.

01:08:06.624 --> 01:08:08.918
It's tough coming here
every day for lunch, isn't it?

01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:11.379
My boyfriend is a student.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:13.423
I have to at least keep him fed.

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:16.592
Come along.

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.678
I feel like you'll buy me
something fancy today.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:21.639
No, I'm not.
We're going to eat tteokbokki.

COUNSEL'S SEAT

01:08:57.425 --> 01:09:00.261
Prosecutor, state your sentencing request.

01:09:04.432 --> 01:09:06.517
The defendant embezzled
billions of company funds,

01:09:06.601 --> 01:09:08.019
denied it to the end,

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:12.982
and even coerced his subordinates
into perjury to put the blame on them.

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:15.443
There's been no sign of remorse.

01:09:15.526 --> 01:09:19.113
Since this is the behavior
of a shameless and vicious criminal,

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:23.076
we request a sentence of 15 years
in prison as strict punishment.

01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:30.208
{\an8}PROSECUTOR'S SEAT

01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:40.968
Hello.

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:47.266
Here.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:51.187
Attorney Kang,
how many are you seeing today?

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:53.856
Today, I'll be seeing 17 of them.

01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.024
Gosh.

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:58.403
Please wait out here for a moment
and have some water.

01:09:58.486 --> 01:09:59.529
Okay.

01:10:23.845 --> 01:10:26.514
Everyone, don't worry too much.
It'll all work out.

01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:28.599
Sir, everything will work out.

01:10:30.143 --> 01:10:31.227
Attorney Ahn.

01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:36.607
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:44.907
Let's go.

01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:48.035
Civil case number 2026-3784.

01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:52.081
Plaintiff Han Sucheol and 42 others.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:55.293
Defendant Kwak Jeongyeon
and nine others.

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:56.586
Is everyone ready?

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:57.754
Yes, Your Honor.

01:10:57.837 --> 01:11:00.339
Okay. Attorneys from both sides,
please step forward.

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:05.970
Plaintiffs and defendants,
please remain in the gallery.

01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:12.059
We're starting a difficult case.

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:15.062
Who's representing the plaintiffs?

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:18.566
I'm Ahn Juhyeong,

01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:21.319
attorney for Han Sucheol and 42 others.

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:44.383
PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:49.764
Let's go eat.

01:11:51.098 --> 01:11:52.600
Were today's visits rough too?

01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:56.312
I ran into a total madman this time.
He was a complete lunatic.

01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:57.855
I couldn't believe that guy.

01:11:57.939 --> 01:11:59.899
- You ran into a madman?
- Yeah.

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:01.067
You should back out.

01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:03.152
I have to do it. It's my job.

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:04.695
I'm a public servant.

01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:06.781
Or you could come work with me.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.368
- Nope.
- But why? "Nope"?

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:17.959
Everything's changed except for this.

01:12:18.042 --> 01:12:19.377
This will never change.

01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:25.007
Hello.

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:31.597
- You still dragging your feet?
- Come on, I'm not that late.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:34.100
Want to hear something funny
that happened today?

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.518
Tell me later.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:37.311
- You only poured for yourself.
- Hello.

01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:38.521
Geez, seriously?

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:40.731
You just never change…

01:12:40.815 --> 01:12:42.358
Look at the time!

01:12:43.985 --> 01:12:44.986
Haven't ordered yet?

01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:46.737
Not everyone's here.

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:48.531
How's the baby doing?

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.495
Here they are.

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:58.040
Do you have no concept of time
or no concept of etiquette?

01:12:58.124 --> 01:12:59.959
Checking everyone's attendance
took 30 minutes.

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:03.296
- I had 17 client visits.
- Hey, I came all the way from Suwon.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:05.548
I came back out after watching my kid.

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:07.425
- Hurry up and order.
- Okay.

01:13:07.508 --> 01:13:10.177
- Five bean sprout soups, please.
- Okay.

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:25.526
Next time, let's meet in the middle.

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:27.069
That's what I wanted to say.

01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:30.781
But we've never met
anywhere else for lunch, have we?

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:33.868
Nope. We've never gone
outside this area.

01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:36.746
Just come to Seocho-dong.
It's comfortable here.

01:13:45.671 --> 01:13:48.007
Next time, let's eat something nice.

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:49.926
- Yeah.
- Who even suggested

01:13:50.009 --> 01:13:51.552
- bean sprout soup today?
- Exactly.

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:53.304
- We should've gotten pork cutlets.
- Sanggi.

01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:54.972
- What?
- Let's get some bossam.

01:13:57.516 --> 01:13:58.643
They have bossam here?

01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:02.063
- Thanks for buying, Sanggi.
- They have octopus bossam.

01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:43.646
{\an8}Law and The City

01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:26.147
Law and The City

01:15:30.109 --> 01:15:31.152
{\an8}Is the kimchi good?

01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:32.903
{\an8}Yeah, try it.

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:15.529
