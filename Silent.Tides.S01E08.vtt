00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.740
We know

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.310
the Japanese blockade is tight.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.120
But the Portuguese Macau government

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.010
might sign an agreement
with the Japanese at any moment.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.200
Once the Japanese fully takes over Macau,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.460
the important people Mr. Ke is protecting,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.460
and the remaining
wartime supplies I'm holding,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.060
will never make it out.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.980
So we must move them now,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.270
while we still can.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.829
It's a huge task,

to help.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.940
If it's just leaving Macau,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.090
that's easy enough.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.250
At night,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.620
using small boats,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.520
we can still slip through

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.850

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.600
But Zhongshan

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.910
has been under Huang Gongjie's control
for a long time.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.579
Once we enter Zhongshan,

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.020
I cannot guarantee

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.520
your safety.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.790
Mr. Ke

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.350
has his own plan about this.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.740
As long as you get the people and supplies

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.680

their safety in Zhongshan

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.730
will be guaranteed by Commander Qu

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.660
and Commander Qu

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.829

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:55.820
Commander Qu?

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.450
You mean

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.190
-the captain
of the Communist Party guerrilla team?
-Yes.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.700
Commander Qu's reputation precedes him.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.160
With his guarantee,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.510
the Tai Ho Brotherhood has no objections.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.960
However...

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.530
However what?

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.520
It's not that I, Huang Sanhe,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.360
am petty or distrustful.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.920
But this job

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.050
could cost us our heads.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.140
If we enter Zhongshan

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.690
and Commander Qu
doesn't meet us as promised,

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.020
the Tai Ho Brotherhood
will be walking into a death trap.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.190

how can you be sure

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.710
you've really secured
the help of Commander Qu?

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.280
Can I vouch for it?

But Commander Qu...

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.730

was Commander Qu himself.

Mr. Ke,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.800
I was referred to you
by a friend from Mr. Zhou's residence

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.500
at Zengjiayan in Chongqing—

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.850
I am the British Consul to Macau, Reeves.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.390
The situation is roughly as follows:

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.390
After receiving the consulate's report,

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.920
the British government tried every means
to contact the Communists,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.700
and eventually

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.450

through the Chongqing office

of the Eighth Route Army.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.190
Although the Communists
did not acknowledge

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.430
the existence of a Communist underground
organization in Macau,

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.090
they did not object to my coming to
the Kiang Wu Hospital

to seek medical treatment
and purchase medicine from you, Mr. Ke.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.740
I believe the underlying meaning
of this response

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.450
is that they have agreed for me

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.670
to seek your assistance, haven't they?

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:29.650
Yes.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.390
You understand better than anyone

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.340
how difficult things
are in Macau right now.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:34.940
As it happens,

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.880
many businesspeople from Hong Kong
have fled to Macau.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.860
The General Chamber of Commerce
is organizing this gathering

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.830
to unite the business communities
of Hong Kong and Macau,

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:43.630
pool our efforts,

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.960
and overcome these tough times together.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.810
Mr. He,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.610
with your abilities, you should attend.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.420
In my current state,

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.370
what good would my presence do?

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.510
Going would still be a way
to show your support for Macau.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.470
Besides,

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.210
Besides, Wanqi is one of
the organizers of this gathering—

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.740
seeing you there would
surely make him happy.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.320
[Nanhua Medical Club]

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:11.440
Brother, be careful.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.520
Walk slowly.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.090
Okay.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.760
Miss Qiao,

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.770
have you heard any news
about your brother yet?

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:39.150
I don't have the means

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.010
to get news from Hong Kong either.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.300
The only thing I can do now is

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.540
to buy a copy
of The Hong Kong Island Daily every day

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.600
to see if there's any news about
captured individuals.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.660
Your brother was a manager at HSBC

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.610
and a well-known public figure.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.490
If anything major happened,

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.660
it would definitely be
reported in the papers.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.690
On the flip side,

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.990
the lack of news

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.310
might actually be proof
that the situation is stable.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.520
Are you cold?

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.180
He just got discharged—

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:13.910
don't stay out too long.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.300
You should head back soon.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.110
Go.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:18.440
If I

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.880
hear any news about Yu and her daughter,

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.440
I'll come find you at the Flower-Stern Ferry
as soon as possible.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.310
Thank you for your trouble, Miss Qiao.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.260
Not at all.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.280
They saved my life too.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.920
If

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.570
you hear any news about them first,

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.970
please send word to me
at Bachongtian Club.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.440
Bachongtian Club?

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.300
I applied for a job at Bachongtian Club.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.630
They needed a musician.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.900
In these times,
we all have to find a way to survive,

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.660
don't we?

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.240
It's good to rely on your own skills

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:51.490
to make a living

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.410
and stand on your own feet.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.800
Thankfully, we didn't
let you pawn off this suit—

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.280
otherwise, you wouldn't have
anything decent

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.010
to wear for today's gathering.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.460
What's wrong?

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.330
Are you still worried about

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.380
meeting your old colleagues

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.240
from the Finance Street tonight?

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.160
Isn't Mr. Ma also going?

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.300
As long as he explains things to everyone,

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.300
those misunderstandings
should clear up naturally.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.140
Dr. Ke mentioned

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.140
that batch of goods
hasn't been fully dealt with yet—

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.070
Mr. Ma might not be
in a position to explain right now.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.040
Don't worry.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.970
I've made it through this long already,

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.770
and I can handle a few
more harsh words from others.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:44.680
With everyone from the Hong Kong
and Macau business circles

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.760
gathering together tonight,

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.110
it should at least make it easier

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.840
to look for job opportunities.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.710
We still have

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.560
a bit of the money

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.380
Dr. Ke lent us left.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.640
Tonight, I'll make a couple of dishes

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.640
and prepare a New Year's Eve dinner.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.380
We'll wait for you to come home

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.300
so our family can celebrate together.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:58.880
Okay.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.040
Daddy,

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.610
we'll wait for you to come back
and spend New Year's together.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.160
Yes.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.760
Hello.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.290
Hello. Please sign in here.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.830
The gathering will start in an hour.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.660
This is now free networking time,

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.970
a chance for friends
from various business circles

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.690
in Hong Kong and Macau
to get to know each other.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:16.300
Got it.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:28.520
Hey,

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.730
isn't this the big boss

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:32.900
He Xian?

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.380
Mr. Lyu, is he your friend?

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.060
Oh,

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.090
I wouldn't dare say so.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.800
Us small fries

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.350
aren't worthy of
being friends with Mr. He.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.470
A man like him can even

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.850
swindle the entire
Hong Kong Finance Street—

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.970
all his own peers—to profit
from the nation's suffering.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:51.850
That's a skill

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.970
I could never learn, even if I tried.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.520
Hey, he's the banker who exploited the war

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.140
with the Japanese
to cheat his own colleagues.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.700
Who else could it be?

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.600
We didn't realize it

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.380
until Macau reopened

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.910
and we saw him
buddying up with Huang Gongjie—

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.470
turns out he's been in bed
with the traitors all along.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.520
Huang Gongjie? You mean...

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.260
Yes,

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.190
that very traitor

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.400
who hoarded all the grain in Zhongshan.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.680
Macau's current plight

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.440
is entirely thanks to
that damned collaborator.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.590
Alright, everyone,

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.760
I think

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.490
the purpose of today'
Hong Kong-Macau gathering

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.760
is to overcome this crisis together

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.960
and solve the famine.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.380
But what I don't understand is:

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.190
why should an accomplice of the traitor

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.550
who created this famine

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.590
be allowed to mix in here?

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.720
What do you all think

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.310
we should do about it?

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.310
What should we do?

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:42.850
Get out!

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.190
Yes, make him get out!

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.020
Yes, get out!

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.540
Get out!

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.690
Get out!

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:49.580
Get out!

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.310
Get out!

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.340
Get out!

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.590
Get out!

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.380
Who was it?

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.210
Who's talking such foul nonsense
right here in public?

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.190
The voice is loud,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.540
and the words stink. Who was it?

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.040
Go on, keep talking,

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.070
keep hurling insults.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.200
Hey, Captain Huang,

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.450
don't misunderstand.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.110
We just ran into a few peers

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.660
and were chatting, that's all.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.490
Xian,

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.020
just point out who insulted you just now.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.640
I, Huang Gongjie, will stand up for you.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.090
Ah.

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:16.280
Hey, Captain Huang,

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:17.590
weren't you saying

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.090
you wanted to find a good buyer
for that batch of grain?

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.690
I was just discussing it with some peers,

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:22.880
and we've just made some progress.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.020
With such a big deal,

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.370
it's inevitable that some might
feel jealous and complain a little.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:27.900
Please don't take it too seriously.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.990
So there's progress

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.950
on that business deal?

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:30.570
Yes.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:33.610
Why don't we move to another place

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.640
where I can brief you in detail?

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:36.760
Fine.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.640
Let's go to my place.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.400
Let's go.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.350
Great!

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.440
Traitorous scum!

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.830
Everyone, remember this:

00:16:58.830 --> 00:16:59.880
we are medical orderlies
from Kiang Wu Hospital,

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.330
out to treat plague patients.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.050
Everyone must wear armbands and masks,

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.450
and remember the identity
and name on your papers.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.510
The vehicle will arrive in two hours.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.900
Have you all remembered what I said?

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.319
Yes.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.010
Yes.

Driver, take us to the pier.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:18.990
Hey, driver!

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.160
Driver, take us to the pier please.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:21.660
Not going.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.420
No time.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.250

Hey, Zhengping.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:41.370
I'm going back first.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.230
He'll look for you later.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.480
Stay put. Don't go anywhere.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:56.900
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:57.790
hello.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.420
I am pleased to announce

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.100
that the famed violinist,
Miss Qiao Yinwan,

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.290
has officially joined Bachongtian Club

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.190
as our lead musician.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:07.740
Let's give a warm round of applause

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.670
to welcome her first performance!

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.640
You!

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.210
Play The Warship March for me.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:32.840
Liven up

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.420
this banquet!

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.160
You, lead musician.

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:41.450
Captain Inoshita orders you

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:43.780
to play The Warship March.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.660
I don't know that song.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:54.920
What?

00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:59.170
Switch to

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.670
Song of the Etajima Boys then.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.470
Hurry and play!

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.680
Switch to

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.680
Song of the Etajima Boys then.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.030
Start playing!

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.900
I don't know any Japanese songs.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.540
Captain Inoshita!

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.160
Captain Inoshita.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.900
Captain Inoshita!

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.890
Captain Inoshita!

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:18.620
Don't be angry.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.480
Don't be angry.

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.610
Miss Qiao

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.180
doesn't have the sheet music

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:22.680
and she also

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.740
hasn't rehearsed.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.190
Indeed, she doesn't really know

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.620
these Japanese songs.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.750
Please understand.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:33.600
You don't know Japanese songs?

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.360
Then you must know Chinese songs, right?

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.600
If you don't know Japanese songs,

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.620
surely you know Chinese ones?

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.590
So play one of your Chinese songs.

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:45.990
Celebrating the Japanese Army's Return.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.940
Play this one.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.950
Celebrating the Japanese Army's Return.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:50.690
Alright.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.010
When Will the Gentleman Return?

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:54.170
No!

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.930
Celebrating the Japanese Army's Return.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:58.450
A song celebrating our Imperial Army

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:03.140
returning to occupy Shanghai.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.280
Not only must you play it,

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.710
everyone here must sing along!

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.900
Celebrating the Japanese Army!

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.920
Celebrating the Japanese Army?

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:13.650
Understood?

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.270
It's about the same.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:21.730
Miss Qiao.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:23.130
Given the situation,

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.130
perhaps you could compromise.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:31.900
Miss Qiao!

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:34.420
Hey, hey!

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.580
-Where are you going?
-Captain Inoshita!

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.340
Come back right now!

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.010
Miss Qiao isn't feeling well.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.610
I'll go check on her.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.360
Please rest first.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.340
Manager, arrange another program.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:43.750
Okay.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:45.480
I'll arrange another program!

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:52.050
Got it.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.880
Keep watching them.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:59.490
We found it.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:01.720
The corpse truck
did indeed leave from

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.410
Kiang Wu Hospital.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.100
However...

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.480
However what?

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.780
Usually mortuary staff
transport the bodies.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.530
A chief doctor transporting the body

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:14.590
is unprecedented.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:15.710
I heard that

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:19.050
Dr. Ke Lin volunteered to do it.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.710
Tell Yamaguchi and Fearless Biao

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:24.820
to meet at the cemetery.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:31.920
Why are you being like this?

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.530
It's just a song.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.640
You call that a song?

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:41.990
Miss Qiao.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.260
I know you're upset.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:47.880
I know the Japanese go too far.

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:49.920
But when you're living under
someone else's roof,

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.840
sometimes you have to bow your head.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.970
You know how vicious

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.250
the Japanese are.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.420
So sometimes,

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.680
we don't need to clash with them

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.540
over small matters and defy them.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.490
We'll only suffer for it.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:02.790
I'm sorry, Dr. Lok Pak.

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.220
I can't be as diplomatic as you.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:07.030
And I certainly will not

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.450
applaud or sing praises

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:10.140
to a bunch of bandits

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.450
who invade our land and kill our people.

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:14.710
If a job demands I flatter the devil,

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:16.190
then I'm sorry,

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:17.270
I quit right now.

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:17.490
[East Asia Hotel]

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:18.210
Yinwan!

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:23.120
But please don't forget, Dr. Lok Pak.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.520
Beneath your Portuguese citizenship,

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.220
you also have Chinese blood
flowing in your veins.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:39.160
Hello?

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.420
Your Excellency the Governor.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.620
Has it been verified?

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.140
It has been verified.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:50.680
Good.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:53.440
I'll notify everyone immediately

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.640
to meet at your place.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:13.380
Don't push me.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.250
My mother is starving!

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:16.230
Don't push me!

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.230
She won't last-

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.290
Give me some space!

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.640
She has almost nothing to eat,

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.230
she's starving to death!

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:27.190
Give me some!

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.250
She's dying!

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:29.840
Save my mother!

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.800
She's starving to death!

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.710
Yu?

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:36.580
Ms. Qiao!

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.470
Yu!

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:38.660
Where did you go?

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.820
Everyone's looking for you.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:41.400
My mother is starving to death!

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.660
Please save my mother!

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.010
It's you!

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:00.080
Go play the violin!

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:00.730
Get lost!

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:01.730
Damn it!

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.270
Stop right there, you bastard!

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.040
Stop!

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.380
Yu, let's go.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.230
Take me to your mom.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.199
What are you doing?

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:14.070
Go back and play your violin.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:14.860
Let me go!

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.090
Yu, go find your mom first.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.320
Are you looking down on me?

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.239
Go, Yu!

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.440
Don't worry about me.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:23.320
You're an

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:24.900
anti-Japanese!

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.150
Very bad person!

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.810
Captain! Captain!

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:39.199
Bastard!

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:42.330
Stop!

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:43.380
What are you doing?

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.719
What? Let go!

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.969
If you don't let go,

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:46.850
I'll shoot.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.710
What are you guys doing?

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:52.620
Colonel Sawa.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:53.510
Look at this.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:56.350
This is Portuguese-ruled Macau.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:57.800
Is the Japanese Navy

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.280
going to openly attack me,

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.610
the Economic Director?

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:02.170
Put your gun down.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:03.020
Yes, sir.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:07.170
What is going on?

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:11.110
These two Chinese people dared to attack

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:12.170
Captain Inoshita.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.220
They must be severely punished.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.840
Captain Inoshita.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.380
Captain Inoshita!

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.800
Captain.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:23.670
Quick, call a doctor.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.780
Hurry!

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:47.320
Let's sing!

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.110
Colonel Sawa.

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:53.070
Let's drink.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.320
Let's drink together.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.940
Help the Captain back to rest.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.990
Have another drink!

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:02.690
Let me go!

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:15.820
Did you see these two people

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:18.310
hit Captain Inoshita?

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:20.610
Captain Inoshita

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:23.360
was chasing after this woman
from the band.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:24.740
When I came downstairs,

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.320
Captain Inoshita was lying on the ground

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.900
and these two were standing here.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.700
If not them, then who?

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:33.940
Miss Qiao

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.910
is just a defenseless woman.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.070
How could she possibly hit anyone,

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:42.050
let alone injure a Japanese Navy captain?

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:43.660
Colonel Sawa.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.470
You saw how drunk Captain Inoshita was,

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.740
didn't you?

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.820
He accidentally fell and hurt himself.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.300
How can you blame others?

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.280
Chief.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:56.970
I specially invited Mr. He

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:59.400
to the Special Operations Team
to discuss business.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.530
He's also my friend.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:01.630
I don't think he would

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:03.630
hit someone from the Imperial Army.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.110
Did Captain Inoshita

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.630
fall on his own?

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.700
I'm sorry,

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:29.510
we didn't see.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.150
I suppose so.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.110
Nonsense!

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:46.550
Colonel Sawa.

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:48.570
I specially invited Miss Qiao

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.570
to be the lead musician.

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:53.320
If you want to pursue this matter further,

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:54.840
then come after me.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.280
Captain Inoshita

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.720
accidentally fell while drunk.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:12.630
It was purely an accident.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:14.860
You two

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.650
may leave now.

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:19.650
Mr. He,

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:21.860
we have other matters to attend to today.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.790
We'll discuss our business later.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:28.830
Let's go.

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.110
Mr. Lok Pak.

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:41.340
You're heading to the Government House
for a meeting?

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:43.050
Don’t let me hold you up.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:45.300
Remember.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.490
The Imperial Army is waiting for you

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:51.650
to make a wise decision.

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:55.170
Goodbye.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:06.760
[Hong Kong–Macau Business Community
New Year’s Eve Gathering]

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.630
Everyone.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.340
Dear colleagues from
the Hong Kong-Macau Chamber of Commerce,

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.170
we sincerely apologize.

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:12.130
Chairman Gao of
the General Chamber of Commerce

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:14.950
and everyone on duty
have received an urgent notice

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:17.590
and have just left for
an important meeting at Government House.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:19.050
Therefore, today's

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:20.800
gathering has to be postponed.

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.510
Please wait patiently for further notice.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:24.110
Thank you.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.340
Miss Qiao.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.430
Did Yu mention where her mother was?

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:36.580
I was in such a hurry earlier

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.340
that I didn't get a chance to ask.

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.540
What should we do now?

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.250
Where should we look for them?

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.340
Excuse me, may I ask

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:43.720
if you've seen a 13 or 14-year-old girl

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.880
crying and running with something?

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.800
Hello.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.720
Did you see a little girl,

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.650
about this tall?

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.670
Mommy, Mommy!

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.170
Mommy! Mommy!

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:18.840
Mommy!

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.450
Wake up, Mommy!

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.810
Mommy!

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.010
Mommy!

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:28.670
Wake up, Mommy!

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.220
Xiao Yu.
Xiao Yu.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:49.450
Yu?

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:50.880
Yu!

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:52.340
Yu!

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.840
Xiao Yu.
Xiao Yu.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.090
Xiao Yu.
Xiao Yu.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.090
Yu!

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:05.090
Yinwan.

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:06.580
Yu's shoe.

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:09.900
It's her shoe.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.570
Xiao Yu.
Xiao Yu.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.950
Yu!

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:13.990
Are you looking for

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:15.720
that Boat Dweller girl called Yu?

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.380
Yes.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.910
Have you seen her?

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.720
About this tall, wearing blue clothes,

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.800
with her mother?

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.800
No need to look anymore.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.760
They've been taken away.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.800
Taken away?

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:25.860
What do you mean?

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:28.720
The two of them have been
sleeping outside our door

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.010
for several days now.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:31.530
She just passed away

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.010
and the Tongshan Hall's corpse truck
took her away.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.920
Passed away?

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.440
Yes.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:37.360
How is that possible?

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.710
Why not?

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:41.590
When that girl arrived
and saw her mother was dead,

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:42.840
she couldn't catch her breath

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.220
and collapsed on the spot.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.220
The Tongshan Hall corpse truck
happened to pass by

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.260
and took them both away.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:50.340
Are you sure she's dead?

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.200
She was still able to run just now.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:54.590
Look at these streets.

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:56.050
Children like her

00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:58.180
are taken away by the dozens every day.

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.380
Who has the time to check carefully?

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:03.090
Even if she still had a breath left,

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:04.570
by the time they haul her to the cemetery,

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.380
she'll certainly dead.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:09.120
That's not true.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:10.900
She must still be alive.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.520
Yu must still be alive.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.650
Where did the corpse truck
take the bodies?

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.650
Taipa.

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:18.720
The new government cemetery.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.260
Let's go.

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:27.150
Report.

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:28.990
I asked the cemetery staff.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:31.790
The Kiang Wu Hospital corpse truck
never arrived.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.200
It should take only an hour
from the hospital.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.720
That truck hasn't arrived in two hours.

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.820
Seems like that truck
is really suspicious.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:40.720
Should we immediately
search for and arrest

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.180
that doctor called Ke Lin?

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:01.630
Are you Dr. Ke Lin?

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:03.950
I am. May I ask what this is about?
