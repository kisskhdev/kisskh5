00:01:37.644 --> 00:01:41.260
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.140
=Episode 3=

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.120
Yao,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.150
it's time to get up.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.540
Hello?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.280
It was just a hallucination.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.377
Hey, ghost.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.710
Ghost?

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.710
Is that you?

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.870
Hey!

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.870
Yes, it's me...

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.360
This must be a magic mirror.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.310
I thought yesterday
was just my imagination.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.590
What imagination?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.430
You were talking to me
from inside the mirror.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.000
I don't know why you're in there,

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.870
but thank you.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.590
If it weren't for you yesterday,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.710
I...

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.680
I wouldn't be here anymore.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.310
It was nothing.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.466
It's not worth mentioning.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.680
I never thought

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.310
I'd see you again.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.150
Look.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.560
My wounds have almost healed.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.150
That day,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.590
reinforcements did come.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.840
I guess

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.590
I owe it to you, Miss Ghost.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.430
Looks like

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.800
you're doing fine, too.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.710
Good.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.680
I'm glad.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.630
I'm not a ghost.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.630
I'm still alive.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.430
Don't ever call me that again.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.590
Then what should I call you?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.920
A woman?

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.000
That's even worse than a ghost.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.910
Are you really

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.150
from ancient times?

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.280
Ancient?

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.680
What ancient times?

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.470
I'm a Captain of Valiant Cavalry.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.470
Li Yansheng

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.870
is my name.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.590
Captain?

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.680
Are you

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.150
a general?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.630
A captain isn't a general.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.360
I'll be one soon enough.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.030
Wait.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.630
Are you not Han?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.800
I...

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.200
I'm Han,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.120
in a way.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.760
More precisely,

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.270
I'm Han Chinese.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.390
You wouldn't get it.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.920
Yao, breakfast is ready!

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.310
Coming!

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.830
If you really are from the past,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.066
the medical care in your era

00:04:33.088 --> 00:04:34.360
must be seriously underdeveloped.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.600
In my era?

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.310
You need to keep your wounds clean.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.390
Don't let them get infected.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.270
Eat more meat.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.190
I don't know

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.040
if you have eggs or milk in your time,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.600
but if you do, have more.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.040
It'll help you recover faster.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.630
And sleep more,

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.270
and drink plenty of water.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.430
I have to go.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.270
Goodbye.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.360
She really seems to care about me.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.720
Our army

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.630
will press forward in one decisive push

00:05:33.644 --> 00:05:35.460
and strike straight
at the enemy's stronghold!

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.510
We set out tomorrow.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.950
Didn't you just come off
the battlefield that night?

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.190
You're heading out again already?

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.030
You...

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.440
Never mind.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.840
Do you mean

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.040
the night

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.510
we met?

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.350
Yes.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.560
That was more than a month ago.

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:56.533
The wounds on my face
have healed completely.

00:05:56.533 --> 00:05:57.270
See?

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.630
A month ago?

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.720
It's only been three days for me.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.030
Woman,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.830
could you be a fairy?

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.190
One day in heaven,

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.160
and ten days on earth.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.830
Don't call me woman.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.950
That's strange.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.950
Just call me

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.270
He Yiyao.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.240
He Yiyao?

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.390
So your name's He Yiyao.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.870
You don't

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.750
look so well.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.430
Why do you stay indoors all the time?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.720
You should go out more,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.040
as I do.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.560
I'll show you.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.040
This is the scenery of our desert.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.480
What do you think?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.320
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.040
You ought to get out more.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.240
The world is vast.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.750
There are wonders everywhere.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.880
It...

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.630
It's not very convenient for me.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.190
Why not?

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.560
It's hard for me to go out.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.190
Even if you're a sheltered young lady

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.920
who can't leave her residence,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.680
you could at least go
into the courtyard

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.955
to get some air and sunlight.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.720
Staying inside all the time

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.800
will do you no good.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.480
How dull and lifeless is that?

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.000
(Dull and lifeless...)

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:39.670
(Yes.)

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.240
(That's me.)

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.160
I can't go out.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.190
Do you think I want this life?

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.830
Then why?

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.360
I'm not like you.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.270
I don't have a healthy body

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.270
that can go wherever it wants.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.560
I'm crippled.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.360
I can only sit in this wheelchair

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:20.870
and be pushed around.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.120
Even getting out
the door is a challenge.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.070
That's why

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.070
you wanted

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.600
to end it all.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.630
Dr. Zhao said

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.870
there was a chance I could
stand again after surgery.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.840
I really wanted to see
the outside world.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.320
See what's fun, and what's beautiful

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.870
out there.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.510
But heaven didn't give me that chance.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.160
I'm sorry.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.080
I didn't know about your legs.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.270
I was too careless.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.630
I touched on something painful.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:08.790
I really am sorry.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.120
It's okay.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.600
I'm the one who's too sensitive.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.000
I...

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.670
I shouldn't have reacted like that.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.030
I'm sorry.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.080
You can yell at me

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.480
if it makes you feel better.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.990
I...

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:28.840
I'm a little tired.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.630
Let's...

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.270
Let's stop here for today.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.380
(Inpatient)

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.000
Hello. I've paid the fees.

00:09:53.066 --> 00:09:54.355
I'm here to pick up the receipt.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.350
Wait here.

00:09:55.377 --> 00:09:56.710
I'll go pick up the prescription.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.750
Are you there?

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.870
He Yiyao?

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.960
He Yiyao?

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.030
Shh! Keep it down.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.960
I'm at the hospital.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.870
Look in the mirror.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.040
Just one look.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:19.270
Give me a moment.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.240
Take one pill twice a day,

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.150
morning and night.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.750
Are you there, He Yiyao?

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.080
He Yiyao!

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.240
What is it?

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.977
Keep your voice down.
I'm in a hospital.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.480
I upset you last time.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.960
So this time,
I've got a surprise for you.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.040
Look.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.200
Is this what mountains and rivers
looked like in ancient times?

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.160
Yes.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.110
Li Yansheng,

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.360
what are you doing?

00:11:05.511 --> 00:11:07.240
I had craftsmen modify it
just for this.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.350
What do you think?

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:10.750
He Yiyao,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.150
even if you can't walk,

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.150
you can still see this world.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.000
I'll be your legs.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.440
I have to go out tomorrow.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.910
I'll ask the granny next door
to look after you.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:00.960
Mom,

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.910
I'll go with you.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.800
Really?

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.240
You want to go out?

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.080
Okay.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.870
I'll take you with me tomorrow.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.280
Keep it flat and straight.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.350
Look. These are millet cakes.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.510
This is dried meat.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.790
You can put the meat

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:05.840
inside the cake,

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.680
like this.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.680
Like this?

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.550
This is called a hamburger.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.030
It's food from our time.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.320
It's good, right?

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.000
It is quite good.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.440
What is this?

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:32.790
That's incredible.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.480
This is a modern

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.920
desk lamp.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:38.750
It's magical.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.480
Does your mirror have
a scratch like this, too?

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.080
No.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.240
What's this?

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.390
Look.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.000
Don't these two dots look like eyes?

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.000
And this curve.

00:14:14.044 --> 00:14:15.270
Doesn't it look like a mouth?

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.280
It does.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.270
I'm going to sleep now.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:26.670
I'm on duty tonight.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.200
Get some rest.

00:14:42.229 --> 00:14:43.510
So pretty...

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.400
This is a modern way of getting around.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.270
It's a bicycle.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.270
This is my horse.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.360
Its name is Feiying.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.870
It's nice to meet you, Feiying.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.040
Did you know?

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.150
After Feiying's full,
it likes to dance.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.440
Dance?

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.550
That's impressive.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.240
Wait. I'll make it dance for you.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.510
Cute!

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.790
We've been watching her for days now.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.480
She's gone from that state to this.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.870
Bizhi,

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.150
can I ask you something?

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:53.960
Go ahead.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.160
Look how happy

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:57.790
she is now.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.750
Can you bear to take
that happiness away?

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.240
Well, can we

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.670
wait a little longer

00:16:04.266 --> 00:16:06.270
before taking back
the Fish-patterned Mirror?

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.280
We can.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:10.510
That's great!

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.750
I knew you were a good,

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:12.590
reasonable person.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:17.600
But General Li

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.750
will die someday.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.320
You've seen it.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.720
Everyone and everything

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.240
must part someday.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.390
You'll get used to it.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.600
Li Yansheng,

00:16:53.044 --> 00:16:54.670
there's something I want to say to you.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.960
The thing is...

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.360
I...

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.030
You can feel it, right?

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.270
What I feel for you...

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.760
Yao.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.150
- I...
- You...

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.400
You go first.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.110
I've been promoted

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:32.240
to General of Valiant Cavalry.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.480
Really?

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.510
That's amazing!

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.350
I led the troops
straight in and launched

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.955
a surprise attack on their stronghold.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.030
Yao,

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:41.870
I did it.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.240
You did it!

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.480
You're a general in name
and in fact now.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.910
Of course.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.560
Oh, right.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.760
Look.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.160
They're celebrating.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.400
Our men fought bravely.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.510
Never thought it'd go so well.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.800
Right.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.880
What were you about to say just now?

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:11.480
I wanted to say...

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.270
Actually...

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.270
I've been thinking about you.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.530
- What I feel for you...
- Yao,

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.830
it's too noisy here.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:24.960
I couldn't hear clearly.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.270
What did you say?

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:29.630
Nothing.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:30.630
It's not important.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.310
We'll talk about it next time.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.280
All right.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.520
Behind you!

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.800
Li Yansheng!

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.800
Li Yansheng!

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.190
Li Yansheng?

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.080
Li Yansheng!

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:07.870
Are you there, Li Yansheng?

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:09.670
Li Yansheng!

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.110
Here's the book, Miss.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.950
Thank you.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.400
So

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.920
General Li is gone?

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.640
Should we tell her?

00:20:18.244 --> 00:20:19.830
She needs to know sooner or later.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.590
Are you okay?

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.880
Let me help you up.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.800
Careful.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.800
Thank you.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.110
Thank you.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:19.750
It's you guys.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.160
We're here for the mirror.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.000
I expected this would be the ending.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.640
I just didn't expect him

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.480
to leave so suddenly.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.880
I know you must be hurting.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.790
Cry if you need to.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:57.680
He fulfilled his ideals

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.720
and lived out his ambitions.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.440
I should be happy for him.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.160
I should be.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.960
I'm just angry at myself,

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.400
for not being braver,

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.640
for not being more honest.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.640
If I'd told him sooner...

00:22:24.222 --> 00:22:25.640
I'll never have another chance.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.200
He'll never know.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.720
Even if he didn't know how you felt,

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.030
General Li treasured

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:37.400
that mirror.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.510
It must've been because of you.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.160
He may be gone,

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.830
but the mirror is my most
precious possession.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.750
I don't want to give it to anyone.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.640
But this mirror

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.510
doesn't belong in this era.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:05.590
I'm sorry.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.680
She loves Li Yansheng so much.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.720
How could she possibly
give us the mirror?

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.880
He Yiyao!

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.422
Never mind the mirror.

00:23:31.422 --> 00:23:33.400
Whether we get it back
or not doesn't matter.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.070
But I want you to know this.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.200
If Li Yansheng could see you now,

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.160
he wouldn't want you to be

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.550
in so much pain.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.160
He'd want you

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.110
to be happy.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:51.310
You have to be happy!

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.590
I'm sorry.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:11.270
I shouldn't have decided on my own.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.160
You don't need to apologize to me.

00:24:17.266 --> 00:24:19.350
All of this is because
the Fish-patterned Mirror

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.750
shouldn't link different timelines.

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:24.720
Even though it didn't harm He Yiyao,

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.240
it would alter her fate.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.240
The butterfly effect

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.160
could even change
the course of history.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.720
If someone's at fault,

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.960
it's me.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:40.920
Why?

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:50.960
Where are you heading?

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.590
I don't know.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.550
I'm just wandering.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.440
Then, let's travel together.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.000
Such fine days shouldn't be wasted.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.790
I'll take you somewhere.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.950
Come on!

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.430
This way.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.880
Why did you stop?

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:23.160
What flowers are those?

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:25.880
Those are locust flowers.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.400
This is Huai City.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.510
Students from
the Imperial Academy live here,

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:33.830
each with their texts,

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:34.750
trading books,

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.000
lecturing, and debating ideas.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.590
I like this place.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.550
These are bamboo slips.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.644
Embracing Sand, Crossing the River,

00:25:44.644 --> 00:25:46.977
The Outpouring of Sad Thoughts,
and Thinking of a Fair One.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.240
Have you read these works?

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.560
I have,

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.200
but not in this form.

00:25:58.866 --> 00:26:00.070
This is Crossing the River.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.920
It's my favorite.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.000
If you're interested,

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.350
you should read it sometime.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:08.590
Thank you.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.950
Here you go.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.480
We met by chance.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.920
I wouldn't harm you.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.760
Eat up.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.920
You look like you've never eaten one.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.040
Have some tea.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.240
Be careful. It's hot.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.160
I don't even know
how to address you yet.

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:41.030
I can tell you're from elsewhere.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:42.670
Well, then.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.270
Meeting is fate.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:46.720
Let's call

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.310
each other friends.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:49.150
What do you say?

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.920
Friends?

00:27:53.177 --> 00:27:54.990
How shall it be said
that you have no clothes?

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.480
I will share my robes with you.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:58.350
A friend is someone

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.030
who walks part of life's journey

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.400
with you.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.270
Even if it's only for a short stretch,

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.310
it's a blessing.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:12.870
To you, my friend.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.070
To you, my friend.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.880
(That night,)

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.350
(I tasted my first pastry,)

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.160
(my first sip of tea,)

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.920
(and made)

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.880
(my first friend.)

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.830
Fear not.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.320
Stop!

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.750
We're searching for someone.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.360
I didn't order you to draw your blades.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.320
Put those away!

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:01.840
Young Master,

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.310
you really put me through a search.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:05.920
After you left,

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.790
the residence fell into chaos.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.790
Caiwei was severely punished
for covering for your escape.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.040
Young Master,

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:13.200
please come back

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.070
with me.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.160
Who might this be?

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:26.350
We're friends.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:27.200
Ask no further.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.480
Understood.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.040
Young Master,
on the sixth day of next month,

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.790
you'll undergo your coming
of age ceremony.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:34.310
The date's been set.

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:35.680
It can't be delayed.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:38.840
Huo Shu.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:41.790
Do you know why I ran away?

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.790
You have your own reasons.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.240
I don't know them.

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:48.880
After the ceremony,

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.310
I'll have to shoulder my family's duty.

00:29:51.688 --> 00:29:53.590
I'll never be able to live
as I please again.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.110
You say you care about me,

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.350
so how can you push me
into a life of restriction?

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:04.000
Young Master,

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.310
my life is yours.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.720
But I can't disobey

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.830
the late master's wishes.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.000
If you refuse,

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.960
I'll have to bind you
and take you back.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.550
Fine.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.110
This trip's lasted over half a month.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.240
There's nothing left for me to see.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.750
It's time for me to go back.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.720
Quick, help him mount the horse!

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.000
Please, Young Master.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.070
I must return now.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.400
We'll share liquor another day

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.510
and talk through the night.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.440
On the seventh day of next month,

00:30:57.644 --> 00:30:59.000
at Shuyu Restaurant in Luoyang,

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.030
ask for Willow Dweller.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:02.920
Don't forget.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.760
Let's go.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.550
Take care.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.620
(Shuyu Restaurant)

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.270
Is Willow Dweller here?

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.960
Please follow me, Sir.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.080
Please, step into the carriage.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:09.860
(Qin Residence)

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.380
(Qin Residence)

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:29.390
My friend!

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.790
I knew you'd keep your word.

00:32:41.022 --> 00:32:43.590
Young Master, you've completed
your coming of age ceremony.

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:44.933
Please observe proper etiquette.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.000
My friend, it's as if you've ascended
Kunlun and fed on jade essence.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.510
May you share longevity
with heaven and earth

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.180
and shine as brightly
as the sun and moon.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:03.270
You've already memorized

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.590
Crossing the River,

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:06.022
and now you're teasing me with it.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.110
I'm not teasing.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.790
Those are words from my heart.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.550
You're a whole other person

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.480
since our last meeting.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.350
Wait.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.510
Let me take you somewhere first.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.640
All right?

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.480
All right.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.960
This is my treasure trove.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.520
These are

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.110
all my collections from over the years.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.960
I never expected you

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.550
to have collected
so many rare treasures.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:46.920
I love collecting.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:49.510
Everyone knows this about me.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.240
They all think

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.830
I'm idle and unambitious.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.480
You don't seem to care
about that reputation.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.800
Why?

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.110
The world takes pride in noble lineage.

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:10.030
To me,

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.150
high-born families

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.480
are nothing but shackles.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.280
Factional struggles

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.030
and clan wars

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.760
are just passing clouds.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:24.630
All I hope for

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.400
is that one day,

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.230
I'll be free.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.630
Break those chains,

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.190
and live as you please.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:36.360
That is the life.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.320
How odd.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.400
With you, I can speak
my heart so easily.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.670
You're different
from Huo Shu and Caiwei.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.670
Whether in hardship

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.800
or in glory,

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:56.960
you don't seem to care.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.360
As if you're not bound
by worldly rules at all.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:03.840
I know you can't reveal your name.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:06.400
But should you ever run into trouble,

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.000
come find me here
at the Qin Residence in Luoyang.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.000
My surname is Qin.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.030
My given name is Ziyi.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:19.400
Ziyi.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:20.510
My friend.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.800
(What I'm looking for
are things that belong to you.)

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:29.190
Because I went back to the past

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.480
and disrupted the order of time,

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.110
they appeared in eras

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.760
where they didn't belong.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.360
And because of me,
they developed abnormal energy.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.550
I don't want them
to affect more people.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.440
I must retrieve them.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.630
That's why He Yiyao
and Li Yansheng were able

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:55.880
to see each other
through those two mirrors.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.920
There was ever only one mirror.

00:35:59.355 --> 00:36:00.780
Shouldn't there have been two?

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:01.630
No.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.960
After Li Yansheng died, the mirror

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.150
passed into different hands,

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:06.320
and over the years,

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.030
it eventually ended up with He Yiyao.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.120
Does that mean

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.670
I could also see people from the past

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:13.230
through that mirror?

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:14.070
No.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.990
I understand.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:19.070
The rules, right?

00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:21.400
It's because people in the past
didn't have that mirror.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.800
Then, if people in the past
also had the mirror,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.230
would it work?

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.310
No.

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:33.150
Why not?

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.000
Because of the rules.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.710
Do you think she'll give us the mirror?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.320
Waiting here every day
isn't a solution.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.680
Yao.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.640
Mom,

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.190
I'd like to talk to them.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.920
Could you reconsider?

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.320
Didn't you say

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.070
the mirror

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:49.400
was your most precious possession?

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.800
How could you...

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:01.440
(Does your mirror have
a scratch like this too?)

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.190
No.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.440
What's this?

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.600
Look.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.190
Don't these two dots look like eyes?

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:15.190
And this curve.

00:38:15.244 --> 00:38:16.480
Doesn't it look like a mouth?

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.670
(Yao,)

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.960
(even if I'm gone,)

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.440
(you have to keep living with a smile.)

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.000
Li Yansheng...

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:57.630
Did you carve this for me?

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:02.550
(That day, you told me)

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.590
that if Li Yansheng could see me,

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.190
he'd want me to be happy.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.240
I think

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.000
what he wanted to tell me in the end

00:39:15.933 --> 00:39:17.710
was that even if
he wasn't here anymore,

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.400
I could still face
the rest of my life with a smile.

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:26.400
So this mirror
