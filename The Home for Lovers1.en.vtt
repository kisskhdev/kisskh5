00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.390
Good work.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.110
You're early today.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.110
Wasting time diving after every investigation.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.610
Not a waste of time at all.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.640
I have something to do later.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.190
I see.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.670
Hello

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.790
I've arrived.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.120
Long journey, must be tired.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.290
The eco-guide we arranged will pick you up soon.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.280
Eco-guide.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.780
A young guy who helped us with photo shoots before.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.310
Young but spirited.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.270
Now I'm just left here getting in the way.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.030
Don't say that.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.670
He'll surely help you finish your writing smoothly.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.430
Hey!

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.700
I have a bad feeling.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.730
Rakumoto-san.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.990
Rakumoto-san.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.970
Cancel.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.050
Cancel it for me.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.680
Got hung up on.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.610
Are you Ai Rakumoto-san?

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.500
Don't call my name

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.070
I'll be found out.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.110
Be found out?

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.370
Don't you know who I am?

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.090
You're Ai-san, right?

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.140
Nice to meet you.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.070
I'm your eco-guide, Kaishin Muto.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.120
Kaishin means "heart of the sea".

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.620
Well then.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.010
Let's go to the inn.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.280
Ah! What.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.370
Are you kidding me?

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.480
Huh?

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.210
How could I ride in such an embarrassing vehicle?

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.810
Unbelievable.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.610
Can't even fit the luggage in.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.400
Do you know how much this costs?

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.030
You'd have to pay if it breaks.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.920
- Hurry up and get another vehicle.
- Take about an hour.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.390
Can you wait?

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.780
Put over.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.530
Do you understand?

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.760
I'm going back.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.340
Ahh.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.680
We're here.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.070
I want the earliest boat back.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.050
Arrange it for me.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.000
You just arrived

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.440
I never wanted to come.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.630
Then why did you come?

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.000
That's because

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.480
new work.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.140
Mm-hmm.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.250
What?

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.620
New novel.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.340
Well...

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.700
I can't quite write it.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.180
Kind of like.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.360
Writer's block.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.970
That story

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.840
takes place on a small island.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.950
Something about "a Teacher who only knows cities
should experience island life".

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.490
Idiot editor bought a boat ticket.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.090
Half-forced me to come.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.370
So sleep-deprived and seasick.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.490
And then.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.860
Met another idiot picking me up.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.710
Have secretary arrange it.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:31.640
What?

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.680
One week later.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.410
Next boat is in a week.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.260
You're kidding.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.570
No no no no!

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.340
There must be other ways besides boats.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.240
Anything will do.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.870
Hurry and let me leave.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.490
So beautiful.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.570
Welcome Ai-san

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.740
to our island.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.800
"Love Sea The Home for Lovers"
(Episode 1)

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.410
Anything else you need?

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.570
I don't understand the dialect.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.500
I said.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.680
- Anything else you need help with?
- So you can speak normally.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.180
Get out.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.240
Go away.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.020
Room key is here.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:34.950
Contact me if you need anything.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.550
My contact info

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.710
is by the bed.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.740
See you.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.030
Thank you.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.640
Okay.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.540
Cheers.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.320
Every night at the bar.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.380
Exciting things happen.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.210
Tonight for sure, too.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.230
Tonight's star just shows up.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.230
Please have a seat.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.060
What would you like?

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.230
Anything strong?

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:30.820
Oh...

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.720
How about Heart of the Sea?

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.250
Heart of the Sea.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.200
Kaishin.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.870
Other than that.

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:38.940
Anything is fine.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.550
Sir.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.420
Are you big brother's eco-guide customer?

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.890
You

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.200
are that guide's younger brother

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.510
I'm his younger brother.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:47.580
My name is Kouya.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.900
But everyone calls me Ham.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.310
Bar customers all want to hear about
my big brother from me.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.000
Just like you.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:55.730
Huh?

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.830
Who?

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.710
Big brother's super popular on the island.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.750
Handsome and cool.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.490
Even foreign girls fall for him.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.470
Not just girls.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.650
Big Brother.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.480
Guys are okay, too.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.870
Why tell me this

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.050
I thought you were curious.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:14.770
Not at all.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.810
I'm leaving then.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.150
Wait.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:21.740
- See, you are curious after all.
- No.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.310
Why do you think I'd be curious?

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:28.250
Well...

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.740
I just wanted everyone to know.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.150
Kaishin is the island's specialty.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.690
Ham.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.780
I'm not ordering.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.180
If that guy's the specialty.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.930
This island is doomed.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.480
- Morning, Kaishin.
- Morning.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.860
- Safe walk to school.
- Thank you.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.150
Alright.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:58.780
Okay.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.820
Fixed it up. Tell me if
the cat breaks it again.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.630
Thanks.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.850
Stay for lunch.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.380
Ah, no thanks!

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.770
Not today.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.000
I have a cat at home now.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.510
Good morning.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.710
So bright.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.220
Sun's hitting your butt.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:46.170
You.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.230
How did you get in?

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:47.860
Hm?

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.150
Spare key

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.160
I'll report you for trespassing.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.040
No.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.500
This is also my job.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.400
Huh?

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.910
Stubborn and moody.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.480
Gets weak and dies when lonely.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.470
So the request I got

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.110
is to take care of you day and night.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.140
Don't writers have human rights?

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.750
Hand over the key.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.650
Geez.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.650
So pale.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.010
Writers really don't go outside.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.980
Want to see?

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.000
Eh?

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:56.780
I can show you.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.500
So pale!

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.490
So pale.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:35.850
Huh?

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.680
So smooth.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.870
Hair removal?

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.980
Or laser?

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.290
Does it itch after?

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.020
When I had it done.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.090
It was so itchy.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:47.380
Excuse me.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.500
Eh?

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.970
Wow! Like a peeled pear!

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.360
This is like an apple.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.290
Do you have a fever?

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.910
Take medicine if you feel bad.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.360
Don't you feel anything?

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.120
Nothing at all?

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.680
What?

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:10.990
You.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:11.710
Get out.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:12.930
Get lost now.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.670
Sorry.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:15.840
Ai.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.020
Ai-san.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.150
Don't call me.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:23.950
Sweat stains won't come out.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.690
Said he could handle guys.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:34.820
Ai.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.120
Even if he were the last man on earth.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.860
Absolutely no!

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.830
Yes.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.290
Thank you.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.030
Rakumoto has always been in your care.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.050
He is currently writing on the island.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.730
No, next month's book fair is no problem

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:04.170
I'll call back later, sorry.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:09.980
Thank you for calling.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.740
About the contract

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.340
I'll be right back.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.430
Oh no.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.350
Thank you for your support.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.730
He is writing on the island currently.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.510
Ai isn't there?

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.450
When will he be back?

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.990
(Himeka Ui)

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.700
Himeka-san!

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.290
Hey, when will he be back?

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:51.810
Next week

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.200
I heard he'll definitely return.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.800
Hmm, I see.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.480
That means Fumi is free.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.390
That's not what I mean.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.490
I'm not that free.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.680
Why not?

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.480
Popular writer's not around secretary should be free.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.270
As Ai's friend

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.260
I'll give you work in his place.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.020
Spare me

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.380
I've said many times I'm the teacher's secretary

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.400
- I'm not Himeka-san's secretary.
- Light bulb burned out.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:21.830
What?

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.650
I hate dark rooms.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.410
Change it when you're free.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.270
Why me?

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.000
Fumi is Ai's secretary.

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.270
Yeah.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.570
So?

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.880
Ai owns several houses

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.710
I rent from him, too.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.500
When the landlord can't handle it, who should?

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.550
No.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:43.970
Even so.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.140
Contractors are expensive and scary.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.320
What if I get hurt doing it myself.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:50.470
Himeka-san.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.350
Please get ready.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.500
Can't drill holes in wall decorations.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.030
Please, Fumi.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.290
Island specialty tomorrow's leaf mixed kelp pasta, enjoy.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:09.850
Leave me alone.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:10.670
Meow.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.460
Huh?

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.890
This won't do.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.570
- I got paid.
- I told you.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:16.430
Stop using that dialect.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.150
I don't want this either.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.850
Just eat.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.560
Bacon and eggs.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.170
Don't like bacon and eggs either.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.780
Seafood udon noodles.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.530
Too heavy for morning.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:35.990
If it's salad.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:45.700
Tasty?

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:47.790
No, thanks.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.360
Since you made it.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:51.770
You eat the rest.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.000
It's all you can eat.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.610
Lucky.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.420
Ai-san is beautiful and kind.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.130
So nice.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.350
- Pure heart like a white cat.
- How much to shut you up?

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.630
Money can't buy me.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.570
Though big money is different.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:14.840
Huh.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.050
My account.

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:17.620
I thought you weren't interested.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:18.940
How about 20,000?

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:20.410
Huh?

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.960
Can you not talk like that?

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.300
30,000

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.890
40,000

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:33.730
How about 50,000.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.690
Too cheap for you?

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:39.800
Not at all

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:41.380
20,000 is fine.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.910
Aren't you upset being looked down on?

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:47.960
Not at all?

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.070
I'm happy you'd spend money on me.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:58.780
That's wonderful, Ai.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.360
You found someone you liked.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.090
Himeka, are you listening?

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.490
Because.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.500
If you sleep with that boy, can't you write?

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:16.270
A novelist who can't write love scenes

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.730
without passionate nights with new partners.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.580
Who can save him from trouble

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.740
is a wild youth raised on the island.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.720
Not bad.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.870
I won't sleep with him.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:29.070
Huh?

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.300
Even though

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.360
how do you write without sleeping with others?

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:36.150
I'll find someone else.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.570
Caught by that gaze with tears flowing down tense cheeks.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.290
Suddenly I felt a deep pain in chest.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.640
Mysteriously confused.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.720
Why want to hold that slender waist.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.830
Why can't resist this person's tears.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:16.940
What is love?

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:19.030
Philosophy?

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.000
You're so noisy.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.670
Get out, I'm working.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.160
Hey!

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.690
Take a little break.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:40.560
Is this part of the job, too?

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.310
Yeah.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.960
Resting is a living being's duty.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.690
Dangerous to fall.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.620
I'm not a child.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.010
Hey, Fumi?

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:34.380
Hello.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.640
Can't hear.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.010
We're at sea.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.110
No signal here.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.980
Shut up.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.910
I'm being nice telling you.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.760
Fumi?

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.210
I can't hear you!

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.520
Text me if you can.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.690
Can't hear.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:55.810
Did you hear?

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:57.400
Ah!

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:00.680
Can't hear you!

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.580
Hey!!

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.270
No way.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.370
Hey! Guide.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.040
Did that idiot fall into the sea?

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.150
Kaishin.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.240
Kai~shin~.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.380
Kaishin.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.280
Kaishin.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:36.440
No way.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:41.800
Ai-san

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.610
I just caught this, let's eat together when we get back.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.180
What's wrong?

00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.340
Are you crying?

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:00.880
Why?

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.620
So annoying.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.870
Because I suddenly disappeared.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:13.880
You were on the phone

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.530
so I didn't tell you.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:19.130
I was rude.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.640
You'd be angry again.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:25.450
I'm sorry.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:27.600
Sorry.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:32.670
Don't cry.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.070
Wipe your tears.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.800
I thought you fell in the sea.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.410
Maybe never coming back.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.810
You might die.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.470
No matter how annoying you are.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.440
I don't want to see you die.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.170
Even if you

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.330
died of a heart attack

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.580
I'd want to see it myself.

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:13.190
Let go.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:15.860
Sorry.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:22.870
Your clothes are cold.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.480
I'm sorry.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:32.320
I won't run off again.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:34.970
Don't worry.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.580
Here.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:58.690
This

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.660
for your swollen eyes.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.040
Nobody asked you.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.450
Right

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.740
I didn't ask Ai-san either

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.230
to cry for me.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.240
Why are you undressing?

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:14.740
Because they are wet.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.070
Who told you to jump in?

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.130
I wanted to show you something nice.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.000
I meant the turban shells.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:29.320
Which would you rather eat?

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:30.840
Shut up.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.300
Though

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.860
I can probably guess.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.700
- What you want to eat is...
- Narcissist.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.830
Can't help being too handsome

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.230
I'm the handsome one!

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.820
I admit that.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:44.380
Hey.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:45.150
Which one?

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:47.060
Turban shells.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:48.900
Or.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.050
Kaishin.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.470
So

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.360
weird name.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:55.740
What's the origin?

00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:59.050
What about Ai-san's?

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.730
Your name is special.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.860
I asked first.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.830
Because it matches your name.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:08.240
What?

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.120
Is there something wrong with your Japanese?

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.180
How does it match?

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:13.720
Someday.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.180
You'll fall in love with the ocean.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.870
Love it from your heart.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.420
You must love the sea from your heart.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.970
How boring.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:55.840
Love is just delusion.

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.120
I'm hungry.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.200
What you mentioned.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:03.360
Turban shells.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:04.820
Hurry and make them.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:06.640
Got it.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.740
Come.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:08.600
Stand up.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:10.860
I can stand by myself.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.110
Don't pull me.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:14.060
You're really shy.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.380
What?

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:16.720
Meow.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.500
Stop the dialect.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.350
It's a cat.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.250
Meow.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.890
Want to see?

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.240
I can show you.

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:36.520
I want to see.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:39.670
Huh.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:43.670
It's a dream
