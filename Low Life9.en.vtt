The former world boxing champion…

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.806
{\an8}Chief, the government's
coming to do a third round of salvage.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.725
Oh, yeah? When's that?

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:21.980
It says May 16th, so…

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:23.565
Hey, what's today's date?

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.150
Uh… May 8th.

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:26.485
I guess next week then.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:28.070
Would you look at that timing?

00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:32.574
Sanjeong-dong Precinct.

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:34.576
Honggi,
how could this happen?

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.661
What?

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:37.955
Oh, it's just terrible. Oh!

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:45.295
What do we do?

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.173
- Oh, Honggi. How could he…
- Where is he?

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.425
He's in there.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:57.975
Oh, my poor boy!
He was my one and only…

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:02.062
He's so cold and alone in there.

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:08.402
My baby!

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:18.078
Oh. Shit.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:25.961
When did you get here?

00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:28.255
Why's Beolgu so bloated?

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:29.965
He was in the water for a while.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:32.217
You do know
that he washed up on the shore, right?

00:01:32.718 --> 00:01:33.719
What killed him then?

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.262
Well, they say he drowned,

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:38.181
but on the back of his head, it looks
to me like he took one hell of a hit.

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:48.734
Maybe he slammed into the rocks.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.156
Beolgu grew up by the sea.
It's kinda odd he'd drown.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.490
Hey, Honggi. Listen.

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:58.869
You know the Seoul folk
my uncle's been working with, right?

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.663
Now they're doing their looting
in full view. You ain't stopping it?

00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:05.208
What, are you a police officer?
Let us handle the Seoul folks.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.795
You strut around
like you're a big shot officer,

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.797
but you haven't really done anything.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.759
Beolgu. You know he was hanging out
with those guys.

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:17.471
- What are you saying?
- Honggi! Honggi! Where are you?

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:20.432
- Honggi! Honggi, over here!
- What?

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.184
Shit. Gimme some room.

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:24.519
Here, carefully! Put her up here for now.

00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:27.481
Hey, bring some cold water!

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:32.486
- Cold water! Shit. Damn. This is nuts.
- Give her some air.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:08.415
{\an8}- Not too fast! Slow down.
You can thank me later.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.277
Mmm.

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.519
Oh!

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.521
Fuck, yeah!

00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:20.362
Let's get it out, now!

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.739
All right, let's go.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:24.157
Put the good ones over there.

00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:26.284
You see better without all the mud, man?

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:28.078
Yeah, that's for sure.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.997
It's still gonna take a long time
to get it all out.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:32.958
Hey, this one looks great! See?

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.626
The intact ones over here.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.253
And don't throw away
the chipped ones either.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.004
- Leave them together.
- Hey, hey! Here!

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:39.339
- Take this.
- Whoa, shit.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:43.260
- Oh, wow. Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, my word. What on earth?

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.846
All right.

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:47.806
- Yeah, here we go.
- And here, again!

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.184
- Give it here. Yeah. Yeah!
- Just put it over there.

00:05:51.268 --> 00:05:54.396
- Pull! Pull!
- Over there. Careful, careful.

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.897
Yeah!

What's your deal?
Did someone die or something?

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.617
Your sulking's getting on my nerves.

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.418
Hi. Good Luck Coffee.

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:18.837
Hi, I'm calling
from Amjado. Owner there?

00:06:20.297 --> 00:06:21.464
It's for you, Madam Jang.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.508
What is it now?

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:28.680
Hi, how can I help you?

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.851
It's me. Come and get your damn girl.
You can keep the money.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.228
Why? What's going on?

00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:38.565
I don't want her here.
She keeps trying to kill herself.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.320
I'm done. Just come and get her.
I don't need this shit.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.739
You're such an idiot.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:50.660
Doesn't matter if you bleed out or not.
No one's ever going to care.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.543
I already counted these ones here.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.129
Shit.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.506
- Starting to look pretty full in here.
- Oh, shit.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.508
- It's looking pretty good.
- Be careful.

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.552
- Anyway, where was I?
- Hey, what you saying--

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:12.724
We pulled up over one hundred pieces
today, and if we add it all up.

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:16.978
Then, we pulled out 389!

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:19.773
We're running out of space
to hold them all.

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:22.317
Well, the shed in Muan that I found
will fit everything,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.110
and we can clean the salt off there.

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:25.195
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.905
Hey, if we're gonna move
all these at once,

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.615
we'll need a big truck
at the very least, right?

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:29.699
Yeah, that's right.

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:33.370
In Mokpo, no one's gonna care,
but in Muan, it might draw attention.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.413
No, there's tons
of trucks over there.

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.041
Muan's famous for shipping
around all the garlic and onion.

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:39.125
- Oh, yeah?
- True.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:40.293
- We should be in the clear then.
- Yeah.

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.462
All right, cool. Yeah.

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:45.131
Okay.
I need your thumbprints here.

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:47.300
- Can we talk for a minute?
- What?

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:48.426
- All right, here.
- Yeah.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.969
I need your thumbprint, just right there.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.304
- Okay. I got it.
- You too, Hwang.

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:53.181
- Captain Hwang. Come here.
- What?

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:54.391
Huh?

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.518
Why don't we take some of this
to Seoul instead of Muan?

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:57.477
Why?

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.230
I don't see the point of just leaving it
sitting in a shed like this.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.899
The chairman's wife said
she'll buy it from us.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.026
Heedong.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.570
The way to go
is selling it all at once. Okay?

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:08.780
Not little by little like that.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:11.533
We don't even know
if she still wants the stuff.

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:14.160
If we sell a few we could
at least guarantee a little cash.

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:15.829
What's gotten you so impatient?

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:20.625
I need money.

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:25.255
How much?

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:28.133
A million.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:31.928
- What do you need it for?
- I just need it. Don't ask.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:33.930
I can't help you right now, kid.

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.891
I got a plan already in the works,
so just sit tight.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:39.227
You think a million is just pocket change?

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.688
- Let's move it up there.
- Done with your thumbprints?

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:43.690
- Yeah.
- Give it to me.

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:46.151
Hwang, can you find us a truck?

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:49.112
- A big one.
- Yeah. Don't worry. I got it.

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:06.254
He's not getting
any better. What do we do?

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:11.384
I'm not sure. I didn't think
this would drag on for so long.

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.179
I didn't realize
one night of overdrinking

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.514
would knock him down like this.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.934
- Hey, go ahead.
- Sir.

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.691
I'm a bit concerned about his brain,

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.818
but X-rays limit what we can see.

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:33.323
Sometime this fall, Yeonhui University
Hospital is getting a CT scanner.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:34.866
We can see things better with that.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:38.203
Japan has those.
What's the use of waiting around here?

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.413
Unfortunately, flying's off the table.
There's too much risk.

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:42.165
Well, we can't let it get worse.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.709
At his age,

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:47.337
there aren't many options available.

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.590
He needs to get back to work.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.762
Speaking of work,

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:58.932
I heard you carried out
a major restructuring.

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.309
Yes, we had personnel changes.

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:03.394
Are you stepping in and overseeing things?

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:04.813
No. What do I know?

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.482
I do simple things.
Only on my husband's behalf.

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.067
Oh.

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:11.486
But if it came down to it,

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.906
you would take over the company
in his stead, wouldn't you?

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:19.744
Why not? If I can do the job well,
I should.

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:22.872
Seems like you're not very
hopeful about the chairman's condition.

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:25.875
I don't know.
Things haven't been looking good.

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.002
No, you're right.

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.382
The next three weeks
will be very critical for him.

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.259
He'll be recovered in three weeks?

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:38.138
Not quite. That time frame
will tell us if he'll be able to make it.

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:40.431
Is that really it?

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:44.686
Hmm. Are you saying that he won't?

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:48.690
I'm saying if that's
what you want, it could be possible.

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:50.191
Wait a second.

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:52.443
Why would I ever want that? Hmm?

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:55.029
Of course. Who could ever consider it?

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:59.200
But maybe, there's a chance that
the chairman's condition is too far gone.

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.707
Well, I believe I remember
the chairman saying,

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.126
he wanted to add a medical school
to his university.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:09.335
I bet.

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.629
A medical wing is quite essential.

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:12.922
For any university.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:16.176
Of course.

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.095
I look forward to working
with you, Chairwoman.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.597
Likewise.

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:23.224
Looking forward to it.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.936
Hey, wait!

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.021
Hey, Ma!

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.064
Hey, Ma!

00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:32.692
Is breakfast ready?
We're starving like crazy.

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:33.985
Crying out loud.

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:37.822
Your ma's working her butt off here!
Is food the only thing there is, huh?

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.991
I've had it up to here with this!

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.785
Food, food, food, all day with you.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.829
Hey, lady, they're kids.

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:46.748
That's just how they are.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.374
- That celadon?
- Yeah.

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:50.919
Then that goes over there.
Porcelain goes over there.

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:53.004
Separate jars and plates.

00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:55.131
- I got it.
- Come on. This way.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.927
Hot dang, guess we're rich now.
How much is all this?

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.429
Can't we just take them by boat?

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:04.349
Nah, there's a salt farm over that way,

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:05.975
so a boat won't work.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.936
Mokpo, let's take a truck there.

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:10.063
Damn it.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:11.397
Careful with those, please.

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.566
- That's money you're holding.
- Yeah.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:14.901
What's all this about?

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:17.987
The hell is going on here?

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.990
Got the whole damn village
working hard for you, don't you?

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.785
Honggi. We found a gold mine.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.249
Hey, guess you're not afraid of
the police cracking down on you.

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:31.668
Looks like you turned
this whole operation into a party.

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:35.213
All these folks are getting paid.
No one's forcing 'em into this.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.298
Look at 'em out there. It's a win-win.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.009
Where's Beolgu?

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.594
Oh.

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:44.806
Actually, we haven't seen him
in quite a while.

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:47.642
What are you talking about?
He was with you.

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:49.352
He didn't stick around for long.

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:50.520
Why?

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:54.357
Well, I shouldn't say this,
but you know how he is.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.984
Making trouble everywhere he goes.

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.403
Oh. Honggi.

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.114
Hey. You two, a word.

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:08.663
Where's Beolgu?
You guys are always together.

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:15.461
You must know where he is.

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:19.799
- Uh, well, the thing is, he said he was--
- We had a fight.

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:24.178
Not long after, he ran off.

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:26.514
Yeah, Honggi,
you know Beolgu can get like that.

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.392
And that was how long ago?

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:33.187
- Uh…
- I think ten days.

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:35.857
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- That's right.

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:37.775
Did Beolgu say where he was headed?

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:41.779
No, I don't know.
What's with all the questions?

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:46.617
Beolgu's dead, that's why.

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:47.744
What?

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:50.496
Oh, what the heck?

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:52.373
Oh, man.

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:00.339
All right.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:04.761
That's enough talking about this here.
You're all coming with me to the station.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:06.387
I need to look into this.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.266
Uh, Honggi, let's talk for a second.

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:12.018
Hey, hey.

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:13.102
Hands off.

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.022
Come on, man. We didn't do anything.

00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:18.733
Look, we'll figure everything out
once we investigate,

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:20.401
so let's go.

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:23.905
Hey, man, if anyone screwed anything up,
it would've been that kid.

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:24.989
So, what are you…

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:29.452
What are you trying to take us all in for?

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.246
I know… You know what he was like.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.457
Yeah, course I know.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:36.542
We are cousins.

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:43.257
And you, you were supposed to tell me
if anything went sideways.

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:44.634
Uh, hmm.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:48.096
You're coming in for questioning.
Let's get going.

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:50.556
Hey, let's not do this.

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.642
We're so close to being done.

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:54.852
Turn a blind eye if you can.

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:56.604
I'll make it worth your while.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:59.857
Walk away. You'll like the payout.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.736
Cut the crap, and let's go.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.572
I can't turn a blind eye this time.

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:12.495
Come on.

00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:16.290
What? Why you dawdlin'?

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:19.210
Should I get the cuffs out or what?

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:32.682
What?

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:37.436
{\an8}CHAIRMAN CHEON HWANGSIK

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:43.818
Enter.

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:50.449
{\an8}Do you like your new position?

00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:55.204
Actually, you have to bring back
the executives.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:56.747
Why?

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:58.666
Everything we have is under their names.

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:01.544
The factory site in Cheonan,
the farms in Chuncheon.

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:04.380
They're even tied to the slush funds,
which is the worst part.

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:06.799
Let's just take it all back then.

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:09.635
To do that, we'll either need their seals
or their consent,

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:11.220
and I wouldn't count on that.

00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:13.472
Oh, really?

00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:20.456
Hey, buddy.

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:23.209
You gotta eat something or you'll starve.

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:26.963
Shit, listen.
I'm about to piss myself here.

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:28.798
Untie me for a second.

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:30.466
Oh, I can't hold it.

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:33.803
- Okay. Come on. We'll go.
- Shit. I'm about to burst.

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:36.055
Fine. All right, here we go.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.896
All right, now. Could you untie me?

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.399
Yeah, I don't think that'd be a good idea.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.442
Mmm.

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:50.069
I could hold it for you then.

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:52.029
Ho-Hold it? What are you doing?

00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:55.032
It's not weird. We're both guys.
You think I'm gonna get a kick outta this?

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:57.618
Are you outta your fucking mind?
I'd rather piss myself instead!

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.203
Ah, sure, go ahead.

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.038
Guess that's a good way
to keep your legs warm.

00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:03.958
But seriously, you can't just be pissing
everywhere like an animal,

00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:06.002
- so here, you can use this--
- Fuck this shit!

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:07.837
Ah, shit.

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:12.466
- What? Where'd everything go?
- Man, you wanna just settle down already?

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.219
Let go. Let go of me. Shit.

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:18.848
Fine, go do whatever you want.

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:21.017
Piss yourself for all I care,
'cause I don't give a shit.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.728
Hey, guys from
the government are coming.

00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:25.187
You're gonna need me.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:26.856
Why are they coming?

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:29.191
It's obvious.
They wanna start digging too.

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:31.944
They're digging here too? Like when?

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:38.701
Oh, man.

00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:42.038
Careful! Get some more straw. Put it here.

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:44.874
Man, I don't know how well
these pieces will survive the ride.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:46.667
Oh, shit.

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:51.839
You were gonna sell me out earlier.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.633
The hell are you saying?

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:57.845
I saw how Honggi was trying to work you.
You were about to spill the beans.

00:18:57.928 --> 00:18:59.430
No, we weren't.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.057
You got no loyalty.

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:04.644
Can't blame me for not being able
to trust you sons of bitches.

00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:06.937
Funny to hear that from you.

00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:10.524
You really think you have any right
to say that to the both of us?

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:11.776
What the fuck?

00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:14.195
Hey, hey, hey. Knock it off.

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:15.446
Hey.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.531
Shit!

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.408
Is that all of it?

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.160
- Yeah, we're all set.
- Yeah.

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:22.995
- Okay.
- Dang, that was rough.

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:24.664
You can say that again.

00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:26.957
All right, then, shall we head out now?

00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:28.376
I'll ride back here.

00:19:28.459 --> 00:19:30.586
You'll bust your back though.
It's an hour away.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.505
I'll survive. Let's just go.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:35.966
- Being young sure is nice.
- All right, we're off now.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.135
- I'll see you all on Jeungdo.
- Okay. Safe trip.

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:39.804
Yeah, yeah.

00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:41.722
- See you later.
- Yeah.

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:43.432
All right.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.230
- Get in there. We gotta squeeze in.
- Come on.

00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:52.900
- Ah, dang, I'm fried.
- Here.

00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:55.736
Hey, go easy on the speed, all right?
Slow and steady.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.155
Relax, grandpa.
I'll have us crawling there.

00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.824
Anything breaks, it's your share.

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:02.660
Damn, you don't have to be
such a tight-ass.

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:06.706
Muan, here we come!

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:15.256
THE CHOHAN BANK

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:24.974
Go ahead and put it in 83.

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:26.892
Right.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.982
THE CHOHAN BANK

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:43.117
- Hello?
- Hi. Is the assemblyman in now?

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.201
He's not here right now.

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:46.454
I see.
Well, I'm the Heungbaek Chairman's wife.

00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:48.164
Would you be able to give him
a message for me?

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.248
Of course.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.125
- Just that the coffers are full.
- Coffers?

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:53.127
He'll understand what it means right away.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.671
- All right.
- All right, thank you very much.

00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:04.930
Hello, nice to meet you.
I'm the branch manager.

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:06.015
Oh, hi.

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:08.184
It's nice to finally meet you.
How do you do?

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.603
I realize I should've come in much sooner
to meet with you.

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:11.979
I do apologize.

00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:16.066
And by the way, I'm sorry to hear that
the chairman has been very ill as of late.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.527
Yes. It's been difficult.

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:21.030
Thank you for your concern.
I appreciate it.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:22.948
If you have a moment, please have a seat.

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:25.743
There's something we have to discuss.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:29.038
If you would. Thank you.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:36.170
Sorry for the need to speak with
you, especially during a time like this.

00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:38.589
Heungbaek has taken out
quite a substantial loan.

00:21:39.089 --> 00:21:41.884
I'm not sure
I'm following here.

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:45.429
Hypothetically speaking,
in a situation where the chairman passes,

00:21:45.513 --> 00:21:48.015
I'm afraid we'd have no choice
but to collect the full amount.

00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:50.267
- Right away?
- Yes.

00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:52.186
The loan was meant for him,
not anyone else.

00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:55.898
Even if that's the case, I mean
we're talking about a corporate--

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:58.192
The only reason we extended
the loan to the chairman

00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:00.194
was because he was a VIP client of ours.

00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:03.322
That's why if he were to suddenly pass,
we would have no other option.

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:07.326
So you walk away
when there's nothing left to gain?

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:08.953
Look, ma'am,

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:12.289
you're aware that Heungbaek is
struggling financially, right?

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.543
- What?
- Honestly, the only reason

00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:18.045
we haven't called in the loan is
because we knew the chairman.

00:22:22.842 --> 00:22:25.386
We've been in deficit every year.

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.972
That's why we've had to borrow so much.

00:22:28.472 --> 00:22:30.224
And what of his Yeouido project?

00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:32.726
When things got tough,
he wanted to branch out a little.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.353
The loan he took out was massive.

00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:39.024
Get me all the loan records you have.

00:22:42.987 --> 00:22:45.614
It wasn't just the banks.
He borrowed from private lenders too.

00:22:45.698 --> 00:22:47.741
Interest rates were good
during the August 3rd debt freeze,

00:22:47.825 --> 00:22:50.995
but they've been spiking since last year.
We've been struggling to keep up.

00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:53.205
What the hell was he thinking?

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:55.374
Who are these private lenders?

00:22:55.457 --> 00:22:57.042
Well, they're loan sharks.

00:22:57.626 --> 00:22:59.587
They ended up giving him a hefty sum
in Myeong-dong.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.339
We have to pay that as well?

00:23:02.423 --> 00:23:05.342
As long as the chairman pulls through
in the end, it won't be an issue.

00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:08.095
They still have interest
coming in every month.

00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:09.597
They shouldn't call it in.

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:15.686
If the chairman dies, then what?

00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:18.856
They'll have to call it in because
you're not the borrower on the account.

00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:21.483
What if I make them more money?

00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:23.527
They trusted the chairman's way
of doing things.

00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:26.071
- To them, you're a risk.
- So how'd he do it?

00:23:26.155 --> 00:23:28.574
Entertainment, mostly.
Lots of booze and hostesses.

00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:31.577
- I can throw parties.
- Are you willing to degrade yourself?

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.287
Absolutely. Why not?

00:23:34.163 --> 00:23:36.206
So bribery, even sex?

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:45.966
You can leave.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.051
Okay.

00:24:01.523 --> 00:24:02.733
YUNSEONG OB-GYN CLINIC

00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:04.234
I have your test results.

00:24:05.736 --> 00:24:08.072
Ma'am, you're pregnant.

00:24:09.198 --> 00:24:11.158
- What?
- They weren't menstrual cramps at all.

00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:13.911
They were implantation cramps.

00:24:14.703 --> 00:24:17.331
These tend to start
after the egg has been fertilized

00:24:17.414 --> 00:24:20.334
and is attaching itself
to the lining of your uterus.

00:24:20.417 --> 00:24:21.627
All very normal.

00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:25.464
You have to be careful
in the early stages of pregnancy.

00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:29.259
The next time you come in,
can you bring the father along with you?

00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:33.430
There are things I'll need to go over,
some precautions.

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:41.188
{\an8}MUAN

00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:42.314
{\an8}

00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:45.859
Oh, son of a bitch. Damn.

00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:48.570
I don't remember the road being like this.

00:24:57.538 --> 00:24:58.539
Uh, we're here.

00:24:58.622 --> 00:24:59.957
All right.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.292
Oh, man.

00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:04.461
Damn it.

00:25:04.545 --> 00:25:08.048
- I never should've offered to sit in back.
- Oh, my back!

00:25:08.132 --> 00:25:10.175
- Is this the shed?
- Yeah.

00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:12.845
My buddy used to store salt here,
but should be empty now.

00:25:12.928 --> 00:25:15.180
- Huh?
- Let's see.

00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:23.647
Man, this place looks haunted.

00:25:24.732 --> 00:25:28.902
Desalination in a salt shack.
Well, if that ain't irony.

00:25:28.986 --> 00:25:31.405
It's not too bad.
Let's get a move on.

00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:32.656
- Yep.
- Yeah, all right.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.242
- Okay.
- This is gonna take all day.

00:25:36.452 --> 00:25:40.247
Doctor. It says here you've
changed Chairman Cheon's prescription.

00:25:40.914 --> 00:25:43.751
Uh-huh, there's no need
to draw it out any longer.

00:25:43.834 --> 00:25:45.878
But I don't think the medication…

00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:50.090
His family told me if he's to die anyway,
they would rather keep him from suffering.

00:25:50.174 --> 00:25:52.176
Aw, that's heartless.

00:25:52.259 --> 00:25:54.636
You shouldn't judge if you haven't
been in their shoes.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.763
I guess.

00:25:57.473 --> 00:25:58.474
Oh.

00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:00.934
Keep this quiet.
We're in trouble if this gets out.

00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:02.436
Yes, sir.

00:26:13.614 --> 00:26:15.699
- Ah, this is hard work.
- Ooh.

00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:17.409
Oh, I'm getting lightheaded.

00:26:17.493 --> 00:26:21.121
All right, we moved 389 pieces to Muan.

00:26:21.205 --> 00:26:23.832
Here, I need your thumbprint.
Hey, you're next.

00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:26.168
- Uh, right. I got it.
- Yeah.

00:26:27.211 --> 00:26:29.171
So how are we contacting
that lady in Seoul?

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:30.923
Well, there's no rush.

00:26:31.006 --> 00:26:32.883
Okay, one for each of you.

00:26:32.966 --> 00:26:33.967
- Here.
- Yeah.

00:26:34.968 --> 00:26:38.472
Look, if the three of us aren't here,
that door stays closed, all right?

00:26:38.555 --> 00:26:40.307
- Damn right.
- Yeah, of course.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.101
Come on, then. Let's get this on.

00:26:42.184 --> 00:26:44.228
- Uh, get what on?
- Cool, right?

00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:45.521
What do you think?

00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:47.106
Will this really make us rich?

00:26:47.648 --> 00:26:52.111
It's worth a lot to some people.
They'll pay a fortune for it.

00:26:52.736 --> 00:26:54.363
Uh, what the f…

00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:57.157
Right, but I mean,
can I buy a house with this?

00:26:58.283 --> 00:26:59.952
Course you could. Whatever you want.

00:27:01.495 --> 00:27:03.080
All right, then, let's go.

00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:05.332
And stop kicking them, punk.

00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:07.626
- So, do they fit?
- Yeah.

00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:09.211
- Yeah, they do.
- Yeah.

00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:11.713
- Yeah.
- They're great.

00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:12.840
- What's this?
- Here.

00:27:20.848 --> 00:27:22.641
Fuck that bitch.

00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:25.185
- Hey, uh, when are you getting paid?
- In six months.

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:28.021
How the hell am I supposed
to run a business like this?

00:27:28.105 --> 00:27:30.065
This isn't good.

00:27:30.732 --> 00:27:33.026
- Hanguk Manufacturing?
- Oh, yeah.

00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:36.446
Ma'am, a six-month delay
will put us in a really tight spot.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:39.199
- Three months will be better.
- No, you know how these things work.

00:27:42.202 --> 00:27:44.913
Here, I heard the chairman's in bad shape.

00:27:44.997 --> 00:27:47.040
Wild ginseng. For him, please.

00:27:47.624 --> 00:27:48.917
It's still six.

00:27:50.252 --> 00:27:51.295
{\an8}ISSUED: MAY 12TH, 1977

00:27:51.378 --> 00:27:53.755
Ma'am,
these are his new medications.

00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:55.966
He should have them three times a day
after a meal.

00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:57.467
You said new medication?

00:27:57.551 --> 00:27:59.636
Yes, it's three-weeks' worth.

00:28:00.262 --> 00:28:02.598
I made sure there would be
no medical complications.

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:05.434
- Can you save him instead?
- What do you mean?

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:06.768
Well, because, if he dies,

00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:09.354
neither of us will get what we want
when it really comes down to it.

00:28:09.438 --> 00:28:10.981
Oh.

00:28:11.064 --> 00:28:15.193
- Okay, I'll see what I can do.
- He should be able to eat.

00:28:16.153 --> 00:28:18.113
But I don't want to give him
the ability to speak.

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:20.657
He should see me but not remember me.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.994
He can hear, but he can't judge me.

00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:25.913
I understand.

00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:29.166
I'll do what needs to be done.

00:28:29.249 --> 00:28:32.920
In that case, however,
I need insurance from you up front.

00:28:34.588 --> 00:28:35.672
Like what?

00:28:35.756 --> 00:28:38.091
We'd benefit from having
a full-body CT scanner.

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:40.719
Only two hospitals
in the country have one.

00:28:40.802 --> 00:28:42.387
Well, that can be arranged.

00:28:42.471 --> 00:28:44.348
We're one billion in debt, why not two?

00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:45.974
- Right?
- That's all I would need.

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:47.100
Then goodbye.

00:28:47.184 --> 00:28:48.185
Yes.

00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:51.647
And in the future,
don't come here regarding this matter.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.856
Understood, Mrs. Yang.

00:29:08.205 --> 00:29:10.791
Uh, we got a call to meet up
in Myeong-dong.

00:29:10.874 --> 00:29:12.376
- Myeong-dong?
- Yes.

00:29:12.459 --> 00:29:14.544
It's the company that gave us the loan.

00:29:15.128 --> 00:29:18.173
The chairman's health scare
must be making them feel a bit nervous.

00:29:20.008 --> 00:29:22.219
If it isn't one thing, it's another…

00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:24.304
Have a good day.

00:29:24.388 --> 00:29:25.389
"BUSAN RESTAURANT"

00:29:25.472 --> 00:29:27.766
- You tired?
- Here's your food.

00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:29.935
- Mmm… Smells delicious.
- Here you are.

00:29:30.018 --> 00:29:31.853
- It's hot. Be careful.
- Oh, thanks.

00:29:31.937 --> 00:29:33.522
Please enjoy.

00:29:34.231 --> 00:29:35.857
If you're finished,
then let's get out of here!

00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:38.527
We've got a shitload of places
we still gotta hit today.

00:29:39.152 --> 00:29:40.445
How many suckers did you scam,

00:29:40.529 --> 00:29:43.865
because I'm getting sick and tired
of following your ass all over the place.

00:29:43.949 --> 00:29:46.451
Let me just have a smoke.
I gotta catch my breath.

00:29:46.535 --> 00:29:49.287
You got to stuff your belly and now
you're chilling outside with a smoke.

00:29:49.371 --> 00:29:50.622
Living the good life, huh?

00:29:50.706 --> 00:29:52.332
You think that's what this is?

00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:53.709
What do you mean?

00:29:54.376 --> 00:29:57.879
That treasure trove of money
I left there, huh?

00:29:57.963 --> 00:30:00.966
I mean just sitting here thinking about it
is driving me nuts.

00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:03.969
What are you on about?
You got some cash squirreled away?

00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:08.432
The Sinan pottery. The ocean is
stacked high with piles of riches.

00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:11.435
- Those are shitty fakes, though.
- What the hell are you talking about?

00:30:11.518 --> 00:30:15.022
That's Yuan Dynasty shit right there.
A treasure trove, like I said.

00:30:15.105 --> 00:30:17.441
Can't believe I'm stuck here
with you assholes.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:21.570
You really think that so many guys
would be working their asses off

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:22.946
digging up fakes?

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.365
Come on.

00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:30.328
Tell me what's going on
with this pottery, explain it to me.

00:30:32.748 --> 00:30:33.749
All right listen,

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:38.003
the government sent divers down there
and they got around two thousand pieces.

00:30:38.628 --> 00:30:42.174
Turns out they're worth billions
on the market.

00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:44.217
- With a B?
- Damn right.

00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:48.472
While the government's been gone
we've been looting for a little while.

00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:50.640
There's this lady over in Seoul.

00:30:50.724 --> 00:30:54.478
She said she'd buy the whole haul,
but that's only if I'm in on the deal.

00:30:55.062 --> 00:30:57.481
But here I am with you assholes.

00:30:57.564 --> 00:31:00.859
You're just doing those jerks a favor
by letting them take my cut.

00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:02.903
What kinda bullshit is that?

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.114
Is there a lot to dig up still?

00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:08.909
Right before you took me,
things were just getting started.

00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:12.954
The divers were going on and on
about how the sunken ship was loaded.

00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:16.291
Huh… How many you got so far?

00:31:17.084 --> 00:31:19.252
Let's see, I think around 500.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.882
Man, that kind of haul?
Just think about how much that's worth.

00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:25.509
Should we jack the whole damn thing?

00:31:32.265 --> 00:31:33.683
Billions?

00:32:02.379 --> 00:32:05.382
Oh, Mrs. Yang.
There you are!

00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:09.261
- What are you fussing about now?
- It's Chairman Cheon! The chairman is…

00:32:10.011 --> 00:32:11.138
Oh, is he dead?

00:32:11.221 --> 00:32:12.347
He's awake and eating.

00:32:19.229 --> 00:32:20.897
It's been over an hour already.

00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:37.289
Seokbae, how many have you got in there?

00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:38.957
Let's see.

00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:42.169
There's 74 here. What you got?

00:32:42.252 --> 00:32:44.004
We've got 56 over here.

00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:45.589
Geez, I'm exhausted.

00:32:45.672 --> 00:32:47.174
- I know.
- I'm aching.

00:32:47.257 --> 00:32:49.843
- Diving with no rest, over and over!
- Oh, stop aching.

00:32:49.926 --> 00:32:52.387
Ugh. On top of that,
they haven't paid us yet!

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.264
Hey, man. They haven't paid us yet either.

00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:56.391
Wait, you've been working for free, too?

00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:58.435
Look, we'll get paid
once everything's been dug out.

00:32:58.518 --> 00:33:00.270
Why do you believe that weasel from Seoul?

00:33:00.353 --> 00:33:03.398
How many times have we worked together
before, man? Trust me on this.

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:06.234
Hey, man, this ain't
how it's supposed to go.

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:09.279
You let them take advantage!
They're working us like slaves,

00:33:09.362 --> 00:33:10.864
- without any pay.
- He's right.

00:33:10.947 --> 00:33:13.950
They need to start giving us
some money now. This is BS.

00:33:14.034 --> 00:33:15.202
You know what, that's right!

00:33:15.285 --> 00:33:17.287
I'm done with this! I'm done, I quit!

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.206
- Hey. Quit doing that.
- Come on. Let's go.

00:33:19.289 --> 00:33:22.042
- Screw it. Getting outta here.
- I can't do this.

00:33:26.963 --> 00:33:29.299
Will ya look at that, I'm impressed.

00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:33.053
Even in a Podunk town like this
you're still keeping neat? Man.

00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:35.722
- Discipline.
- Nah, it's just a habit.

00:33:35.805 --> 00:33:38.892
It's more than that.
Nobody else is keeping tidy out at sea.

00:33:38.975 --> 00:33:41.728
Even here you're the only one
who cares about that shit.

00:33:44.564 --> 00:33:46.024
What do you think, delicious right?

00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:49.986
- Chew it slowly.
- I don't even need to chew it.

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:51.404
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.

00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:54.824
Gwanseok.

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:57.035
Yeah.

00:33:58.495 --> 00:34:01.873
I brought them over.
The 300 pieces that I farmed.

00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:05.210
- How'd you get them here?
- I used a truck, of course.

00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:07.420
I was a truck driver
in the army, you know?

00:34:08.338 --> 00:34:09.464
And the cash?

00:34:12.926 --> 00:34:15.428
At first when the rich folk
heard "Sinan pottery,"

00:34:15.512 --> 00:34:17.222
they seemed very interested.

00:34:17.305 --> 00:34:20.267
But they wouldn't pay until they saw it
with their own eyes.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:23.436
Look at you…
All that talk and you didn't bring shit.

00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:27.649
Hey, what about the money you got
from the chairman's wife?

00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:29.401
That ran out a long time ago.

00:34:29.484 --> 00:34:30.610
We've got a ton of expenses.

00:34:30.694 --> 00:34:33.196
I mean, we had to get a barge
and everything.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.031
We're bleeding cash left and right.

00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:37.575
Hey, Seokbae.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:39.536
What're you doing back so early?

00:34:41.621 --> 00:34:43.248
The mood is awful out there.

00:34:43.873 --> 00:34:46.084
They're pissed that you're not
paying them anything.

00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:47.711
They're all gonna quit
if something doesn't change.

00:34:48.336 --> 00:34:51.172
They need something. You gotta start
paying 'em what you promised.

00:34:51.256 --> 00:34:53.383
Okay, still, you shouldn't be
coming back before dark!

00:34:53.466 --> 00:34:55.468
Then you talk to them
and figure this shit out.

00:34:55.552 --> 00:34:57.762
I'm telling you,
they're about to blow out there.

00:34:58.513 --> 00:34:59.556
You saw it, Bokgeun.

00:35:01.975 --> 00:35:04.477
Fucking idiot,
what're you staying quiet for?

00:35:04.561 --> 00:35:07.397
- Just grill the meat.
- Yeah, I know.

00:35:07.981 --> 00:35:09.899
So, how much you got?

00:35:12.402 --> 00:35:14.362
Look, you've got to
pay the divers something.

00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:15.655
Things'll get ugly.

00:35:20.201 --> 00:35:21.578
Hey, can we talk?

00:35:22.162 --> 00:35:23.288
Why?

00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:26.666
Hang this to dry.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.252
- Daesik, come here.
- Ugh, shit.

00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:33.757
The hell's wrong with you, man?

00:35:36.885 --> 00:35:37.886
What's going on?

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.563
Hey.

00:35:48.647 --> 00:35:50.398
When's the government
starting the salvage?

00:35:50.482 --> 00:35:52.525
Next week.

00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:54.611
For fuck's sake. Shit.

00:35:54.694 --> 00:35:56.821
Look, just let me outta here
and I can try and…

00:35:56.905 --> 00:35:59.282
I'll see what I can do
about buying some time for you.

00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:00.617
How's that?

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.994
The station will be
the first place they hit.

00:36:03.078 --> 00:36:04.537
I'll take them out for a few drinks

00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:06.665
and some nice ladies
they can fool around with.

00:36:06.748 --> 00:36:09.501
- That'll hold them off for a day or two.
- How can we trust you?

00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:10.835
Fuck it, whatever then.

00:36:10.919 --> 00:36:13.421
I know they're gonna come looking
for me either way.

00:36:13.505 --> 00:36:17.550
Man, if the whole squad were to
show up and find you here,

00:36:17.634 --> 00:36:18.885
you guys would be screwed.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:29.854
Cut him loose.

00:36:29.938 --> 00:36:31.523
No way, he'll turn us in.

00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:33.733
We have to trust that he won't.
They're coming in a week.

00:36:33.817 --> 00:36:35.735
You think he's just gonna
forget all this shit?

00:36:35.819 --> 00:36:37.696
What's going on?

00:36:42.784 --> 00:36:45.995
The government's sending a team
next week, to do salvage.

00:36:47.706 --> 00:36:49.582
Honggi, no bullshit?

00:36:49.666 --> 00:36:50.667
I'm telling you.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.377
I got a notice. Do you wanna see it?

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:55.630
Hey, before things get any worse,

00:36:56.214 --> 00:36:58.007
- go and cut him loose.
- I can't do that.

00:36:58.091 --> 00:37:00.051
We're keeping him here
until the job is done.

00:37:00.135 --> 00:37:01.428
Then what?

00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:03.596
Because the crew's gonna quit
if they don't get paid

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.640
and we're out of cash. It's now or never.

00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:08.059
What do you want to do?
You wanna walk away?

00:37:10.603 --> 00:37:13.398
Look, Heedong.
You and I should go to Seoul.

00:37:13.481 --> 00:37:15.608
We'll get the money
from the Chairman's wife.

00:37:15.692 --> 00:37:17.569
We gotta act fast. Okay?

00:37:17.652 --> 00:37:20.280
Everyday we're not diving,
we're leaving money on the table.

00:37:20.363 --> 00:37:22.574
Then let's just get the money.
Come on, Uncle. Why let him go?

00:37:22.657 --> 00:37:25.702
- Do you really trust him?
- Oh, come on, come on, come on!

00:37:25.785 --> 00:37:26.828
Just believe me!

00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:29.748
Look, things are gonna get complicated
if I end up dead, all right?

00:37:29.831 --> 00:37:31.708
I'm a cop, remember?

00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:34.169
And I took your money.
I'm not clean here either.

00:37:36.588 --> 00:37:40.633
I'm one of you now, so I gotta do
what's best for all of us.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.929
Come on, let's go! I'll help you all.

00:37:46.055 --> 00:37:48.475
Look, I'll say it again.
I'm in it to the end.

00:37:49.893 --> 00:37:51.227
Well?

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:14.918
Let's go. Now or never.

00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:16.294
- Yeah.
- We'll be stuck here

00:38:16.377 --> 00:38:18.630
- if the tide goes out. Let's move it.
- I heard you.

00:38:37.607 --> 00:38:38.608
{\an8}CHAIRMAN CHEON HWANGSIK

00:38:46.199 --> 00:38:47.492
Chairman Cheon.

00:38:48.618 --> 00:38:51.246
Welcome back, sir.
I'm so glad you're okay.

00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:53.122
Good to see you, sir.

00:38:53.206 --> 00:38:54.499
We missed you very much.

00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:00.463
{\an8}

00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:07.095
{\an8}How are you doing?

00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:08.930
Things aren't great here, sir.

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.974
The two of us were just waiting
for you to come back.

00:39:11.057 --> 00:39:13.351
We needed your leadership.

00:39:13.434 --> 00:39:15.603
Chairman, is it true?
Are you really back then, sir?

00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:18.189
{\an8}Why? Were you wishing I'd be out longer?

00:39:18.273 --> 00:39:21.192
No, uh, we're just glad
that you're doing well.

00:39:21.276 --> 00:39:22.485
{\an8}You're glad?

00:39:22.569 --> 00:39:25.488
{\an8}Sir, honestly,
we're in a bad position now.

00:39:25.572 --> 00:39:28.700
{\an8}Shortly after you collapsed,
many of us were let go.

00:39:28.783 --> 00:39:31.703
It was for no apparent reason. And--

00:39:31.786 --> 00:39:33.621
Think it's unfair, do you?

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.416
You bunch of rat bastards.

00:39:36.499 --> 00:39:37.625
Damn it.

00:39:37.709 --> 00:39:39.377
Oh, sweetie, no.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.963
Calm down now. Calm down.
Can you give him something?

00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:43.172
I know your angle here.

00:39:43.256 --> 00:39:46.885
{\an8}You thought all of this would be
yours for the taking when I died.

00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:49.637
That's why you got me
drinking like that all night, isn't it?

00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:51.556
Oh, I bet you were happy I fell.

00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:53.975
No, chairman…
you've misunderstood…

00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:57.520
{\an8}Quiet! I already know
what you traitors were plotting all along.

00:39:57.604 --> 00:39:58.605
{\an8}

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:05.028
{\an8}Everything is logged right here!
It's written down plain as day.

00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:07.405
- Um, no, Hwangsik, that's not what--
- No!

00:40:07.488 --> 00:40:08.781
No!

00:40:08.865 --> 00:40:12.911
If she hadn't stepped in…
you better believe you would be in prison.

00:40:12.994 --> 00:40:14.454
{\an8}You should thank her right now!

00:40:18.625 --> 00:40:20.126
Get out of my sight!

00:40:27.508 --> 00:40:30.470
I don't think I've ever seen
something like this.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.847
At least the fire has been put out.

00:40:32.931 --> 00:40:34.557
I guess it's better this way.

00:40:34.641 --> 00:40:37.727
Looks like he's doing fine.
The worst is behind us.

00:40:38.227 --> 00:40:40.271
As it stands, that's how it looks.

00:40:40.355 --> 00:40:41.856
Oh, and ma'am.

00:40:44.025 --> 00:40:47.904
This is the estimate I mentioned.
The one for the CT scanner.

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:54.619
You're impatient.

00:40:55.912 --> 00:40:56.996
Well, then…

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.291
Wait a minute.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.548
Those drugs you gave me. You said
they were medically safe, right?

00:41:09.092 --> 00:41:10.218
What do you…

00:41:10.802 --> 00:41:13.763
Oh, please. Do you need me
to spell it out for you?

00:41:14.847 --> 00:41:15.848
Ah.

00:41:16.557 --> 00:41:19.686
Right. There won't be any problems.

00:41:20.269 --> 00:41:22.397
Let's just say
the authorities take a look.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.065
They won't find anything strange?

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:27.777
No. I mean, the medication is standard.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.821
It's just bad for him specifically.

00:41:31.114 --> 00:41:32.240
All right, that'll be all.

00:41:52.552 --> 00:41:53.553
Sweetheart.

00:41:56.472 --> 00:41:57.807
Honey, listen.

00:41:58.516 --> 00:42:01.394
Okay so, I can tell you
what happened.

00:42:05.732 --> 00:42:07.316
What'd you do with the records?

00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:12.238
Thing is, Assemblyman Kim
needed money quickly, so…

00:42:13.156 --> 00:42:15.241
You were just lying there, out of it.

00:42:15.324 --> 00:42:18.703
And that's when all the loan sharks
and the banks started coming after me.

00:42:18.786 --> 00:42:21.164
- I had to get cash right away.
- Don't tell me.

00:42:22.957 --> 00:42:24.709
You withdrew that money?

00:42:25.585 --> 00:42:26.586
Yes.

00:42:27.837 --> 00:42:30.673
I still have it, of course.
It's somewhere safe.

00:42:31.299 --> 00:42:33.134
You will return all of it.

00:42:33.801 --> 00:42:34.802
Yes, but…

00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:38.931
This Sinan undertaking of ours
is costing quite a lot.

00:42:39.015 --> 00:42:41.100
I really think we'll get
a good return though.

00:42:41.184 --> 00:42:42.435
It's much bigger than we thought it was.

00:42:42.518 --> 00:42:44.520
- I'll take care of every--
- Uh!

00:42:49.567 --> 00:42:51.694
I won't repeat this…

00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:55.823
Just go and get it back.

00:42:55.907 --> 00:42:56.908
Mm-hmm?

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:02.413
Okay.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.169
All righty, I spoke to the villagers.

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:10.713
Just come back with the money.
They'll work while you're gone.

00:43:10.797 --> 00:43:12.256
Don't worry and go.

00:43:13.091 --> 00:43:14.133
I'm counting on you.

00:43:15.843 --> 00:43:16.844
Honggi.

00:43:18.179 --> 00:43:21.182
You and me,
we got no hard feelings, right?

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:23.142
I'm good, don't worry about it.

00:43:23.726 --> 00:43:25.895
If you can, keep us aware.

00:43:26.813 --> 00:43:27.897
I can't make it obvious,

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.399
but when they come,
I'll call you right away.

00:43:30.483 --> 00:43:32.860
Have one of your guys waiting
by the phone to be safe.

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:35.113
You hear that?

00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:37.782
Yeah. See you later.

00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:43.955
You said you fought with Beolgu.
Was that bullshit?

00:43:44.997 --> 00:43:45.998
Why?

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.169
The back of his skull was all busted so…

00:43:51.796 --> 00:43:52.880
Just wondering.

00:43:55.383 --> 00:43:56.843
- You fucking-- shit!
- Hey.

00:43:58.344 --> 00:44:00.096
- It's all right. Go. Go.
- Shit.

00:44:04.433 --> 00:44:05.977
I knew we shouldn't have let him loose.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.691
Are you wanting money
for that girlfriend of yours?

00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:15.653
What are you even gonna do
with that hillbilly?

00:44:15.736 --> 00:44:18.322
Once you make money,
you won't even look twice at her.

00:44:18.406 --> 00:44:20.908
- Stay out of it, I got this.
- Oh, you got this?

00:44:20.992 --> 00:44:24.745
She lied to you to get to Seoul,
you know that? She was never pregnant.

00:44:25.246 --> 00:44:26.455
Yeah, I already know!

00:44:28.958 --> 00:44:30.293
Are you in love with her?

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:35.423
You idiot, you gotta be
fucking kidding me!

00:44:35.506 --> 00:44:37.550
Open your damn eyes, kid.

00:44:37.633 --> 00:44:41.220
- Don't you know how dirty these girls are?
- What if I don't give a fuck?

00:44:41.721 --> 00:44:43.389
You think we're any cleaner?

00:44:52.857 --> 00:44:54.567
That damn idiot kid.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:56.110
Welcome home, Mrs. Yang.

00:44:56.194 --> 00:44:57.195
Hi.

00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:58.905
Is he home?

00:44:58.988 --> 00:45:01.782
The chairman? He went to bed
as soon as he got in.

00:45:02.283 --> 00:45:03.910
I guess he's not feeling any better.

00:45:05.328 --> 00:45:06.537
He went straight to bed?

00:45:07.246 --> 00:45:08.581
Yes.

00:45:44.659 --> 00:45:47.245
Time to wake up, dear. Wake up honey.

00:45:47.328 --> 00:45:49.205
You need to take your medicine.

00:45:49.288 --> 00:45:53.042
I… I took my meds already.

00:45:53.125 --> 00:45:55.336
Dr. Kim gave you
a new prescription earlier.

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:58.798
Take it now.

00:46:03.886 --> 00:46:04.887
Take your time, dear.

00:46:14.397 --> 00:46:17.942
Ugh. God, that tastes awful.

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:20.027
Anything good for you usually does.

00:46:20.111 --> 00:46:23.114
Once you're better,
the company can get back on track.

00:46:34.542 --> 00:46:35.543
Ugh.

00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:40.548
Did you return the money?

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:43.301
Don't worry, I'll do it, dear. Tomorrow.

00:46:43.884 --> 00:46:45.469
No reason to get upset.

00:46:45.553 --> 00:46:47.263
No, I understand.

00:46:47.346 --> 00:46:50.182
I'm the one at fault.
I should've asked you first.

00:46:50.266 --> 00:46:53.102
Well, how's the digging coming?

00:46:53.728 --> 00:46:56.230
- I told them that we'd take everything.
- Okay.

00:46:56.314 --> 00:46:58.149
I'll set aside good ones
for the assemblyman.

00:46:58.232 --> 00:46:59.275
All right.

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:01.235
You did great there.

00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:05.448
- All right. Tomorrow's a busy day.
- Yeah.

00:47:20.379 --> 00:47:21.797
It's okay, I'll get it.

00:47:21.881 --> 00:47:22.882
Sure.

00:47:27.303 --> 00:47:29.597
- Yes, hello?
- Uh, hello, ma'am.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.432
This is, uh, Oh Gwanseok.

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:33.559
I'm in Seoul right now for a little bit.

00:47:33.642 --> 00:47:35.227
What brings you all the way back to Seoul?

00:47:35.311 --> 00:47:39.231
We heard the government's about to start
a salvage operation in our area real soon.

00:47:39.315 --> 00:47:41.108
We hired some folks from the village.

00:47:41.192 --> 00:47:43.444
But we're out of cash,
and we need your help, ma'am.

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:45.446
So you need money now, is that right?

00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:49.116
Things haven't been
going smoothly here either.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.118
Um… Is everything all right?

00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:52.953
The chairman's not doing well.

00:47:53.621 --> 00:47:55.664
It's a little hard for me
to care about the pottery.

00:47:55.748 --> 00:47:58.793
Um. Uh, sorry to hear that.

00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:00.753
Why don't we talk face-to-face, then?

00:48:00.836 --> 00:48:03.547
How's two o'clock at the Myeongdong
Hotel? There's a café there.

00:48:03.631 --> 00:48:04.840
See you then, ma'am.

00:48:07.259 --> 00:48:09.178
Shit.

00:48:09.261 --> 00:48:10.429
What is it?

00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:13.516
I guess Cheon's pretty sick.

00:48:14.308 --> 00:48:16.143
We're seeing her tomorrow at two o'clock.

00:48:16.977 --> 00:48:17.978
Sure.

00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.690
Let's go home, yeah?

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:24.318
I can't now.

00:48:25.778 --> 00:48:29.073
Anyway, think it's okay
we left the boys in Jeungdo alone?

00:48:29.156 --> 00:48:30.199
Yeah, why?

00:48:30.282 --> 00:48:32.368
Like, they could screw us
while we're here.

00:48:32.451 --> 00:48:34.870
Nah, that's nothing to worry about.

00:48:35.538 --> 00:48:37.373
I think they'll be
keeping an eye on each other.

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:41.585
You go ahead. I'm just gonna make a call.

00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:45.798
Don't show up late and hungover.

00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:47.383
- See you then.
- Yeah.

00:48:55.182 --> 00:48:56.600
Hey, Uncle.

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:58.602
Yeah?

00:48:59.395 --> 00:49:02.189
Say hi to Auntie for me. And the kids.

00:49:03.399 --> 00:49:04.525
All right.

00:49:33.596 --> 00:49:38.642
MARILYN BOUTIQUE

00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:50.529
- Where is he?
- Hey.

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.415
Why are you here at this hour?

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:07.505
I was hoping to borrow a little cash.

00:50:10.174 --> 00:50:12.510
You and everyone else.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:15.804
How much money do you need?

00:50:18.057 --> 00:50:20.017
A million won.

00:50:21.143 --> 00:50:23.395
Please don't ask why. I-I promise that I--

00:50:23.479 --> 00:50:24.730
I'll make sure you get it back.

00:51:01.225 --> 00:51:04.562
Don't worry about it.
I'm just giving it to you.

00:51:05.062 --> 00:51:06.855
Uh, why?

00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:09.567
- You got a problem with that?
- Uh.

00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:14.530
I'll return it as soon as I can.
I appreciate it.

00:51:14.613 --> 00:51:16.031
Wait a minute.

00:51:26.542 --> 00:51:27.793
This is all I want.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.337
Don't worry about returning it.

00:51:30.838 --> 00:51:32.548
Is everything okay?

00:51:35.884 --> 00:51:38.637
It's fine. You can go.

00:52:12.338 --> 00:52:13.589
Huh?

00:52:29.521 --> 00:52:31.482
The hell is g… what?

00:52:36.403 --> 00:52:39.990
You don't think Gwanseok would
screw us over, right?

00:52:40.074 --> 00:52:41.075
What are you saying?

00:52:41.659 --> 00:52:42.660
In Muan.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.579
Everything's in that shed.
What if he takes off with it?

00:52:45.663 --> 00:52:46.872
Hey.

00:52:47.539 --> 00:52:49.124
I got the key right here.

00:52:50.042 --> 00:52:53.045
Are you serious? He could just use
a hammer to bust it open, you know.

00:52:53.128 --> 00:52:54.254
That's true.

00:52:54.963 --> 00:52:57.675
Wait, do you think it's okay
for us to just sit here?

00:52:57.758 --> 00:52:58.884
Shouldn't we go check it out?

00:52:58.967 --> 00:53:00.636
You're not going anywhere.

00:53:00.719 --> 00:53:02.346
No one's going anywhere
until he gets back.

00:53:03.138 --> 00:53:04.682
You kidding me?

00:53:04.765 --> 00:53:08.102
I gotta go home and take care of my kid.
I can't just sit here all night.

00:53:08.185 --> 00:53:10.979
We're running out of time to dig up
everything we can out there!

00:53:11.063 --> 00:53:12.564
But you're sitting here,
crying like babies.

00:53:12.648 --> 00:53:14.316
Crying? I'm not crying.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.568
Who the hell you think you are,
telling us what do?

00:53:16.652 --> 00:53:17.695
- Hey, now.
- What was that?

00:53:17.778 --> 00:53:18.779
That's enough.

00:53:20.823 --> 00:53:21.824
- What the hell?
- What?

00:53:21.907 --> 00:53:23.492
- Daesik. Daesik.
- What is it?

00:53:23.575 --> 00:53:24.868
Shit.

00:53:32.751 --> 00:53:35.003
How you doing tonight, fellas?

00:53:41.635 --> 00:53:43.637
{\an8}
