WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.880
Yang Zong

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:52.400
Detective Yang

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.800
It will not open

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.360
Detective Yang

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.800
Are you in there

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:00.639
This one will not open either

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.840
Detective Yang

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.000
Y you wait a moment

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:09.960
Do not move

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.000
Do not panic

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:29.639
The body was switched

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.480
I know

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:31.679
The killer is A Wen

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.199
Hurry they are about to leave town

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:36.800
Uncle Chen

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.239
I have not said goodbye to Master yet

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.039
There is no time

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.079
Where there is life

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.199
There is hope

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:43.159
Do not waste your dads painstaking efforts

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.400
Stop

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:55.239
Man Tun turn around

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.079
Why is he here

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:58.880
Was he not in the cabinet

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.840
Stop

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:02.280
Stop

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.639
Do not move

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:07.480
Come any closer and I will kill myself

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:08.559
So you dead men tell no tales

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.360
A Wen

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:10.400
Do not do anything stupid

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.880
A Wen put the carving knife down first

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.320
You are a craftsman

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.519
How can you let your tools be stained with blood

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.679
Can you face Master Wu if you do this

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:20.679
You will not get away

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.119
Come back to the station with me now

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.599
Fight for lenient treatment

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.440
If you flee from justice the penalty will be harsher

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.360
Explain everything clearly

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.760
Only then can Xiang Zi have a way out

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.719
On the twentieth

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.480
It was supposed to be the happiest day of my life

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.000
These are the tools your Master

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.519
passed down to you for cork painting

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.920
Yes

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.360
This is the legacy of the Wu lineage

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:54.800
This ancestral carving knife

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.840
can shrink landscapes into a tiny frame

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.039
so towering peaks over tens of thousands of li

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.400
are all contained in one frame

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.840
Starting today

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.760
it is passed to your generation

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:08.199
Thank you Master

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.400
Dad

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:11.800
Master passed the carving knife to me today too

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.719
Really

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:15.400
A Wen

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:17.079
Since Master values you so much

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.800
you must study hard

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.960
Do not worry Dad

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.159
I will definitely study hard

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.280
and make our family proud

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.280
Your mom in the afterlife will be happy too

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.360
Good child

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.920
A Wen

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:30.039
Go back to your room first

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.519
Dad is going out for a bit

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:35.320
Dad

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.840
What is wrong

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.239
I am going to see Boss Qin

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:41.440
Did Boss Qin dock all your wages again

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.880
I scraped the rickshaw while driving

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.639
It is right to pay some money

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.519
He is clearly just nitpicking

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.440
It is normal to bump the rickshaw sometimes

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.920
How can he be so mean

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.920
Dad

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.119
You need to stand tall

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.760
You cannot let him bully you anymore

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.440
All right all right

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.039
Dad will go buy some drinks and food

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.760
We father and son will celebrate properly

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:03.239
Okay go back go back

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.000
Okay

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.039
Boss Qin

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.360
I am here to apologize to you

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.519
About that rickshaw

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.039
I really did not damage it on purpose

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.599
I am willing to repay you with my wages

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.039
Boss Qin

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.039
Wages

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:28.920
Wages

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.239
What wages

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.400
You broke my rickshaw

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:33.840
and still dare to ask me for wages

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.039
Boss Qin

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.239
Y you could at least

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.320
give me a little pay

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.760
I still have to support my son

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.519
Next month we will have nothing to eat at home

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:43.079
Boss Qin

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.079
What does your son have to do with me

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:47.639
You are just a poor dog filthy all over

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.519
It is because I got too close

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:50.280
to you poor dogs

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.760
that my luck has been so bad

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.400
I lost sixty dollars today

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.400
Boss Qin

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.559
How about this

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:58.760
Y you give me next months wages

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.960
Let me advance a bit please

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.920
Just a tiny advance I

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.559
Poor dog can you not understand human words

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.360
The wages belong to my dad

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:08.360
On what grounds do you refuse

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:09.960
Hey brat you have grown bold

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:11.159
to talk to me like that

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.119
Why would I not dare

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:12.719
A Wen

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.239
I do not believe there is no justice in this world

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.039
If you do not pay my dad I will sue you

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:17.360
and let the law uphold justice

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:18.039
You

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.239
You damned brat you must have a death wish

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:24.440
Boss Qin Boss Qin

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:25.159
Boss Qin I

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:25.920
I do not want the wages anymore

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.480
Get out of my way

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.320
Dad Dad

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:30.000
I will kill you

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.559
You little brat

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:37.679
Brat you want to kill me

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.719
I

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.000
A Wen

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:41.199
A Wen

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:49.159
Qin Qin, Boss Qin

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:53.880
Dad

00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:55.960
Hurry

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.119
Get out of here, quick

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.679
Go, now

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.239
Okay, okay, I will go first

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:01.639
So you are saying

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:03.800
that in a panic

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:05.320
you accidentally killed Boss Qin

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.760
Yes

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.079
He was very strong

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.039
It was like he was going to strangle me to death

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:11.840
I had no choice

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:15.760
Then how did Heipi A-Si get involved

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.039
What happened after that

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.960
I am not sure either

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.920
The next night my dad came back and told me

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.000
he had taken care of everything

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.679
and that none of it was my concern anymore

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.400
And how did you all get dragged into this case

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.039
On the night of the twenty first

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.679
Man Tun and I finished our last fare

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:38.880
and were about to take a shortcut back to the depot

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.239
when we suddenly ran into

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.960
Xiang Zi moving Boss Qin's corpse

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.320
We had pulled rickshaws with Xiang Zi for years

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:48.519
we were like real brothers

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.320
He had thought about it all day and night

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:52.280
and still could not figure out

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:54.679
how to move Boss Qin's body

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.079
We already hated Boss Qin

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.159
he always cheated us out of our hard earned wages

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.039
But among the younger ones A Wen

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:03.599
was the most promising child

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:04.840
None of us could bear

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.480
to just watch him go to prison

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:08.119
Brother Xiang Zi, Brother Xiang Zi

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.440
Xiang Zi

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.960
We could throw the body in the river

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.639
and make it look like an accidental drowning

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.000
No

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.159
He has knife wounds on his chest

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.519
The police would find out right away

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.079
Ma Wangye, help us

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.079
Show us a way out

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.440
I will show you a way out

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.960
Cut the body up

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.199
and toss it in all directions

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.199
No one will know whose body it is

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.679
then they cannot trace it back to A Wen as the killer

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:39.760
A-Si

00:07:40.679 --> 00:07:41.400
What do you want

00:07:41.679 --> 00:07:43.199
Boss Qin owed me money and would not pay

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.960
Your son killed him

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:46.800
Now I have no way to get my money back

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:48.519
So how about you pay it back for him

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.480
Not much, just one hundred silver dollars

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.840
A-Si, I beg you

00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:54.239
The three of us together

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.559
cannot scrape together even one dollar, have mercy

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:57.320
You cannot

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.920
Then I will go to the police right now

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.679
and send your precious son to prison

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.599
You

00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:08.400
Brother Xiang Zi

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.840
What do we do now

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:10.719
Th this

00:08:11.239 --> 00:08:11.800
Xiang Zi

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.519
That is two lives, Xiang Zi

00:08:13.719 --> 00:08:14.440
Xiang Zi

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.519
What are we going to do

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.560
This

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.880
I have an idea

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.920
They are about the same build

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.239
I will smash both of their faces

00:08:29.359 --> 00:08:30.439
so the police cannot recognize them

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.800
then switch their bodies

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.079
On Boss Qin

00:08:33.199 --> 00:08:35.079
tattoo Heipi A-Si's tiger head tattoo

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.319
Then, following Heipi A-Si's idea

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:38.239
we dismember him

00:08:38.359 --> 00:08:39.640
and throw the parts all around

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.880
Then we put Heipi A-Si

00:08:41.079 --> 00:08:42.359
in Boss Qin's clothes

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.119
and place him inside the Ma Wangye wood carving

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.119
No one will know

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:46.359
no one will see through it

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:47.960
Even if they see it

00:08:48.239 --> 00:08:49.960
they will not think our A Wen did it

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:51.880
because the time of the crime does not match

00:08:54.319 --> 00:08:55.159
Early that morning

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:56.640
he had already explained

00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:58.640
If we could keep it hidden

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.319
all four of us would be fine

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:02.600
If we could not

00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:05.520
he would shoulder all the crimes

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.520
and not drag any of us down

00:09:11.359 --> 00:09:13.000
My dad did everything for me

00:09:13.359 --> 00:09:14.720
He swallowed his anger with Boss Qin

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.800
also for my sake

00:09:16.199 --> 00:09:17.439
He tried every possible way

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.199
just to help me escape conviction

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.279
But

00:09:21.119 --> 00:09:22.720
I cannot escape my conscience

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.800
After that day

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.560
Do not kill me

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.319
I did not mean to

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.640
I did not mean to

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.560
Do not, do not kill me

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.720
A Wen, A Wen

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.560
A Wen

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:33.079
Dad, Dad

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.159
Boss Qin's ghost came for me

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.399
He came for me

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.000
He wants my life in return

00:09:38.239 --> 00:09:39.800
Alright, it is okay, it is okay

00:09:40.319 --> 00:09:41.880
Even if Boss Qin comes, he will come for Dad

00:09:42.119 --> 00:09:43.079
You will be fine

00:09:43.479 --> 00:09:44.640
Go to sleep, go to sleep

00:09:45.439 --> 00:09:47.199
My dad burned paper money and cut his nails

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.880
not for himself

00:09:49.239 --> 00:09:50.520
all just to ease my mind

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.760
Then your wrist

00:09:54.119 --> 00:09:55.159
how did it get hurt

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.560
I could not bear the torment inside

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.960
and tried to kill myself

00:10:01.479 --> 00:10:03.319
Uncle Chen and the others found me in time

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.800
and saved my life

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.800
I have failed everyone

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:08.399
especially Master

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.199
I am willing to confess and accept punishment

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.720
but I hope

00:10:14.199 --> 00:10:15.560
to see Master one more time

00:10:16.439 --> 00:10:18.319
I want to kneel before him and admit my wrongs

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.800
A Wen has wronged Master

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.880
and failed his guidance and care

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.199
I have brought shame on the Wu School of Cork Painting

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.359
Please expel me from the Wu School

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.039
I will have no complaints

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.960
There is no greater good than correcting mistakes

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.600
There is no greater good than that

00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:38.000
Come back after you have paid for your crimes

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.319
Master

00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:43.920
will always be your Master

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:52.640
Dad

00:10:55.479 --> 00:10:56.239
A Wen

00:10:56.319 --> 00:10:57.560
A Wen, I am sorry, Dad

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.000
A Wen admits his fault to you

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:03.520
A Wen

00:11:06.119 --> 00:11:07.479
A Wen, Dad

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.039
Dad is useless

00:11:09.239 --> 00:11:10.000
Dad

00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:12.439
Dad is the one who ruined you

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.840
Dad, it is A Wen who wronged you

00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:52.399
What a pity for such a cork painting genius

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.479
He will have to spend his time in prison

00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:57.239
The law is the law

00:11:58.319 --> 00:11:59.880
If you kill someone, you must take responsibility

00:12:01.039 --> 00:12:02.800
Everyone must for their own actions

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.319
pay the price

00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:06.399
I contacted a lawyer

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.720
to defend him as justifiable defense

00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:10.159
I hope

00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:11.359
he can get a lighter sentence

00:12:25.439 --> 00:12:27.640
Ma Wangye's back has been tampered with

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.399
Two kinds of wood are joined together

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.960
Ordinary people cannot see any difference at all

00:12:33.239 --> 00:12:35.439
This is what Lu Ban's Secret Art calls

00:12:35.479 --> 00:12:36.960
the Art of Grafting

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:41.000
Could it be him again

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.560
Mu Dun, huh

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.680
The case is solved, why can you not rest

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.119
Go to sleep

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.000
The Wood Carving Corpse Case

00:12:50.119 --> 00:12:51.680
It definitely was not done by one person

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.000
A rickshaw puller

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.439
How could he possibly know so much

00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:58.840
Behind these cases

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:01.760
there must be someone else
