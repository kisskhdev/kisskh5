Come here, darling.

57
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,540
Good girl.

58
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,220
Is that medicine for your mother?

59
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,660
- She fell asleep after lunch. - Good girl.

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,410
Is that so?

61
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,980
He's not Zhang Tie.

62
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,690
Who is he?

63
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,130
You're certainly good at playing the part.

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,730
Who are you?

That's my question.

67
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,010
I don't understand what you're saying.

68
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:51,890
Is that so?

69
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,380
You've taken someone else's body.

70
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,850
That woman and child

71
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,010
aren't yours either.

72
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,410
So, I'll ask you again.

73
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,100
Who are you?

74
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,450
You know me?

75
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,160
To be honest with you,

76
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,540
I've forgotten everything

77
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,610
since I fell off that cliff five years ago.

78
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,450
I don't remember my name,

79
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,690
or why I'm here.

80
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,340
But I keep hearing a friend calling out to me.

81
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,540
Over and over, he calls my name,

82
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,890
yet I just can't remember.

83
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,290
There's something important I must have forgotten.

84
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,130
Why?

85
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,780
Why can't I remember?

86
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,540
Why?

87
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,000
Why can't I remember?

88
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,660
Why can't I remember?

89
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,100
I just can't seem to recall…

90
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,930
Zhang Tie,

91
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,490
don't be like this.

92
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,370
It's not your fault.

93
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,900
Zhang Tie?

94
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,660
My name is Zhang Tie?

95
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,020
You really aren't Zhang Tie.

96
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,610
There's no way you could be.

97
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,730
Though, you are very much like him.

98
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,540
Watching you eat,

99
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,170
work the forge,

100
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,660
even the way you talk…

101
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,100
I almost believed

102
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,780
he had come back.

103
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,660
But a person's eyes

104
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,930
never lie.

105
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,900
Yours are cold and calculating.

106
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,660
You couldn't possibly be him.

107
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,240
So what?

108
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,460
Why does it matter to you?

109
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,900
His life-bound artifact

110
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,660
is with you?

111
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,170
This body isn't yours.

112
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,660
Get out of it!

113
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,340
Dear,

114
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,220
what's going on?

115
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,610
Father.

116
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,410
Did you hear something?

117
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,220
There was a stray cat

118
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,700
sneaking up on our duckling.

119
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,850
We chased it away.

120
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,540
Dear.

121
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,810
And who is our guest?

122
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,020
He's a friend

123
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,730
who came looking for me.

124
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,580
Kept insisting I make him a new set of weapons.

125
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,100
I've already turned him down several times.

126
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,580
That's right.

127
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,460
I hope I didn't disturb you,

128
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:00,980
Ma'am.

129
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,140
Not at all.

130
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,170
Please, come in.

131
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:03,930
No need.

132
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,460
We'll just have a quick word,

133
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,780
then I'll be on my way.

134
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,850
Yue, help your mother back to her room.

135
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,050
Close the door. It's windy.

136
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,700
Go on.

137
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,340
- Hurry. - Go on.

138
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,170
Go inside.

139
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,250
Speak.

140
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,250
Who are you?

141
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,100
If you tell the truth,

142
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,900
I promise I won't harm them.

143
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,340
But if you lie,

144
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,730
well, you can try me.

145
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:34,980
I was injured

146
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,220
in a battle against an enemy.

147
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,540
I was desperate and took this body.

148
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,460
I had no choice.

149
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,810
Please forgive me.

150
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,290
At least that sounds reasonable.

151
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,980
Which sect are you from?

152
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,580
I'm from Spirit Beast Mountain.

153
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,540
Are you also

154
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,170
with the Seven Sects?

155
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,700
Oh, you're from the Spirit Beast Mountain.

156
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,930
How's your Senior Zhong Wu doing?

157
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,580
You know Senior Zhong Wu?

158
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,700
That's good to hear.

159
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,020
Looks like we're all acquainted.

160
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,700
Yes.

161
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,460
All acquaintances.

162
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,780
Zhong Wu cut ties with Spirit Beast Mountain a long time ago.

163
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,220
Still not ready to tell the truth?

164
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,730
I'll talk!

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,410
I'll talk.

166
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,250
I'm a disciple

167
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,140
of the Beast Taming Sect under the Tiandu Kingdom.

168
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,490
The Six Demonic Sects?

169
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,660
Yes.

170
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,290
Years ago,

171
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,220
I fought someone here

172
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,170
and was seriously injured.

173
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,900
My body was destroyed,

174
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,900
and in desperation,

175
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,610
I let my primordial spirit leave the body.

176
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,580
Just when I had lost all hope,

177
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,060
I found this empty vessel without a soul.

178
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,460
But

179
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,490
after entering this body,

180
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,490
my cultivation plummeted.

181
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,650
To avoid that powerful enemy,

182
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,100
I disguised myself as an ordinary man

183
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,100
and made a living

184
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,420
with a blacksmith

185
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,420
in the city.

186
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,370
Over time,

187
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,730
I got close to the townspeople,

188
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,460
and someone even tried to matchmake for me.

189
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,770
Eventually,

190
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,180
she became my wife,

191
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,130
and that child became my daughter.

192
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,890
Before I knew it,

193
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,980
five years had passed just like that.

194
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,300
You never thought

195
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,730
about going back?

196
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,700
In the demonic sects, it's all survival of the fittest.

197
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,580
Now that I'm weak,

198
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,980
if I returned,

199
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,890
my own fellow sect members would likely kill me.

200
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,700
Besides,

201
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,530
these hands are better suited to the forge

202
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,820
than the battlefield.

203
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,890
Life is peaceful now.

204
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,980
Why would I want to go back to a world of endless killing?

205
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,010
Peaceful?

206
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,650
The demonic sects have already taken over the eastern region of Yue Kingdom.

207
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,700
How long do you think

208
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,770
this peace will last?

209
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,890
Already?

210
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,060
That can't be. It's far too soon.

211
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,610
You're not an ordinary demonic cultivator.

212
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,580
Tell me.

213
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,060
Who are you, really?

214
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,730
No matter who I used to be,

215
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,980
that part of me is gone now.

216
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,460
Why press me for answers?

217
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,490
Take my advice.

218
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,530
The Seven Sects will lose.

219
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,060
Make your move early.

220
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,130
Don't lose your life in vain.

221
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,220
This man knows more than he's letting on.

222
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,130
I'll have to pry more information out of him.

223
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,490
Right now, the battle is at a stalemate.

224
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,730
The Seven Sects are united against the demonic sects,

225
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,010
but talk of victory or defeat

226
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,420
seems a little premature.

227
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,180
There's a long and bitter history between the Seven Sects

228
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,940
and the Six Demonic Sects.

229
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,580
Cultivators are innately selfish.

230
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,010
Backstabbing is nothing new.

231
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,370
The so-called impenetrable alliance of the Seven Sects

232
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,820
has already been

233
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,250
thoroughly infiltrated by us.

234
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,010
In fact,

235
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,100
Spirit Beast Mountain

236
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,100
is the Beast Taming Sect's spy here.

237
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,220
The Six Demonic Sects

238
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,730
will win this battle.

239
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,490
Spirit Beast Mountain pretended to defect,

240
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,340
then wiped out two Core Formation Stage cultivators from the demonic sects.

241
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,010
Everyone in the Seven Sects knows that story.

242
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,650
This whole "spy" thing

243
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,460
was just a lie to fool the ignorant.

244
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,490
Without those Core Formation cultivators "dying,"

245
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,770
would the Seven Sects have so easily trusted us?

246
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,730
Besides,

247
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,190
do you genuinely believe the ones who died

248
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,520
were actually Core Formation cultivators?

249
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,850
As far as I know,

250
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,060
the Six Demonic Sects have

251
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,250
at least three secret techniques that forcefully boost

252
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,850
a Foundation Establishment cultivator to appear

253
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,060
as a Core Formation one.

254
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,610
The effect doesn't last long,

255
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,420
but long enough to deceive your people.

256
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,010
Give me one reason not to kill you.

257
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,180
If you spare me,

258
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,250
I'll tell you where I've been hiding.

259
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,650
All the artifacts and gems there

260
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,820
will be yours.

261
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,650
They are of no use

262
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,580
to this body

263
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,010
anyway.

264
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,420
You expect me to believe your generosity?

265
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,610
You're calculating, that's for sure.

266
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,460
Fine.

267
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,300
Given how things have turned out,

268
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,490
I'll hand over the artifacts and gems

269
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,300
as well as the jade slips and letters

270
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,300
that detail my sect's dealings

271
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,220
with Spirit Beast Mountain.

272
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,370
If what you find

273
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,490
isn't enough,

274
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,340
go ahead and kill me right here.

275
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,100
I won't complain.

276
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,060
But please,

277
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,180
spare my wife and daughter.

278
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,460
They're mere mortals.

279
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,010
They've done nothing wrong.

280
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,060
Something about this feels off.

281
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,220
Better to be cautious.

282
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,060
Where can I find the items?

283
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,650
Right here.

284
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,650
If you're not convinced,

285
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,610
I'll go with you.

286
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,820
You seem impatient.

287
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,220
You'll have to wait right here until I get back.

288
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,530
Such a crude trap.

289
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,890
You think too little of me.

290
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:53,980
Go.

291
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,820
What's…

292
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,770
It's fast.

293
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,650
It even blocked off my escape.

294
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,340
[Goldenback Demon Mantis]

295
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,900
What kind of demon beast is this?

296
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,090
It even flies.

297
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,620
Even if it's not Level 5,

298
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,860
it's at least peak Level 4.

299
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,570
That's enough to hold its own against a Core Formation cultivator.

300
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,660
My Mother-Child Blades!

301
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,620
This loss

302
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,660
cuts deep.

303
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,570
If this keeps up,

304
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,140
it's only a matter of time before I get caught.

305
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,810
This better work.

306
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,460
That was too close.

307
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,250
I nearly lost my life back there.

308
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,620
This place isn't far from Jiayuan City.

309
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,290
A demon beast that strong

310
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,980
can't be wild.

311
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,010
It probably belongs

312
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,940
to that man from the Beast Taming Sect.

313
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,700
No Foundation Establishment cultivator

314
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,380
could control a creature like this.

315
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,660
Could that guy

316
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,010
have been a Core Formation cultivator?

317
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,620
Curses.

318
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,660
The pouch I risked everything to retrieve

319
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,010
is empty.

320
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,220
All right.

321
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,220
So you set me up.

322
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,220
Don't blame me for what happens next.

323
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,900
You're still alive.

324
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,050
That pill has a strange effect.

325
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,490
It pushed his power straight up to Mid Foundation Stage.

326
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,730
Blood Spirit Drill!

327
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,490
The Verdant Sword.

328
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,900
That's a Core Formation Stage artifact.

329
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:50,940
A Spirit Companion,

330
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,050
a Core Formation Stage artifact,

331
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,220
and a Golden Core.

332
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,620
This man was definitely

333
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,220
a Core Formation Stage cultivator.

334
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,250
Even…

335
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,460
Even the Goldenback Demon Mantis couldn't kill you.

336
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,620
Being bested by you today

337
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,290
is no dishonor…

338
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,490
You are indeed a Core Formation cultivator.

339
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,660
Any last words?

340
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,900
Father!

341
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,770
Dear!

342
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,940
What happened to you?

343
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,090
They…

344
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,290
They had nothing to do with this.

345
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,220
Please…

346
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,330
Please do not harm them…

347
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,700
Was I the one who harmed them?

348
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,730
You should know this already.

349
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,380
Your body is steeped in dark aura.

350
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,250
Just being near you

351
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,140
drains their life force.

352
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,730
They don't have much time left.

353
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,180
You think I don't know that?

354
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,940
All the cultivation I have left

355
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,860
is sealed inside this broken core.

356
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,900
Once they take it,

357
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,090
it will restore their vitality

358
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,140
and extend their lives.

359
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,940
You knew this day would come.

360
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,620
Father…

361
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,220
I spent half my life committing evil,

362
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,140
and now the last thing I do

363
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,050
is for two mortals…

364
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,140
Dear…

365
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,420
Father,

366
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,980
please don't die.

367
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,900
The things I promised

368
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,250
are on my real body

369
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,290
in the cave.

370
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,380
I wasn't lying.

371
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,770
The messages with Spirit Beast Mountain,

372
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,770
and my identity token,

373
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,140
will prove everything.

374
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,420
I leave the rest to you.

375
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,090
Thank you…

376
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,090
When you wake,

377
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,730
forget all of this…

378
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,010
Cultivator,

379
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,620
in your world,

380
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,620
what's genuine

381
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,490
and what's forged?

382
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,730
Now,

383
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,330
it's time to figure out how to handle that demon beast.

384
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,620
The Five Phases Reversing Array

385
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,570
has never let me down.

386
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,250
This has to be the remains of that Beast Taming Sect cultivator.

387
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,900
With wounds like those,

388
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,490
it's no surprise he didn't even have time to retrieve his mystic pouch.

389
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,460
This is a Spirit Companion Beast Egg.

390
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,180
These insects are unbelievably tough.

391
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,330
The Beast Taming Sect

392
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,050
does have some skill.

393
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,010
"Compendium of Mystical Insects."

394
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,490
Blood Jade Spider,

395
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,900
ranked 108.

396
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,980
Goldenback Demon Mantis, ranked 73.

397
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,770
Gold-devouring Bug,

398
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,290
ranked 12.

399
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,620
Seriously?

400
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,700
You're kidding.

401
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,490
That Goldenback Demon Mantis

402
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,010
ranks just 73?

403
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,290
"A Guide to Breeding and Commanding Them."

404
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,660
Never mind.

405
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,530
I'll study this when I have the time.

406
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,660
Found it.

407
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,460
Correspondence between Spirit Beast Mountain and the Beast Taming Sect.

408
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,220
Your master is dead.

409
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,940
You can rest now.

410
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,860
The damage you caused to my artifact

411
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,180
will be repaid using your materials.

412
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:46,980
Qu Hun,

413
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,220
I'll craft you a proper armor with this.

414
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,700
The matter's wrapped up.

415
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,660
It's time to report back.

416
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,330
No matter the outcome,

417
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,900
I have done my part.

418
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,420
Elder Han rose to fame in a single battle.

419
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,180
I'm nowhere near that level.

420
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,570
Even with the stalemate at Golden Drum Plains,

421
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,090
you still hold everything together.

422
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:27,900
I respect that.

423
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,330
At this point,

424
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,860
the Seven Sects are on the verge of destruction.

425
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,570
No one can afford to sit this out.

426
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,140
Watching our disciples storm the battlefield one after another,

427
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,380
how could an old man like me

428
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,140
just stand aside?

429
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,050
Even if not for myself,

430
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,290
I must fight

431
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,900
for all my disciples.

432
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,700
Everyone!

433
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,660
Look who just showed up!

434
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,380
No one going to give me a proper welcome?

435
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,900
Shameless.

436
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,010
You show up late

437
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,050
and expect a grand entrance?

438
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,220
I'm late?

439
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,490
My apologies.

440
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,090
Han,

441
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,380
when did you arrive?

442
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,860
Just got here myself.

443
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,660
See? We're about the same.

444
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,050
Enough.

445
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,090
I'm hungry

446
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,900
and thirsty.

447
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,980
Bring out

448
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,010
the best pastries

449
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,140
from Yellow Maple Valley.

450
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:13,810
No pastries,

451
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:14,980
but plenty of sand.

452
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,460
Want some?

453
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,140
Enough banter.

454
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,770
Let's get down to business.

455
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,980
Take out

456
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,980
your upgraded

457
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,490
Level 4 demon beast mahjong set.

458
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,050
Waging war every day

459
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,330
gets tedious.

460
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,980
We need a way to relieve some tension.

461
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:28,940
Now that's more like it.

462
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,660
Put that away.

463
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,290
Fu Yunzi,

464
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,140
stop turning up

465
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,700
just to eat and play.

466
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,860
We called you here for a serious matter.

467
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,250
That's right.

468
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,530
Hongfu, please speak.

469
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,940
Our scouts on the front lines

470
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,660
have observed signs that the demonic sects may launch

471
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,530
an offensive at the start of next month.

472
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,620
Huayuan and I are planning to send a group

473
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,290
to strike their rear lines.

474
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,140
Hit them where they least expect it?

475
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,090
Hongfu,

476
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,380
that's a brilliant strategy!

477
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,010
How about

478
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,250
we make a wager

479
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,250
on the outcome?

480
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,700
You want to bet on this, too?

481
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,770
What are you betting on, success or failure?

482
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,860
Success, of course.

483
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,570
And the rest of us?

484
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,420
Failure.

485
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,380
Get out of here!

486
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,380
Getting out of here…

487
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,660
Dear Master,

488
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,180
this is Han Li, your disciple,

489
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,460
sending my respects.

490
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,700
I have returned

491
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,490
to the valley to cultivate in seclusion.

492
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,140
All is well within the valley.

493
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,700
My thoughts are with you

494
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,090
and you alone.

495
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,900
The situation at the front remains uncertain.

496
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,490
On my journey back,

497
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,620
I uncovered evidence of collusion

498
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,490
between Spirit Beast Mountain

499
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,810
and the Beast Taming Sect.

500
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:35,940
I have submitted

501
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,530
this proof to the Sect Master.

502
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,900
For the sake of morale and caution,

503
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:40,980
the Sect Master

504
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,090
has chosen to keep this matter

505
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,660
undisclosed.

506
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,460
I fear it may affect

507
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,050
the front lines

508
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,090
and place you and the other mentors in danger.

509
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,810
Though it breaks protocol,

510
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:54,660
I felt compelled

511
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,490
to write.

512
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,700
May you remain vigilant.

513
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,010
I have done all I can from afar.

514
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,420
Master, may this message

515
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,530
reach you

516
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,770
in time

517
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,860
to avert disaster.

518
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,290
The great war approaches.

519
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,010
You must keep yourself safe too.

520
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,700
The Goldenback Demon Mantis armor…

521
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,290
is too small.

522
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,090
They've already hatched.

523
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,980
And they eat

524
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,380
so much.

525
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,770
I suppose

526
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,660
not all cultivators can afford to keep Spirit Companions.

527
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,180
I should find time

528
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,810
to visit the Herbs Garden.

529
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:20,860
Get in.

530
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,570
Master replied already?

531
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,090
Do you remember our promise

532
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,460
to admire the flowers

533
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,900
beneath Baili Mountain?

534
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,380
Maybe you can go on my behalf?

535
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,460
Senior Chen.

536
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,740
When I was young,

537
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,010
my mother often brought me here

538
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,380
to gather wild chrysanthemums.

539
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,610
To her,

540
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,690
no flower was more beautiful

541
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,900
than these wild chrysanthemums.

542
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,260
But after she passed away

543
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,010
a few years ago,

544
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,900
I stopped coming.

545
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:50,940
Senior,

546
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:51,940
please accept my condolences.

547
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,860
It's all right.

548
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,860
To her,

549
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,300
it might have been a release from the burdens she carried.

550
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,380
She was also married into the Chen family through a political alliance.

551
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,820
Before their wedding,

552
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,210
she and my father had never met.

553
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,820
After marriage, they treated each other with respect,

554
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,010
but I know

555
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,210
they never truly opened up to one another.

556
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,170
Do you think

557
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,900
it's unbecoming for me as a cultivator

558
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,170
to always be caught up

559
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,820
in matters of love?

560
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,490
Not at all.

561
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,340
Sadly, you don't understand.

562
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,490
For women born into noble families,

563
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,860
from the day we are born,

564
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,050
our lives

565
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,210
no longer belong to ourselves.

566
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,900
We train day after day,

567
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,980
bringing benefits to our clans.

568
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,340
Maybe, just maybe, 1 prodigy out of 10,000

569
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,420
might earn the trust of the Seven Sects within 100 years

570

and gain the right to choose their fate.

571
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,570
But most of them

572
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,940
end up like me.

573
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,900
You're being too modest.

574
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,340
Since you entered the valley,

575
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,530
your diligence

576
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,460
and calmness in all matters

577
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,860
have surely not gone unnoticed by anyone.

578
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,010
Even if you're not a prodigy,

579
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,610
you're well beyond

580
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,460
the average clan disciple.

581
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,610
You know that's not the answer I wanted to hear.

582
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,010
The reason I asked to see you today

583
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,530
is

584
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,820
that I may soon

585
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,300
be married.

586
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,780
The groom is the son of the Qi family.

587
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,940
We've never met,

588
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,340
but I've heard

589
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,340
he's a man of decent character.

590
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,880
War is raging across the land,

591
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,690
and no one is safe.

592
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,010
If the Chen family can form an alliance with them

593
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:53,900
and find shelter from the chaos,

594
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,420
then…

595
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,530
When we were in the Imperial Capital,

596
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,900
I saw Weiniang and Senior Liu together.

597
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,650
I found myself envying them.

598
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,740
At least they met

599
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,420
and fell in love.

600
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,340
Even if they were separated by life and death,

601
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:18,860
it was still better

602
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,650
than living an entire life trapped,

603
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,610
never free,

604
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:25,900
and dying with regrets.

605
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,610
Why?

606
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,300
Why should I be forced

607
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,940
to marry someone I've never met?

608
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,650
Why should I be passed around

609
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,050
like some commodity,

610
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,980
today to the Lu family, tomorrow to the Qi family?

611
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,050
Why should the fate of the entire clan

612
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,690
be placed on the shoulders of a single woman?

613
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,420
No one has ever asked what I want.

614
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,210
Not once.

615
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,260
Can I lean on you, just for a moment?

616
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,610
Han,

617
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,090
I know you're different.

618
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,940
Are you planning something?

619
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,050
Can you take me away from here?

620
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,460
Just take me away.

621
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,410
Anywhere will do,

622
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,010
so long…

623
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,340
so long as it's a place where I can be free.

624
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,420
I've done all of this

625
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,940
and yet

626
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,210
you still hold back.

627
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,340
You're making me feel quite embarrassed.

628
