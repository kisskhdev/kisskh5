00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.160
These numbers are insane!

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.760
Pass! It'll go to my head.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.400
7% of your followers

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.760
overlap

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.480
with Lin Anran's.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.120
Got it.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.680
And 40% came from

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.520
her fanbase.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.840
Gotta thank

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.320
the management and Anran!

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.040

one more thing.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.800
Sure.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.600

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.000
tripled this month!

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.480
Don't get cocky!

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.320
Guys,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.880

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.079
Yeah!

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.480
Alright, party on!

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.560
Thank you!

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:53.960
Triple!

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.760
Y'all terrible, stop!

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.680
Let's see...

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.120
one, two, three...

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.920
five zeros!

1.6 million followers!

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.720
C'mon,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.680

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.200
Everyone hit those

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.840
shopping apps,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.000
all on me!

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.640
Whoa!

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.960
It's on Ran!

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.440
Two grand limit,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.600
guys, c'mon!

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.920
You're the best!

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.360
Xiaohe,

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:48.720
this isn't fixed yet?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.560
Slipped my mind.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.360
Slipped your mind?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.440
So I don't matter...

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.280
You're done with me too?

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.280
You are

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.640
tuning me out too?

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.280
Can't stand me either, huh?

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.600
Nothing I say

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.280
matters anymore...

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.320
Everyone's

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.000
over me...

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.080
Nobody

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.880
wants me around...

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.200
Nobody listens...

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.840
Nobody gives a damn

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.280
about my feelings...

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.480
Nobody...

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.360
Anran,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.640
perhaps it's time for your meds?

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.200
Mr. Fu,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.480
you killed it last night,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.080
that's why

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.720

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.159
Funding's looking sweet!

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.960
Mr. Fu, Mr. Li,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.080
you've really knocked it

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.560
out of the park!

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.720
Nah, I barely

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.360
did anything.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.120
He did all the heavy lifting,

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.200
he's the real MVP!

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.760
There's

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.080
another gem

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.720
about you, Mr. Fu.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.040

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.440
Think I'll skip.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.200
Not my scene,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.640

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.840

If that's all,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.560
I should get going.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.240
Have a great time!

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.280
Why the rush?

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.080

Welcome aboard!

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.799
Cheers!

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.120
So, what were we?

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.280
About

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.120

his

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.520
young fiancée.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.400
No way!

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.160
Dumped the last one?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.880
Yup.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.520
Talk about fast.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.640
This place

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.680
would be ideal.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.120
We should acquire

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.080
the entire floor!

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.120
Yeah, definitely.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:09.800
Right?

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.400
For sure.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.360
Gotta keep up with

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.760
beauty routines, ladies.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.280
Anyone check out

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.200
that spa I mentioned?

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.080
Yeah,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.560
but wasn't

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.680
blown away.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.480
The oils are top-notch though.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.520
Really?

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.200
Let's do a ladies' day there!

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.440
You in?

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.720
Yeah.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.960
What else is good?

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.720
Tell us!

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.600

new fascia treatment...

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.920
Excuse me, ladies.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.560
No prob.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.200
About that treatment...

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.400
Yeah.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.360

[Great genes.]

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.840
Your wife's

the older one, right?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.360
Yep! They say

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.120
marrying up in age brings luck.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.920
I must be swimming in luck!

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:52.920
Yeah?

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.240
Lucky me!

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.280
Funny dude!

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.120
Yeah.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.000
[She's amazing to me.]

[Cool.]

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.360
Pardon me, Mr. Xing.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.560
Be right back!

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.360
Sure, make it quick.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.760
Babe, babe!

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.480
Why

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.080
sneaking out?

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.400
Just beat.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.760
Besides,

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.760
you're fine

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.680
flying solo in there...

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.000
You don't really need me here.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.040
Come on now!

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.200
Mr. Xing just introduced

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.200
some investors,

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.160
one has

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.080
Hong Kong connections.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.880
I'd love you to meet them.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.520
C'mon.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.440
Pass.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.520
Done with the

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.840
networking game.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.680
It's draining.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.680
You have fun in there.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.760
You mad?

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.480
Sorry I ditched you

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.440
back there...

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.080
Not at all.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.600
It's how these things go,

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.680
guys talk shop,

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.800
ladies gossip.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.280
Just surprised

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.440
to see you

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.320
mingling like a pro.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.960
Never knew

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.840
you had it in you,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.000
honestly.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.520
Nah,

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.520
not my thing.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.120
Just playing along.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.600
With Yudong

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.080
skipping out,

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.920
someone had to...

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.080
They need you in there.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.120
Get back.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.000
C'mon.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.160
Hey, if you're heading out,

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.080
- I'll...
- Daoqi!

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.120
I'll just say my goodbyes...

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.880
Mr. Jiang wants a word,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.120
now!

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.080
OK, coming!

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.600
C'mon!

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.000
OK.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.600
Go ahead.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.000
Let me just

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.360
wrap this up...

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.360
Head home,

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.640
I'll be quick...

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.800
Won't be long!

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.880
Better now, buddy?

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.920
It's OK!

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.480
It's OK...

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.400
Nobody's caring for you, huh?

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.840
Nobody's caring for me either.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.160
I'll dry myself.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.440
That's better, right?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.160
Didn't mean to drop by,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.080
you just came to mind.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.640
Wanna be friends?

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.880
You need a name...

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.480
Those lip movements,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.120
that'll be your name.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.360
Hey,

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.280
heads up,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.200
put your canvas

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.240
in the coop.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.320
Wind's picking up,

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.520
looks like rain coming.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.520
OK.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:57.880
Bye.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.280
Wild, right?

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.520
Last time we

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.160
saw each other

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.560
was across the globe,

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.120
now we're here.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:54.680
Totally.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.800
Doing opera then,

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.840
me stuck in banking...

00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.400
Cool.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.080
Yeah.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.120
Like some weird dream.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.800
So why're you back?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.640
Got a gallery deal.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.000
Small show coming up.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:15.000
Wow, proper artist

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.280
with gallery deals now!

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:18.720
Just messing around.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.240
Good for you.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.200
Well... you know,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.400
after Ge Kaiyang left,

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.520
opera club kinda died.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.000
No one

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.000
felt it anymore.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.040
Too bad.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.520
It's OK, it happens.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.040
You guys still talk?

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:37.800
Since coming back?

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.000
Um... when I first got back,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.160
kept in touch

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.720
for a bit,

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.400
then life got busy...

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.400
Just busy, huh?

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.720
You hungry?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.480
We can catch up

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.360
over lunch.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.240
This is your special place?

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:21.800
Still eating?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.400
Yeah.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:26.600
Alright then.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.880
Load up, won't get to

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.120
eat here later.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.640
Come on,

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.200
Malatang's everywhere.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.800
This one's special.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.360
Funny,

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.800
you're more upset about

00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.560
missing this place

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.440
than

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.880
certain people.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.120
What people?

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.080
Kaiyang, obviously.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.640
Look, I get it.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.720
He seems flaky,

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.640
not picking up,

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.440
ghosting,

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.520
I really do.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.200
But here's the thing,

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.400
he was in jail

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.760
for half a month

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.480
because someone

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.560
set him up.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.800
What?

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.200
What's going on?

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.240
Order's up!

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:33.920
Thanks.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.640
Enjoy.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.720
That's pretty much it.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:38.960
Someone

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.720
did him dirty.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.880
Remember our opera days

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.760
back in Canada?

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.960
We weren't pros,

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.680
but he was

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.520
so upbeat.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.480
Coming back here...

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.400
life kept knocking him down.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.560
He's different now.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.880
These past few months,

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.880
he's dealt with stuff

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.160
most people

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.120
never face:

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.320
parents in prison,

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.000
family turning cold,

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.200
losing loved ones,

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.600
getting detained...

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.840
Honestly, these

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.440
huge changes

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:25.920
have cost him

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.400
more than just his lifestyle.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.560
What worries me most is

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.640
he lost faith in himself,

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.800
and the ability to trust.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.480
He doesn't think

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.640
he deserves

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.680
happiness

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.720
or friendship anymore.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.360
Scared to connect,

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.240
scared to let people down.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.240
Really,

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.000
he's most scared of

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.280
letting you down.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.440
That's why he keeps his distance.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.640
Listen, Xinying,

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.360
you mean

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.000
so much more

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.880
to him than anyone else.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.680
If that's true,

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.360
why won't he face me?

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.040
[Hey,]

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.360
[listen,]

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.880
[you really should]

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.360
[come out]

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.360
[and meet Lu Xinying.]

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.120
[At least thank her properly.]

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.640
Got a power bank?

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.160
Play this.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.320
How dare ya!

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.400
Assh*le!

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.480
[Made up your mind yet?]

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.560
Ugh,

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.720
chicken sh*t.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.680
Sir, sir!

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.160
Take a look at our brochures?

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.400
Interested in North America

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.240
or Europe?

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.560
Please check these,

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.000
our advisors

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.320
can walk you through

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.240
everything later.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.360
Would you like

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.160
to sign in?

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.680
I'm here for

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.360
Lu Xinying.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.440
Eat up!

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.960
You, less; you, more.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:13.800
C'mon.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.480
C'mon, you little devil!

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.320
I crashed with

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.800
the lemurs last night,

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.600
had a bad dream.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
How was your sleep?

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.200
Gonna check on Grandma.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.560
Back to your sleep.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.320
Not sleepy today.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.960
Slacked off at work last night.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.200
Gonna talk to Fran.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.440
It got caught in the rain.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.280
That's

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.600
the rain-blessed look I wanted.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.400
Took Happy out?

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.880
Yep, otherwise he'd burst.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.560
Pigeons fed?

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.160
Yep. Couldn't let them starve.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.320
Up all night

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.000
and still micromanaging?

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.400
Rain last night

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.040
got a lemur all worked up.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.800
I fell asleep

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:46.880
keeping it company.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.080
Slacking off was a smart move.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.040
Don't know

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.440
why I crashed there.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.840
Maybe I just don't click with people.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.800
Animals make me feel secure.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.320
I had this dream.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.040
It got me thinking:

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.720
is getting hit with

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.720
every possible bad thing

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.200
some kinda weird miracle?

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.200
Look, giving up is

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.120
the easy way out.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.960
It's human nature.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.120
The important part is

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.440
pushing forward and staying positive.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:19.600
You know what,

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.800
I saw Xinying the other day.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:21.720
She's waiting for

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.760
you to reach out.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:23.960
I'll text you her address.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.080
Go see her.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.080
If you're uncertain,

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:27.840
perhaps consult

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.560
your furry friends?

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.160
Quit with

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.600
the judgey eyes.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.640
I did go see her.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.120
Must you act

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.160
so judgmental?

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.760
I stood outside forever.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.120
I swear I was there.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.080
Don't believe me?

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.120
OK, truth time.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.240
I messed up,

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.080
I really did.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.600
That sword was

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.480
barely a hair

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.520
from my neck.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.160
If I got

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.320
a do-over,

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.000
I'd tell her how sorry I am.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.120
I really screwed up.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.680
Catch you guys later.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.680
Gotta see

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.800
another buddy.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.920
Whoa there,

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.000
speedy!

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.320
Sorry, sir.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.680
Just dropping off a phone

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.680
for my friend.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:59.720
Closed,

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.720
can't you tell?

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:01.680
Yeah, yeah,

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.760
he's got night shift.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.880
Quick drop-off?

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.160
Who you here for?

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.120
Ge Kaiyang.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:07.920
Who're you?

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.120
His friend.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.520
He's got friends?

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:12.720
Yeah!

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.760
Forget it. Closed.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.200
Go home.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:19.840
Hey,

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.000
come on,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
can I just

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.560
wait here?

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.240
Did you eat?

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.240
Got some food

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.440
and drinks to share.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.200
Stop,

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.200
it won't work on me.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:29.760
Take a look.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.200
Might like what I got...

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.320
Never giving up, huh?

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.800
How about a drink?

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.280
Gotta admit,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.840
this wine's weird

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.600
but it grows on you.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.440
Ah,

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.880
you know your stuff!

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.720
Don't know much about wine.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.040
Next time,

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.400
I'll bring some Maotai.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.360
Nah, that's

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.480
too fancy for me.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:56.520
C'mon,

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.320
just a gesture.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.760
Y'know,

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.680
of all the young guys I've met,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:03.960
you're actually alright.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:04.920
For real?

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.080
Thanks.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.000
I really like

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.960
hanging out with you.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.960
Cheers!

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.840
Cheers!

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.440
Knock yourself out!

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.200
Gotta work.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.840
What's up?

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.760
This is

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.880
all new to me.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.200
Not bad, right?

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.200
Yeah,

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.000
though I don't know

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.040
what half this stuff is.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.480
Come visit me

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.440
since we get to know each other.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.520
Sure, I'll

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.520
drop by sometime.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.440
Cool.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.560
Got some treats for you.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.160
Am I just a pain?

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.480
Totally worthless?

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.840
Why don't you carry your phone?

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.080
Left it at home.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.600
This place isn't

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.160
even on camera,

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:26.920
but you found it.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.000
How'd you get in here?

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:28.960
Front door,

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.360
duh.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.720
The guard and I

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.400
are buddies now,

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.160
like family.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.280
You're good.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.480
So, did you see her?

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:42.960
Dude...

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.080
Why'd you bother

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.080
spending time

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:46.560
with...

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.920
The hack is this ugly thing?

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:15.840
Come on.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.280
Happy, potty time.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.600
He's going

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:29.719
downhill.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.600
Can't keep

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.679
hiding with animals.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.159
Gotta help him out.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.159
Happy,

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.920
this is the right thing

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.000
to do, isn't it?

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.920
Is it gonna work?

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:52.560
Yo, say something.

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:54.880
You're just as indecisive

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.639
as him.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Blink for yes.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.520
Sure, following your plan!

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.400
You'll take the heat

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.000
if it goes wrong, OK?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.120
That's reassuring.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.560
Give me paw, buddy!

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:16.400
C'mon!

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.920
What brings you here?

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.080
Got a ticket like everyone else.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.000
Din Tai Fung, remember?

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.440
Had it in Canada.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.200
It's amazing.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.360
Try it, same taste.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.520
You paid 198 admission

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.200
just to

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.720
deliver some buns?

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.000
You eating or not? They're closing.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.000
I'll get booted

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.880
with the buns soon.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.400
I'm literally covered in sh*t.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.640
Can't eat them in here.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:56.680
Don't throw money around

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:57.880
like I used to.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:58.880
Great,

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.160
I try to be nice

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.080
and get a financial lecture.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.800
Feed them to your pals.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.920
You seem close.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.640
Getting offended?

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.240
See why animals

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.280
are easier than people?

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.640
Whatever floats your boat.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.320
What a killer spot!

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.240
Would be epic for

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.240
my exhibition!

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.760
Remember that rainy day

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.120
I spent here?

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:48.840
I fell asleep here.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.200
Just dropping by.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.480
Get down!

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.640
What's with the outfit?

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.160
For my new gig.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.680
Looking sharp!

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.240
Right? Better than you.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:14.800
How's my

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.560
new office?

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.720
You're really taking this job?

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.000
Sure am! Perfect setup,

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.840
study birds,

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:22.720
get inspiration,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.640
earn money. Win-win-win.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.880
Do you need money?

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.360
Dude, everyone needs money.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.720
Hey buddy,

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.880
water's for our bird friends,

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:31.520
OK?

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.920
Be nice to them,

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:33.600
and they'll be

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.200
nice back,

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:34.840
yeah?

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.280
Thanks!

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.520
Sure, sure.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.320
Excuse me.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.880
That'd be tricky though...

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.920
Donno if...

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.920
Excuse me, miss,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:45.960
that your child?

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.600
Yeah, yeah.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.440
Could you watch him?

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.240
We're closing soon.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.280
Alright, Mr. Lin,

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.920
call you in ten minutes.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.040
Got something here.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:52.880
Sorry about that.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.280
Jiayi, drop that.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.040
Let's go!

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.800
Put that down!

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.240
It's dirty. Let's go.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.000
Bye!

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.880
I'm off.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.040
Have fun on night shift, peace!

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:12.800
Hey,

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.080
the supervisor and I

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.400
are tight now.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.000
Need anything?

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:17.840
I've got

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.200
connections now.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.280
Your academic record

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.120
looks good.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.000
But considering your age,

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.480
I'd suggest

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.400
staying here

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.520
a while longer

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.920
to strengthen

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:46.880
your basics.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:47.840
No need to rush.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:48.640
[Water.]

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.400
[You've got a point.]

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.160
[Maybe building basics]

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:54.840
[is crucial.]

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:55.960
[Thanks]

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.000
[for the advice.]

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.360
You didn't have to

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.080
pick me up.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.400
No worries.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.680
The pin can be off sometimes.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.000
I was close by.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.360
Alright.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.440
Maybe

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.160
I'm too casual

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.560
for your show?

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.080
We're dressed alike.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.400
Just leave that purse.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.040
C'mon!

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.680
Outfit ain't important.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.920
The art is.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.480
Big-time artist

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.560
with a late-night show,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.560
still on Canadian time?

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.320
Art shows aren't

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.440
just for daylight hours,

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.280
you know?

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.800
I had no idea.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.760
There you go,

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.320
free education strikes again!

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:11.960
Getting drowsy?

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.520
Nope, totally awake.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.320
Yeah.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.680
Better be.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.040
Thanks!

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.040
Your show's

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.400
at the zoo?

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.320
Throws you off, huh?

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:42.640
Give me a sec.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.200
Someone's coming for you.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.120
Don't go anywhere.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.840
Hi there!

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.800
Did Fran send you?

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.000
Ah, Fran got you to come too.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.360
Well, come in,

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:32.680
got the whole place

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:35.760
to ourselves.
