00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:16.908
Welcome back to the
7th Wordsmith Youth Championship!

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.827
Maybe in the next tournament,

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.104
Possenti might also
make it to the championship

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.814
if your child plays.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.762
Cheaters.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.326
I'm sure you know what that means.

00:00:34.586 --> 00:00:36.045
Welcome to Possenti.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.447
The school’s really big.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.290
The facilities are great, but...

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.375
the student culture there feels different.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.169
I was wondering if you could help me.

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.372
I heard you play and you’re really good!

00:00:46.397 --> 00:00:48.649
if you want, I can tutor you in Math.

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:52.552
If your grades go up, maybe you can
audition in the next production.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:56.372
These are the exercises Sir Sevilla
gave his tutorial students.

00:00:56.397 --> 00:00:58.395
He hasn’t discussed this in class yet.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.603
You really think what you did
with Grace was right?

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.286
I’m Bank,

00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:04.022
Tristan Bangkat.

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.398
I’m the one you took the scholarship from.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:06.274
Thirty thousand?

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:07.525
Sure. No problem.

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:08.526
One condition.

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:12.280
Your score and Grace’s should be lower
than mine, so it’s not obvious.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.997
Eraser. Hand it over.

00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:26.269
Eraser.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:27.294
Hand it over.

00:01:55.626 --> 00:01:57.378
I'm done answering my exams, sir.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.878
I believe I can go now.

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:03.414
Continue answering.

00:02:03.588 --> 00:02:04.642
No one's allowed to talk.

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:12.966
Estrella, Estrella, Estrella!

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.299
Let's talk.

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:18.972
Oh my god,
what did he saw?

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.074
Do you want your classmates
to be mad at you?

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.061
Why would they be mad?

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:26.906
You know what I mean.

00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:29.620
You’re smart —
you don’t need to do this.

00:02:30.662 --> 00:02:32.456
All of you will be in deep trouble.

00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:33.899
It's not worth it.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.912
Are we the ones in trouble?

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.450
Or is it you?

00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:51.911
With all due respect, sir.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:54.007
You accuse me of cheating,

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.717
but I have proof that
you leak out

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:58.678
exam questionnaires to paying
clients of your tutorial class.

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:01.320
Isn’t that also considered cheating?

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:07.553
Come on, Hon.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:24.787
That’s different.

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:27.957
Of course, you’re a scholar.

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:31.660
You don’t need tutorials
just to pass your exams.

00:03:32.451 --> 00:03:33.452
But what about the rest?

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:37.800
There’s a saying:

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.179
you cannot judge a fish
by its ability to climb a tree.

00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:44.365
So how about the others?

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.060
They’re smart in other ways,
but they’ll fail.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.355
Their lives could be ruined
just because of one subject like calculus.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:52.815
Can you really blame them?

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.027
Just leave them alone.

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:58.384
Fine, sir.

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.409
If that’s what you want.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.199
Come on!

00:04:07.673 --> 00:04:09.467
Wait, are you
recording our conversation?

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.417
I’m not recording anything.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.337
Hand over your phone, you liar.

00:04:16.176 --> 00:04:17.261
Guys go back to your seats.

00:04:17.286 --> 00:04:19.121
Faster! Hurry up,
hurry up!

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.598
I’m not lying.

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.517
I didn’t record anything.

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.021
Thank you for telling the truth.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.390
I will tell the principal

00:04:36.415 --> 00:04:38.959
that you gave answers
to your classmates.

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:41.446
With all due respect, sir.

00:04:42.085 --> 00:04:43.128
you don’t have proof.

00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:45.051
But,

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:47.078
I could say Grace’s score went up

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:49.121
because of your tutorial class.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:52.207
My phone, sir?

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:00.674
Thank you.

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:51.350
- Lin!
- Sis!

00:05:51.783 --> 00:05:52.783
Are you okay?

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:55.854
I’m fine.

00:05:56.397 --> 00:05:57.607
Don’t worry about me.

00:05:57.888 --> 00:05:59.272
What happened in there?

00:05:59.297 --> 00:06:00.590
Your plan worked perfectly.

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:02.904
You were amazing, sis.

00:06:03.132 --> 00:06:04.030
You were right.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.115
No one noticed when
I swapped their questionnaires.

00:06:06.615 --> 00:06:08.426
And the look on Mr. Sevilla’s face

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.036
when he saw the note on the eraser?

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:11.469
Priceless!

00:06:11.797 --> 00:06:14.436
Yeah, I didn't expect you'd
be so good at acting.

00:06:14.461 --> 00:06:15.558
You were like,

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:17.376
I'm done answering my exam, sir.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.210
And he actually thought you
called the principal?

00:06:23.444 --> 00:06:24.150
Hey.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.469
Just make sure you put my
name back on your phone.

00:06:27.228 --> 00:06:28.228
Of course.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.099
But, guys.

00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:35.686
Sir Sevilla did look really mad when
he came back into the room.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.397
Are you sure he’s
not going to report us?

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:40.816
I'm sure he won't.

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:02.839
Do you know that guy from Section B?

00:07:02.864 --> 00:07:03.664
Bank?

00:07:12.708 --> 00:07:14.031
Let’s go, guys.

00:07:14.076 --> 00:07:15.577
Let’s drop by the cafe.
I’m starving.

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.952
Education should be for everyone.

00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:34.863
Not just for those who can afford it.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.290
A 2,000-peso testing fee
is an added burden

00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:40.543
for both students and parents.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:41.543
Right?

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.131
Several student leaders
have strongly condemned

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.884
the implementation of the
National College Entrance Test,

00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:49.302
or NCET.

00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:52.138
The NCET mandate was approved
to continue addressing the decline

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:55.850
in the quality of high school education

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.268
after the pandemic.

00:07:57.268 --> 00:08:00.396
It will be implemented starting
next academic year.

00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:24.295
Oh, Lin.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:25.504
Did you get the money?

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:27.008
We had a deal, didn’t we?

00:08:27.438 --> 00:08:29.926
Why did the GC say
Mr. Sevilla was terminated?

00:08:30.152 --> 00:08:31.508
How did the principal find out?

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:33.554
Chill out, Lin.

00:08:33.554 --> 00:08:36.015
Okay fine, I sent the
recording to the principal.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.266
What recording?

00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:38.476
When you called my phone,

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:40.228
I recorded Mr. Sevilla’s voice.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:41.062
But don’t worry.

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:42.230
I edited your voice out of the clip.

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:43.981
But why?

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:45.750
Pat!

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:46.984
We agreed

00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:48.611
we were just going to scare him.

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:49.820
I told you, guys.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.680
He’s not going to bother me again!

00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:53.498
I already said that, Pat.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:55.617
I don’t trust him.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.771
What if he retaliates
and gets us in trouble?

00:08:57.995 --> 00:08:59.455
Besides, why do you even care?

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:00.830
You two close or something?

00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:26.481
Grace.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.447
Big Sis!

00:10:15.656 --> 00:10:16.656
Simon.

00:10:19.493 --> 00:10:20.953
Aren’t you with your boyfriend?

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:23.959
He’s not my boyfriend.

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.417
And why are you here in
the high school wing again?

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:27.418
Don’t you have classes?

00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:30.275
Daddy said to wait for him here.

00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:36.235
- Simon.
- Daddy!

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.445
Let’s go.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.571
Daddy!

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:41.724
She's the one who
helped me get my toy.

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:48.064
I invited my classmates
to my birthday party.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.524
We're having a big party, right?

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.195
Uhh, Daddy will find a way.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:56.280
Daddy, carry me, please.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.450
You're not so little anymore, huh?

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:21.282
- Please do my laundry.
- Okay, sir.

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:22.933
Would you like to avail of soap?

00:12:23.382 --> 00:12:24.079
Yeah.

00:12:24.104 --> 00:12:25.730
Yes please, I already left
a payment for that.

00:12:25.877 --> 00:12:27.759
- Here’s the rest.
- Thanks again, okay?

00:12:27.784 --> 00:12:28.848
- I’ll take care of this.
- Alright.

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:29.873
Okay.

00:12:34.348 --> 00:12:35.095
Oh.

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:36.251
What happened here?

00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:40.009
- Gosh! - What’s this?

00:12:40.449 --> 00:12:41.402
Oh no.

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:42.094
What?!

00:12:42.094 --> 00:12:43.195
It's broken again

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.478
Unbelievable, Mang Estong!

00:12:45.503 --> 00:12:48.131
I just had it
serviced a month ago!

00:12:48.225 --> 00:12:49.689
This is so frustrating!

00:12:49.776 --> 00:12:50.786
I’m going to confront him!

00:12:50.811 --> 00:12:51.912
- Oops.
- That geezer!

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:53.105
Take it easy.

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:55.274
Ma, take it easy.

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:57.782
You’re not an action star
out for revenge, okay?

00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:00.362
But come on!

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.483
I just had this fixed.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.118
Ma, maybe we need to take it

00:13:06.118 --> 00:13:07.703
to the actual service center

00:13:07.703 --> 00:13:09.663
- to make sure it’s done properly.
- No, no.

00:13:09.663 --> 00:13:10.915
Not there. It’s too expensive.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.376
Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it.

00:13:12.401 --> 00:13:13.401
Alright, fine.

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:14.792
Go ahead.

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:16.545
Wait, wait.

00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:18.297
Ma, are you really going
to wash all that by hand?

00:13:18.322 --> 00:13:19.757
- Of course!
- That's too much!

00:13:20.239 --> 00:13:21.239
Oh, son.

00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:25.836
That’s Mrs. Reyes’ laundry.

00:13:25.861 --> 00:13:26.906
It's embarrassing,

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:28.015
she’s one of our regulars.

00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:30.017
I need to finish that for tomorrow.

00:13:30.017 --> 00:13:31.185
No, it’s okay. I’ll do it, Ma.

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:31.769
Let me do it.

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:33.270
You? Seriously?

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:34.730
Good grief.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:35.856
Go study already.

00:13:35.856 --> 00:13:37.483
- I got this.
- Ma, I’m done.

00:13:37.725 --> 00:13:39.210
You take a rest, okay?

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.319
Because later tonight,

00:13:40.467 --> 00:13:41.670
you’ll start whining again.

00:13:41.695 --> 00:13:43.989
You’ll be saying, “ouch, ouch, ouch.”
my back hurts!

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:44.990
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.325
I don’t sound like that!

00:13:46.431 --> 00:13:47.493
You brat.

00:13:47.518 --> 00:13:48.603
Let me do this, Ma.

00:13:48.628 --> 00:13:53.257
Welcome to tonight’s exciting
6/45 mega lotto draw!

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:54.583
Oh, lotto time.

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:58.837
We’re about to reveal the
winning numbers for the 6/45 lotto draw.

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:05.344
Tonight’s jackpot prize
is seventy six million,

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:09.848
five hundred thirty seven thousand and
ninety one pesos and 29 cents.

00:14:10.114 --> 00:14:12.992
Here are the numbers
in no particular order.

00:14:13.555 --> 00:14:16.642
The first number is twenty six.

00:14:17.266 --> 00:14:18.359
Yes!

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:21.902
The next number, thirty one!

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:23.571
That’s two!

00:14:24.068 --> 00:14:25.068
Next, six.

00:14:25.793 --> 00:14:26.793
Third number...

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.617
- Six!
- Oh!

00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:29.535
It's three already, son!

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:30.763
We got three now!

00:14:30.788 --> 00:14:33.374
Ma, we’ve got fifty percent
chance of winning.

00:14:33.658 --> 00:14:34.724
Fourth number...

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:36.500
is eleven.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.500
Oh my god.

00:14:38.168 --> 00:14:39.168
Four already!

00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:41.463
The fifth number is...

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.345
number forty.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:43.983
Ah!

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:44.733
Oh no!

00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:48.429
Ma, we’ve got an eighty eight point
thirty three percent chance now.

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:49.655
Just one more, one more.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.472
One number to go.

00:14:50.472 --> 00:14:53.350
And the last number
to get the jackpot prize

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.893
of seventy six million,

00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:59.064
five hundred thirty seven thousand,
ninety one pesos and twenty nine cents.

00:14:59.973 --> 00:15:00.973
number…

00:15:01.423 --> 00:15:02.508
Thirty seven!

00:15:05.709 --> 00:15:08.212
Just one number and
they still didn’t give it!

00:15:10.541 --> 00:15:12.877
It’s okay.
We still won something.

00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:16.582
We can start paying off our debts.

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:19.418
And you're close to graduating too.

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:23.589
I know you’ll land
a good job.

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:26.925
We’ll be able to pay
off everything we owe.

00:15:27.384 --> 00:15:28.677
You’re my only hope.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:30.910
Of course, Ma.

00:15:31.304 --> 00:15:33.264
My grades at school are doing well.

00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:37.102
But there’s this new student
trying to steal my scholarship.

00:15:38.599 --> 00:15:39.580
That’s okay, son.

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:42.149
Just don’t ever neglect your studies,

00:15:42.149 --> 00:15:45.069
just like how you never forget
my lotto numbers.

00:15:45.986 --> 00:15:47.988
There it is, Ma!

00:15:48.013 --> 00:15:50.674
You care more about the lotto
than buying your meds.

00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:52.368
You talk too much!

00:15:57.289 --> 00:15:58.289
Hey!

00:16:01.168 --> 00:16:02.168
Oops!

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:03.754
Sorry, Banky.

00:16:03.936 --> 00:16:05.331
Did not see you there.

00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:08.801
Maybe your vision’s going blurry.

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.177
Why don’t you
get your eyes checked?

00:16:10.202 --> 00:16:11.787
You're the one in the way.

00:16:11.812 --> 00:16:13.605
You go get your eyes checked.

00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:20.728
What?

00:16:22.272 --> 00:16:23.816
Pick up my stuff, please.

00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:25.943
Why would I do that?

00:16:29.634 --> 00:16:31.344
Newton’s Third Law of Motion.

00:16:31.995 --> 00:16:35.165
For every action, there’s an equal
and opposite reaction.

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:38.956
What's your point, Einstein?

00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:43.126
Here’s how it works.

00:16:43.411 --> 00:16:44.537
Listen up.

00:16:45.266 --> 00:16:47.310
So in your case,
you created an action.

00:16:47.826 --> 00:16:49.703
And there’s an equal and opposite reaction.

00:16:49.728 --> 00:16:50.818
And my reaction is,

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:53.637
I’m politely asking you
to pick up my stuff.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:58.048
In layman’s term:
your mess, your cleanup.

00:16:58.719 --> 00:16:59.720
And if you still don’t get that,

00:16:59.745 --> 00:17:02.059
then I don’t know,
you must just be plain dumb.

00:17:05.649 --> 00:17:06.900
Who the fuck are you

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.069
to order me around
and call me dumb, huh?

00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:10.070
As a matter of fact,

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.563
why don’t you grab
my shirt and do the laundry,

00:17:11.588 --> 00:17:12.881
you fucking bitch.

00:17:13.274 --> 00:17:14.274
Why don’t you do it yourself?

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.200
You're embarrassed?

00:17:16.698 --> 00:17:17.698
Aren’t you supposed to be cool?

00:17:18.011 --> 00:17:18.762
You think you’re tough?

00:17:18.787 --> 00:17:19.329
You wanna fight?

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.379
Chill!

00:17:20.404 --> 00:17:21.014
Come on.

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:21.890
Calm down.

00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:22.916
I don’t get it.

00:17:24.057 --> 00:17:25.965
Why does it always
have to end in a fight?

00:17:27.254 --> 00:17:28.672
Is that all that goes on in your head?

00:17:28.672 --> 00:17:30.799
One more word,
you’re gonna fucking get it, bitch.

00:17:30.914 --> 00:17:31.692
Let’s go.

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:32.443
Come on!

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:33.510
- Let’s go.
- Hit me!

00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:34.903
Hit me!

00:17:34.928 --> 00:17:35.904
Let’s go.

00:17:35.929 --> 00:17:37.082
Hit me!

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.285
Go.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.168
Good morning, ma’am.

00:18:06.195 --> 00:18:07.238
Oh, good morning.

00:18:07.473 --> 00:18:08.474
Good morning, Ms. Perez.

00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:11.832
This month,
Possenti has been chosen

00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:15.719
to represent the Teen Genius Quiz.

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.806
It’s exciting because that also means

00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:21.475
two of our students get to
participate and compete.

00:18:24.394 --> 00:18:27.022
And I want both of you to join.

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:30.692
I actually want
both of you to be teammates.

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.110
I want you both to work

00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:34.738
very hard alongside each other.

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:39.952
Sorry, Ms. Perez, but I might
have to pass this time.

00:18:41.174 --> 00:18:43.092
Exams are coming up.

00:18:43.603 --> 00:18:45.981
I’d rather focus
on reviewing for now.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.518
I can’t risk losing
my scholarship.

00:18:49.894 --> 00:18:51.521
Bank, that's too bad.

00:18:52.794 --> 00:18:54.212
With all your efforts?

00:18:56.873 --> 00:18:57.803
Let’s do this instead.

00:18:57.803 --> 00:19:00.889
Since you mentioned the scholarship,
how about this?

00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:06.115
Let’s use the quiz results
as the basis.

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:09.372
For who gets the full scholarship
next semester.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.443
What do you mean by that?

00:19:13.468 --> 00:19:15.095
If it were just up to me,

00:19:18.628 --> 00:19:20.129
I’d choose both of you.

00:19:21.096 --> 00:19:22.807
But the school has a tight budget

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.021
per year.

00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:27.458
So, I need you guys to compete
against each other.

00:19:27.483 --> 00:19:30.361
And whoever scores the highest,

00:19:31.065 --> 00:19:35.194
will receive the
full scholarship next sem.

00:19:36.043 --> 00:19:37.294
What do you guys think?

00:19:42.457 --> 00:19:43.750
Don Juan!

00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:47.978
Slayer of the seven-headed dragon!

00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:50.439
Seven-headed dragon!

00:19:51.217 --> 00:19:52.426
Ugh, serpent!

00:19:54.192 --> 00:19:55.777
You got this, Grace.

00:19:55.777 --> 00:19:58.572
You still have time
to memorize your lines.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.079
To be honest, I am nervous.

00:20:08.612 --> 00:20:10.155
But I am more excited.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.059
Oh, by the way,

00:20:12.518 --> 00:20:14.269
I heard about your new quiz show.

00:20:15.111 --> 00:20:17.030
You’re amazing, Sissy.

00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:18.258
You know what,

00:20:18.258 --> 00:20:21.136
I already thought of a new makeup look
that I want to do on you.

00:20:21.847 --> 00:20:23.849
It’s, um, it’s light,

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:25.432
but fresh.

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.392
No need for that, sis.

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:29.102
I’m good with a bare face.

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:30.687
But still, thanks.

00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:32.789
Okay.

00:20:32.814 --> 00:20:34.316
Oh, wait.

00:20:41.439 --> 00:20:42.447
Here.

00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:43.800
Wow.

00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:45.953
Wear this for luck.

00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:48.097
- And also think of this—yeah.
- Really?

00:20:48.379 --> 00:20:50.631
And think of this as a friendship charm.

00:20:50.656 --> 00:20:51.656
And look!

00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:53.306
I’m wearing mine too.

00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:55.253
Thank you, sis.

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:57.839
But just a reminder—

00:20:58.298 --> 00:21:00.175
Bank and I are both
in the quiz show, okay?

00:21:00.847 --> 00:21:01.847
It’s not just me.

00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:05.346
Uh.

00:21:06.028 --> 00:21:07.028
You know.

00:21:09.225 --> 00:21:12.436
I think you should
be careful with Bank.

00:21:13.357 --> 00:21:14.608
You can’t trust him.

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:17.234
Especially after what he did to Pat.

00:21:18.122 --> 00:21:19.207
What did he do?

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:23.365
Well, back in eighth grade,

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:26.201
he told the teacher that
Pat and his friends were cheating

00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:27.494
even though he didn’t have proof.

00:21:28.452 --> 00:21:30.454
And they almost got suspended for it.

00:21:31.018 --> 00:21:33.562
You know, I think he
did that to get back at Pat.

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:35.459
He’s…

00:21:35.906 --> 00:21:36.740
arrogant.

00:21:36.765 --> 00:21:37.765
And, um.

00:21:38.296 --> 00:21:39.298
What do you call it?

00:21:40.355 --> 00:21:41.355
Envious.

00:21:43.241 --> 00:21:44.326
I don’t know.

00:21:45.303 --> 00:21:47.723
I don’t think Bank
would do something like that.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.726
Maybe they really did cheat.

00:21:53.186 --> 00:21:54.438
Anyway, sis.

00:21:55.939 --> 00:21:57.816
I’m just looking out for you, okay?

00:21:58.525 --> 00:21:59.985
There’s something off about him.

00:22:00.944 --> 00:22:04.072
Welcome back to Teen Genius!

00:22:04.332 --> 00:22:07.627
Collegio de San Gabriel Possenti
dominated the last two categories.

00:22:07.652 --> 00:22:11.288
It’s down to a single-point lead
for Bayanihan Science High!

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:13.206
On to our next category!

00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:14.374
Math and Logic.

00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:18.754
What is the value of Pi
to twelve decimal places?

00:22:19.921 --> 00:22:21.548
Colegio de San Gabriel Possenti?

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.886
3.14159265358979.

00:22:28.771 --> 00:22:29.771
Correct!

00:22:29.796 --> 00:22:32.840
That evens the score between
Bayanihan Science High

00:22:32.865 --> 00:22:34.909
and Colegio de San Gabriel Possenti!

00:22:34.934 --> 00:22:37.020
They both have 24 points.

00:22:37.045 --> 00:22:39.922
The competition between our
two schools is so tight!

00:22:43.111 --> 00:22:44.111
Just stay calm.

00:22:44.654 --> 00:22:46.239
We’ve got this.

00:22:47.005 --> 00:22:48.005
For what?

00:22:48.468 --> 00:22:49.492
So you can answer first?

00:22:50.468 --> 00:22:51.369
No thanks.

00:22:51.369 --> 00:22:52.704
It all comes down to this.

00:22:52.881 --> 00:22:56.359
The final question that will
determine our Teen Genius Champion!

00:22:56.492 --> 00:22:58.619
Look at the picture on the screen.

00:23:02.427 --> 00:23:03.928
When the dice is spread out,

00:23:03.953 --> 00:23:06.748
which of the following diagrams
will you get?

00:23:09.158 --> 00:23:11.076
I’ll give you ten seconds to answer.

00:23:14.684 --> 00:23:15.727
The answer's D, right?

00:23:17.893 --> 00:23:20.563
Collegio de San Gabriel Possenti
seems to have their answer ready.

00:23:24.152 --> 00:23:26.696
So, I need you guys
to compete against each other.

00:23:26.696 --> 00:23:29.491
And whoever gets
the highest score,

00:23:29.866 --> 00:23:33.745
will receive the
full scholarship next semester.

00:23:33.995 --> 00:23:36.289
Lin already got 12 answers right.

00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:38.458
My school performance is doing okay.

00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:42.129
But there’s a new student
trying to take my scholarship.

00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:43.255
I also got 12.

00:23:43.966 --> 00:23:45.093
I can't mess this up.

00:23:45.752 --> 00:23:47.117
I have to think this through.

00:23:49.511 --> 00:23:50.846
Bank, come on.

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:54.349
No, I've got this.

00:23:59.688 --> 00:24:01.731
I'm sorry, I have to do this.

00:24:08.369 --> 00:24:10.037
Colegio de San Gabriel Possenti?

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:14.369
Letter D.

00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:17.997
Correct!

00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:19.695
We now have a winner!

00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:22.085
Colegio de San Gabriel Possenti!

00:24:24.024 --> 00:24:26.860
Congratulations, Linette Estrella
and Tristan Bangkat.

00:24:27.249 --> 00:24:29.918
I'm sure your school is
very proud of you.

00:24:40.478 --> 00:24:42.606
Congratulations to both of you.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.525
You made the school very, very proud.

00:24:46.703 --> 00:24:47.693
Lin.

00:24:47.718 --> 00:24:48.761
As promised…

00:24:49.096 --> 00:24:52.058
you got the highest score,

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.538
meaning you are getting
the scholarship next year.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.835
Congratulations.

00:24:58.181 --> 00:24:59.242
Thank you.

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:04.377
And as for you, Bank,
congratulations still,

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.495
you can still try again,

00:25:07.901 --> 00:25:09.653
next school year and keep going.

00:25:10.124 --> 00:25:11.124
It's a waste.

00:25:12.531 --> 00:25:13.678
Bank, keep fighting.

00:25:14.183 --> 00:25:15.413
Please don’t give up.

00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:17.849
and congratulations, still.

00:25:18.934 --> 00:25:19.934
Okay?

00:25:29.736 --> 00:25:31.321
Bank, Bank, wait.

00:25:31.321 --> 00:25:31.988
Can we talk, please?

00:25:31.988 --> 00:25:34.074
What do you want to talk about, Lin?

00:25:34.888 --> 00:25:36.515
You got the scholarship for next sem.

00:25:37.528 --> 00:25:38.528
Congrats!

00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:41.497
Are you mad?

00:25:42.968 --> 00:25:45.437
Why does it feel like
I did something wrong?

00:25:45.837 --> 00:25:47.672
Didn’t we both agree to this deal?

00:25:48.127 --> 00:25:49.127
Lin.

00:25:49.502 --> 00:25:51.254
What else do you want me to say?

00:25:52.175 --> 00:25:54.886
I'm so happy for you because
you got the scholarship and I didn’t.

00:25:55.524 --> 00:25:57.776
That you want me
to be okay with losing.

00:25:57.941 --> 00:25:59.400
So what?
So you won’t feel guilty?

00:26:00.915 --> 00:26:02.458
What do you want from me, Lin?

00:26:02.969 --> 00:26:03.877
You okay now?

00:26:03.902 --> 00:26:05.187
Yeah, I’m okay.

00:26:05.212 --> 00:26:06.213
Are you satisfied now?

00:26:07.217 --> 00:26:08.608
That’s not what I meant, Bank.

00:26:09.443 --> 00:26:10.502
Lin.

00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:11.920
Just admit it.

00:26:11.945 --> 00:26:13.363
You wanted to beat me too.

00:26:13.363 --> 00:26:15.240
You wanted to win for yourself.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.125
And there’s nothing wrong with that.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:18.943
Because honestly,
I wanted to beat you too.

00:26:20.067 --> 00:26:21.861
Unfortunately for me,
you're too good.

00:26:22.301 --> 00:26:23.346
It’s my fault.

00:26:23.672 --> 00:26:25.215
There didn’t have to be a loser.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.240
Lin.

00:26:26.334 --> 00:26:27.669
Open your eyes.

00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:31.715
We're rivals for the scholarship
until we graduate.

00:26:32.532 --> 00:26:34.372
So someone will win,
someone will lose.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.052
Deal with it.

00:26:36.803 --> 00:26:38.513
This is exactly what I meant—

00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:40.765
why I didn’t want
to be friends with you.

00:26:42.183 --> 00:26:43.435
Because if we’re not friends,

00:26:43.435 --> 00:26:45.186
only one of us gets hurt.

00:26:46.062 --> 00:26:48.273
But if we are, whoever wins,

00:26:49.107 --> 00:26:50.608
we both get hurt, Lin.

00:27:02.495 --> 00:27:04.039
311, Bangkat.

00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:07.751
312, Ferrer.

00:27:10.334 --> 00:27:11.313
Miss,

00:27:11.338 --> 00:27:13.965
can you put me first, please?

00:27:14.287 --> 00:27:17.165
I’m a senior and I’m sick.

00:27:17.547 --> 00:27:21.114
Ma’am, most people in this line
are seniors and sick.

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:22.557
Let’s just wait for our turn.

00:27:22.557 --> 00:27:23.849
Please don’t insist.

00:27:23.892 --> 00:27:25.185
Come on, Miss.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:26.253
Just me first.

00:27:26.728 --> 00:27:27.854
I said no, Ma’am.

00:27:27.854 --> 00:27:29.230
Please go back to your seat.

00:27:43.382 --> 00:27:44.383
Ma.

00:27:45.326 --> 00:27:48.079
Next time let’s just go to
a private hospital.

00:27:48.958 --> 00:27:51.002
Patients here are not treated well.

00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:54.172
Look, we’ve been
here for three hours.

00:27:54.408 --> 00:27:56.994
There’s not even a decent chair
for patients like you.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.511
This place will only
make you feel worse.

00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:00.720
What are you talking about?

00:28:00.835 --> 00:28:02.670
We can’t afford private care.

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.724
That’s just for one check-up.

00:28:04.724 --> 00:28:06.226
We’d go broke.

00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:07.482
I’m fine here.

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:09.162
I can endure this.

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.980
It’s better than spending too much.

00:28:11.936 --> 00:28:13.083
It may be free,

00:28:13.108 --> 00:28:14.859
but they’re making you suffer.

00:28:15.318 --> 00:28:16.569
They might hear you.

00:28:17.737 --> 00:28:18.737
Wait.

00:28:18.988 --> 00:28:20.382
Why are you still here?

00:28:20.407 --> 00:28:21.633
Don’t you have class?

00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:22.384
Go on.

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:22.909
You should leave now.

00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:24.119
I can handle this.

00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:25.216
Give me the number.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.996
I can manage alone.

00:28:27.437 --> 00:28:28.515
You might be late.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.041
Might ruin your record.

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:31.418
You're still on a scholarship.

00:28:38.331 --> 00:28:39.331
Uhh.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.260
Ma...

00:28:43.898 --> 00:28:46.192
I’m not a scholar anymore next sem.

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:50.812
They gave it to...

00:28:52.147 --> 00:28:53.815
someone better than me.

00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:56.401
So what, my child.

00:28:56.604 --> 00:28:58.115
Don’t worry about that yet.

00:28:59.529 --> 00:29:01.576
It’s still a while before
classes start again.

00:29:04.284 --> 00:29:06.578
We still have time to save up.

00:29:08.997 --> 00:29:10.790
Don’t stress yourself.

00:29:11.849 --> 00:29:13.042
I got this, okay?

00:29:33.855 --> 00:29:35.398
Hey, Teacher Lin.

00:29:37.817 --> 00:29:39.319
Congrats on the quiz show.

00:29:39.879 --> 00:29:42.089
You look great online,
you know?

00:29:42.947 --> 00:29:45.909
But of course,
you're way prettier in person.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:49.650
Anyways.

00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:53.082
I heard you got a full-ride
scholarship next semester.

00:29:54.083 --> 00:29:55.376
You beat Bank, huh?

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.128
I say, deserved.

00:29:57.962 --> 00:29:59.589
I don’t like that snitch anyway.

00:30:00.006 --> 00:30:01.549
Did you know he once
ratted us out to our prof?

00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:02.759
Said we were cheating.

00:30:03.092 --> 00:30:04.177
Grace told me, yes.

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:06.346
That’s why I can’t stand him.

00:30:07.514 --> 00:30:08.598
I’ll say it again.

00:30:08.932 --> 00:30:09.932
Deserved.

00:30:10.648 --> 00:30:13.428
So you called me here
to listen to your rant?

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:16.564
You’re such a grump, Lin.

00:30:17.565 --> 00:30:19.192
Well, actually,
I called you here because

00:30:19.192 --> 00:30:20.568
I’m planning for next sem.

00:30:21.236 --> 00:30:22.820
I need more time with Grace,

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:26.157
more travel dates with her,
more time for basketball.

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:28.576
And I can’t have that
if my grades are low.

00:30:30.578 --> 00:30:32.497
So I just wanna make sure—

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:37.126
You’ll let me copy
again next semester, right?

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.753
I don’t know.

00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:42.590
Got you there, Teacher Lin.

00:30:43.174 --> 00:30:44.259
Right,

00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:47.011
You're on a full-ride scholarship
next semester.

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:48.805
You don’t need
my money anymore

00:30:49.639 --> 00:30:51.891
- Look, I don't have time for this
- Wait.

00:30:51.891 --> 00:30:53.393
What do you want, Pat?

00:30:53.893 --> 00:30:55.728
I’m just messing with you.

00:30:57.175 --> 00:30:58.242
Okay, fine.

00:30:58.413 --> 00:30:59.499
You got me.

00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:00.554
You win.

00:31:01.538 --> 00:31:02.456
But do you know,

00:31:02.481 --> 00:31:04.525
all those computers…

00:31:05.488 --> 00:31:08.199
even the newly renovated library—

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.157
my dad donated all of that.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:14.032
Honestly, they should name
the whole building after me.

00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:19.669
And you— your name should be in
Ms. Perez’s office,

00:31:19.728 --> 00:31:20.771
on display.

00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:23.057
Never mind, scratch that.

00:31:23.798 --> 00:31:26.634
Better yet, in the
newly renovated library.

00:31:26.843 --> 00:31:30.847
You’ve made a pretty big contribution.

00:31:30.969 --> 00:31:32.062
Contribution?

00:31:32.223 --> 00:31:35.310
What’s that supposed to mean?
I’m a scholar.

00:31:35.602 --> 00:31:36.728
Exactly.

00:31:38.813 --> 00:31:40.356
That’s why I’m wondering.

00:31:40.523 --> 00:31:43.401
It made me think,
I thought you couldn’t afford it.

00:31:43.426 --> 00:31:44.444
There wasn’t any—

00:31:44.444 --> 00:31:48.239
my dad literally loaned
to pay half the tuition, because…

00:31:49.858 --> 00:31:50.898
Hold up,

00:31:51.868 --> 00:31:53.244
I don’t get it.

00:31:53.445 --> 00:31:54.529
Come on, Lin.

00:31:55.657 --> 00:31:56.908
Seriously,

00:31:58.007 --> 00:32:01.385
how did you get in
here so effortlessly?

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:06.090
You think you really got here
fair and square?

00:32:26.741 --> 00:32:27.741
Lin?

00:32:28.388 --> 00:32:29.388
Dad?

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:31.574
Can you please explain what this is?

00:32:33.117 --> 00:32:34.285
Wait, why—

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.722
Where did you get that?
Why do you have it?

00:32:37.747 --> 00:32:40.041
Why did you pay
for this miscellaneous fee?

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.781
It’s so expensive.

00:32:42.642 --> 00:32:44.687
What’s the point of a partial scholarship

00:32:44.712 --> 00:32:47.090
if we still paid like full tuition?

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:48.633
I don’t get it.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:50.078
Wait.

00:32:51.094 --> 00:32:52.679
That’s just a one-time fee.

00:32:52.704 --> 00:32:53.765
Like…

00:32:54.359 --> 00:32:57.112
Like it secures your spot until Grade 12.

00:32:58.935 --> 00:33:02.230
But I’m only studying
two years at Possenti.

00:33:03.064 --> 00:33:04.357
Why is it this much?

00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:07.443
What else aren’t you telling me?

00:33:10.939 --> 00:33:11.939
I’m your father.

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:16.119
It’s my right to make sure
of your future.

00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:19.330
You know, you’re so smart,

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.416
everything has to make sense to you.

00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:23.626
I get it. I really do.

00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:24.797
But please,

00:33:25.044 --> 00:33:27.046
don’t overthink everything.

00:33:27.046 --> 00:33:28.464
Let me handle this.

00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:30.591
But Dad,

00:33:31.149 --> 00:33:33.151
I’m thinking about you too.

00:33:35.268 --> 00:33:36.937
They took advantage

00:33:36.962 --> 00:33:39.548
of how desperate you were
just to get me into Possenti.

00:33:39.608 --> 00:33:41.510
- Why did you agree?
- Lin!

00:33:43.468 --> 00:33:44.564
I’m your father!

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:47.524
Can you just—

00:33:48.609 --> 00:33:50.570
let me handle things my way?

00:33:52.728 --> 00:33:54.304
Can you at least respect that?

00:33:56.365 --> 00:33:58.116
Let me deal with this on my own.

00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:01.497
This is what I want to do.

00:34:01.497 --> 00:34:02.540
It’s the only thing I can give you.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.624
I don’t want your mom thinking

00:34:03.624 --> 00:34:05.209
I couldn’t give you
a good future.

00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:07.545
And I don’t want you
thinking that either.

00:34:12.823 --> 00:34:15.326
All I’m asking from you
is to study well.

00:34:22.512 --> 00:34:24.139
Just go back to your room.

00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:09.690
Come on, Lin.

00:35:10.149 --> 00:35:13.778
How did you get in here so effortlessly?

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:18.324
You really think you
got in fair and square?

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:31.062
Lin.

00:35:31.087 --> 00:35:33.881
...meaning you are getting
the scholarship next year.

00:35:35.606 --> 00:35:36.606
Lin.

00:35:36.918 --> 00:35:38.169
open your eyes.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:42.431
We’re rivals for the scholarship
until we graduate.

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:45.101
So someone will win, someone will lose.

00:35:45.685 --> 00:35:46.685
Deal with it.

00:35:51.641 --> 00:35:53.351
Let’s help each other out, Lin.

00:35:53.682 --> 00:35:54.708
Name your price.

00:36:00.965 --> 00:36:01.965
Dad.

00:36:02.493 --> 00:36:04.370
can you please explain what this is?

00:36:25.978 --> 00:36:26.978
You’re right.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.313
If the school’s profiting off of us,

00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:33.232
we might as well
profit from them too.

00:36:35.454 --> 00:36:36.544
Guys,

00:36:36.569 --> 00:36:37.569
this is Lin.

00:36:37.987 --> 00:36:38.987
Lin,

00:36:39.012 --> 00:36:40.339
meet our first client.

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:41.365
This is DJ Ping.

00:36:41.741 --> 00:36:42.800
My best friend.

00:36:42.825 --> 00:36:44.760
- He’s in AV Club.
- Hey, Lin.

00:36:44.785 --> 00:36:45.884
Just call me Peter.

00:36:46.913 --> 00:36:47.997
That’s Thirdy.

00:36:48.456 --> 00:36:49.916
Basketball player like me

00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:51.334
And this guy is Tony.

00:36:52.168 --> 00:36:53.711
Don’t even know why he’s here.

00:36:54.587 --> 00:36:55.438
Hon,

00:36:55.463 --> 00:36:56.547
you’re too much.

00:36:56.572 --> 00:36:58.574
He’s our drama club photographer.

00:36:59.753 --> 00:37:01.255
Alright, here’s the deal.

00:37:01.534 --> 00:37:05.476
This semester, my fee is
20 thousand per person.

00:37:05.501 --> 00:37:09.310
That covers all types
of exams and subjects,

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.561
except for PE.

00:37:10.586 --> 00:37:12.313
All payments must be in cash.

00:37:12.338 --> 00:37:14.924
I don’t want any transaction records.

00:37:15.016 --> 00:37:16.048
Too risky.

00:37:16.272 --> 00:37:19.066
So give your payments to Pat only.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.988
So that’s 80 thousand total.

00:37:21.013 --> 00:37:22.598
Your deadline’s on Friday.

00:37:23.918 --> 00:37:25.711
You're free Sis since you're
my bestfriend.

00:37:25.824 --> 00:37:27.102
Oh, really, sis?

00:37:27.526 --> 00:37:29.111
You didn’t have to, but thanks.

00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:34.532
Please be reminded,
this is strictly confidential.

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:36.963
That means no one
can know about this

00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:38.852
except the six of us here.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.969
No one else knows,
not even friends or loved ones.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.720
If anyone violates this,

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.719
you’re automatically kicked out
of the group and the deal.

00:37:48.049 --> 00:37:49.148
Deal?

00:37:51.458 --> 00:37:53.375
How will you give us the answers?

00:37:53.728 --> 00:37:55.856
will you hand out
your magic erasers again?

00:37:56.732 --> 00:37:58.067
This is the new method.

00:37:58.833 --> 00:38:00.459
I will use four compositions...

00:38:00.843 --> 00:38:05.320
that will represent A, B, C and D.

00:38:05.366 --> 00:38:07.398
Watch the finger movements closely.

00:38:11.692 --> 00:38:12.735
That’s A.

00:38:13.163 --> 00:38:15.248
Pinky finger first,
then thumb at the end.

00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:18.796
That’s B.

00:38:19.505 --> 00:38:20.840
Repeat the motion twice.

00:38:26.282 --> 00:38:27.492
That’s C.

00:38:27.769 --> 00:38:30.939
Remember: two, three, two, four, four.

00:38:35.247 --> 00:38:36.594
That’s D.

00:38:37.023 --> 00:38:38.742
Easiest one of all.

00:38:38.951 --> 00:38:40.160
What's so easy about it?

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:42.319
At first, it’s hard.

00:38:43.026 --> 00:38:45.737
But after a bit of practice,
you’ll get it.

00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:48.249
Eventually?

00:38:48.451 --> 00:38:49.702
It’s too confusing.

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:53.330
What if you just whistle
or cough instead?

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:54.331
Are you serious, bro?

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:58.127
There are so many questions—
you want Lin to keep coughing?

00:38:58.152 --> 00:38:59.219
You okay?

00:39:00.118 --> 00:39:03.121
Guys, let’s just calm down, okay?

00:39:03.632 --> 00:39:05.176
We’re all scared of getting caught.

00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:06.761
Let’s at least try this first.

00:39:07.636 --> 00:39:08.888
Easy for you to say.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.265
Can you even tell the chords apart?

00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:12.808
Did you even get everything?

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.108
Can you chill?

00:39:14.439 --> 00:39:17.025
Reminder—you're talking
to my girlfriend in front of me.

00:39:17.516 --> 00:39:18.546
I’m just asking.

00:39:18.571 --> 00:39:19.165
Bro.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.210
Cut it out.

00:39:20.589 --> 00:39:22.341
I’ll think of another method.

00:39:22.442 --> 00:39:24.179
Just don’t start a fight.

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:26.769
I’ll get it to you by Monday.

00:39:26.794 --> 00:39:27.920
I got this.

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:55.311
If I go fast, it’s too hard to follow.

00:40:20.334 --> 00:40:21.961
If I slow down,

00:40:23.129 --> 00:40:24.463
still hard to follow.

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.181
Ah, class,

00:41:15.764 --> 00:41:18.058
Tristan didn’t get to take the exam earlier

00:41:18.058 --> 00:41:20.394
because he had to rush
his mom to the hospital.

00:41:20.662 --> 00:41:23.915
So he’ll be taking it with your section.

00:41:26.942 --> 00:41:28.194
Tristan,

00:41:28.194 --> 00:41:30.237
go sit beside Lin.

00:41:30.718 --> 00:41:31.755
Miyuki,

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.741
can you move to the last row for now?

00:41:50.497 --> 00:41:53.135
The exam will begin at exactly 1:00 PM.

00:41:53.617 --> 00:41:56.620
Anyone I catch cheating

00:41:57.066 --> 00:41:59.151
automatically fails my subject.

00:42:00.173 --> 00:42:01.310
Understood?

00:42:01.838 --> 00:42:03.131
Yes, ma’am.

00:42:16.546 --> 00:42:18.047
You may start now.

00:43:35.321 --> 00:43:37.364
Okay, here’s what I thought of

00:43:37.627 --> 00:43:39.254
to send you the answers.

00:43:39.783 --> 00:43:41.702
I’ll use the classroom clock.

00:43:42.418 --> 00:43:44.420
The minute hand
will guide the questions.

00:43:44.913 --> 00:43:45.930
Each tick,

00:43:45.955 --> 00:43:47.290
we move to the next question.

00:43:47.853 --> 00:43:49.063
Where the hand points,

00:43:49.088 --> 00:43:50.279
that’s the question number.

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:52.288
If it’s at one minute,

00:43:52.313 --> 00:43:54.148
that’s question one.

00:43:54.173 --> 00:43:55.799
If it hits two,

00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:56.925
question two,

00:43:56.925 --> 00:43:57.968
and so on.

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:00.429
The exam has a total of 60 questions,

00:44:00.429 --> 00:44:02.239
so one hour is perfect.

00:44:02.264 --> 00:44:03.557
How will we know the answers?

00:44:03.557 --> 00:44:04.933
I’m getting to that.

00:44:06.325 --> 00:44:08.020
I’ll use one,

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:08.620
two,

00:44:08.645 --> 00:44:09.063
three,

00:44:09.063 --> 00:44:10.107
and four.

00:44:10.272 --> 00:44:12.208
Those will represent the letters.

00:44:12.566 --> 00:44:14.109
Just look at my right hand.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.236
I’ll move it in sync

00:44:16.236 --> 00:44:18.155
with the second hand of the clock.

00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:19.763
One is A.

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:29.833
Two is B.

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:42.922
Three is C.

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:52.523
And four is D.

00:45:13.168 --> 00:45:14.211
You guys get it?

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:15.921
No violent reactions from us,

00:45:16.145 --> 00:45:17.187
"best friend", Lin.

00:45:18.674 --> 00:45:19.842
Just a reminder, guys,

00:45:20.182 --> 00:45:22.184
I'll give you all the right answers,

00:45:22.209 --> 00:45:23.919
but for every four questions,

00:45:23.944 --> 00:45:25.732
change the answer on the fifth.

00:45:25.973 --> 00:45:27.766
That way we avoid any patterns

00:45:27.766 --> 00:45:28.990
in our answers,

00:45:29.241 --> 00:45:30.534
so we don't get caught.

00:45:45.784 --> 00:45:46.994
What are you doing?

00:45:54.793 --> 00:45:56.003
You're being too fidgety.

00:46:02.316 --> 00:46:02.983
What?

00:46:03.008 --> 00:46:04.815
What are you guys talking about?

00:46:11.925 --> 00:46:13.385
What fell, Tristan?

00:46:15.545 --> 00:46:16.643
Tristan,

00:46:16.736 --> 00:46:18.409
what's that paper you're holding?

00:46:18.996 --> 00:46:19.996
Is that a cheat sheet?

00:46:21.004 --> 00:46:22.004
Give it to me.

00:46:23.852 --> 00:46:25.260
This isn’t a cheat sheet, ma’am.

00:46:25.657 --> 00:46:27.201
Then hand it over.

00:46:29.419 --> 00:46:30.587
Hand it over, Tristan.

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:34.540
One.

00:46:36.877 --> 00:46:37.877
Two.

00:46:39.797 --> 00:46:40.839
You're really not giving it?

00:46:40.839 --> 00:46:42.090
I said hand it over.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.367
Ma’am!

00:46:45.523 --> 00:46:46.523
What's this?

00:46:56.483 --> 00:46:57.695
Tristan.

00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.156
What’s that paper you're holding?

00:46:59.181 --> 00:47:00.492
Is that a cheat sheet?

00:47:01.276 --> 00:47:02.444
Good morning, ma'am.

00:47:02.469 --> 00:47:03.469
Bank.

00:47:04.238 --> 00:47:05.447
Can I talk to you?

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:06.703
Congrats, Hon!

00:47:06.728 --> 00:47:08.105
Can I get a fan sign?

00:47:08.235 --> 00:47:09.820
Forget about that Claire.

00:47:10.139 --> 00:47:11.557
she's just overrated.

00:47:12.255 --> 00:47:14.216
You’re way better than her,
for sure.

00:47:14.868 --> 00:47:16.703
Attention, Grade 11 students.

00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:20.196
You will begin your Midterm exams.

00:47:20.795 --> 00:47:21.921
No talking...

00:47:22.756 --> 00:47:24.800
and absolutely,

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.301
no cheating.

00:47:27.219 --> 00:47:28.220
Excuse me.

00:47:28.804 --> 00:47:29.804
Bank.

00:47:30.019 --> 00:47:31.729
You better just come clean.

00:47:31.754 --> 00:47:34.090
Did you give
the answers to Kyle?

00:47:34.752 --> 00:47:35.836
What?

00:47:37.276 --> 00:47:38.903
I just want to know,

00:47:39.351 --> 00:47:40.398
why did you do it?
