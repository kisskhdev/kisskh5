This is the only route back
from the welfare store.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.010
Have you decided how to confess?

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.420
I'll stop him

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.700
and invite him to the gaming expo.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.890
I'll find a chance to confess by then.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.380
He's coming. He's coming.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.830
If you take another step,

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.360
I'll lose my chance at love.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.220
In high school,

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.750
you confessed to me.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.620
It was all fake.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.950
Tian Xinhui, shut up.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:02.860
Why are you being so harsh?

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.530
What's with that attitude?

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.300
You owe me this.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.660
I wanted to confess to Junxi,

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.380
but you got in my way

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.190
and said you wanted to date me.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.480
You didn't even like me!

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.530
You just didn't want

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.060
me to pursue Junxi.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.020
You jerk!

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.270
Don't tell me

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.020
all of Tuo's ex-girlfriends

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.930
liked Junxi first.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:39.820
Tuo.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:41.760
Is that true?

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.580
Tuo!

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.850
[Matsutaka]

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:57.800
Han Tuo!

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.010
[In the Next Episode]

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.330
Tuo also received an interview notice
from Zhan Wensen.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.190
Looking forward to your joining.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:17.940
You're up early.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.260
Han Tuo.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.900
Who's this?

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.630
I saw a pair of shoes at the entrance
which I have never seen before.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.270
Did you have a friend staying over?
