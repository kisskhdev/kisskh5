(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

2
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,840
(Episode 23, I Only Want You)

3
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
We got it.

4
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,880
They say the mastermind
is someone named Wang Zhen Long.

5
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
Do you know him?

6
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,040
We're even discussing marriage.

7
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,840
Wang Zhen Long, what are you doing?

8
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
Yue Yue.

9
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,680
Wang Zhen Long!

10
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,920
Seriously.

11
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,080
I know him.

12
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,200
I know him so well.

13
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
I didn't expect...

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,880
that he still won't spare me
after so long.

15
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,960
Where is he now?

16
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,256
In the abandoned warehouse
on the west side of the city.

17
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,120
Give me his phone number.
I'll pay him a visit.

18
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,840
Da Wei!

19
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
Let him go.

20
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Wang Zhen Long!

21
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,440
- You're here.
- Cut the crap!

22
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,880
Did you falsify the accounts?

23
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,000
Isn't this the famous...

24
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,920
Wu Qi Qiong?

25
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,399
When Lin Yan Rui told me...

26
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,960
about you and Chi Cheng,

27
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,400
I didn't believe him.

28
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,160
For such a small amount of money,

29
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,960
you and your love rival...

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,040
got together?

31
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,760
I didn't expect...

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,360
that my two bricks...

33
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,720
didn't knock you stupid.

34
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,400
Instead, it changed
your sexual preference.

35
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,440
How does it feel
to let your love rival...

36
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,520
sleep with you?

37
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
By the way,

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,280
I really want to know.

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,560
You,

40
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Yue Yue,

41
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
and Chi Cheng.

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,759
Did the three of you...

43
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,199
Come at me if you're mad.

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,600
Why drag Chi Cheng into this?

45
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,760
Drag?

46
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,319
What benefit...

47
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,280
did Chi Cheng give you?

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,080
How nice...

49
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,760
did he make you feel?

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,080
You even used...

51
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,560
the word "drag".

52
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,599
Coward!

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,839
You only dare to play dirty
to frame Chi Cheng.

54
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,200
Can't you be a man?

55
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,920
If it weren't for him,

56
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,999
my leg...

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,200
wouldn't be crippled!

58
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,879
You had an accident
after driving drunk.

59
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,200
Who can you blame?

60
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,640
Report it to the police!

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,760
Go to the court
and let the police check.

62
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,320
I've called the police.

63
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,360
It's such a big falsified account,

64
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,400
enough for Chi Cheng...

65
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,800
to suffer.

66
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,720
How much money do you want?

67
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
Name your price.

68
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,736
I'll pay you even if I must sell
everything I have.

69
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,040
Just please spare Chi Cheng.

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,800
The cheapskate...

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,440
is finally willing to spend money.

72
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,400
No one begs like this.

73
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,880
Let me tell you.

74
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,160
I don't want money.

75
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,440
I want Chi Cheng...

76
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,639
to be in jail for three
to five years...

77
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,040
to pay for my leg.

78
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
What are you doing?

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,080
I'm begging you.

80
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
What did you say?

81
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,680
I can't hear you.

82
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
I...

83
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,360
I'm begging you.

84
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Let me tell you.

85
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,040
Do you think your knee
is so precious?

86
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,160
At least...

87
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
you can still walk,

88
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,240
run,

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,080
and kneel.

90
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,359
I can only...

91
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,640
use this crutch
for the rest of my life!

92
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,880
What took you so long?

93
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Did Wang Zhen Long
do anything to you?

94
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
No.

95
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,880
I'm fine, aren't I?

96
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
It's closed down?

97
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,280
What about the exhibit hall?

98
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,720
It's temporarily closed too.

99
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,080
What are you planning to do...

100
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,480
from now on?

101
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,200
Start over.

102
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,240
Go back
and continue selling sugar figures.

103
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Has he eaten?

104
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
I don't know.

105
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,960
Is there any food?

106
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm hungry. I haven't eaten all day.

107
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
Okay.

108
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:26,119
I'll make you some supper.

109
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
Okay.

110
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,000
You're still in the mood
to watch TV?

111
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,600
Chi Cheng is so unlucky
to have a dad like you.

112
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,000
Just think as if he's at his home.

113
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,800
He usually doesn't come home
for three to five months, right?

114
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,280
It's not the same.

115
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,920
I know very well
what his usual condition is.

116
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,960
Now that he's locked up,

117
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,160
I don't even know if he's suffering.

118
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,120
He should suffer.

119
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,960
Otherwise, he won't even remember
his surname anymore.

120
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,279
Why are you still mad at him?

121
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,960
He's your only son.

122
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,359
Are you really
not going to do anything...

123
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,520
and let him go to jail?

124
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,480
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Chi.

125
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
I'm Wu Suo Wei.

126
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm here to visit you.

127
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,680
You're Wu Suo Wei?

128
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,360
How dare you come here?

129
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,679
You tricked my son
into opening a company with you.

130
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,000
You even made him a legal person.

131
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
Did you plan this from the start?

132
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,120
In the end,
you let him take the blame.

133
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,680
Ever since Chi Cheng was a kid,
he had never lacked anything.

134
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,520
He wouldn't risk anything
for such a small advantage.

135
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
Chi Cheng...

136
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,400
did get into trouble because
he opened a company with me.

137
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,240
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,760
But I never meant for Chi Cheng
to take the blame.

139
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,200
If possible,

140
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,840
I'm willing to be locked up...

141
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,200
in Chi Cheng's place.

142
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,160
What's the point of apologizing now?

143
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,240
If he's convicted,

144
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,920
Chi Cheng...

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,120
will never amount
to anything in this lifetime.

146
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,560
I hope you two...

147
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,880
can give me a chance
to redeem myself.

148
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,120
What can you do?

149
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,720
Just don't get in the way.

150
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,360
No matter what I must do,

151
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,720
I'll get Chi Cheng out in one piece.

152
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Here, Dou Dou.

153
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,759
- Eat this.
- I don't want it.

154
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,440
Come on, be good. Eat it.

155
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,760
Jia Li, let me ask you.

156
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,840
Is Wu Suo Wei...

157
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Is he?

158
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,559
Aunt Wu Suo Wei.

159
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,120
Is Aunt here?

160
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Dou Dou.

161
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,160
I'll take you
to fight monsters, okay?

162
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,480
- Let's go.
- No, I want to play with Aunt.

163
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,560
He's already calling him "Aunt".

164
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,640
Mom, take it easy.

165
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,319
Your son likes men.

166
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,640
I don't think he'll ever change.

167
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,120
Does your dad know?

168
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,760
He found out before you did.

169
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,040
Mom, have a seat.

170
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Here.

171
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,040
- Have some water.
- That isn't right.

172
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,999
The Chi family
won't have any descendants.

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,879
Mom, what era are we in?

174
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,000
You're still talking
about continuing the family line?

175
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,640
Chi Cheng himself
wanted to be the legal person.

176
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,199
I heard from Cheng Yu...

177
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,199
that this guy has been
running around for Chi Cheng.

178
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,480
He's putting in a lot of effort.

179
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,280
Hey, handsome.

180
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Wang Zhen.

181
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,920
I have great news.

182
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,080
What is it?

183
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,240
Chi Cheng has been arrested.

184
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,040
Are you busy these days?

185
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,200
- Yes.
- Let's go back with me.

186
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,879
It's so lively there.

187
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,960
How can I not watch?

188
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,719
Go home and pack now.

189
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
Come on. Let's go.

190
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,439
Hurry up.

191
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,560
If we don't go back now,
Chi Cheng will be released.

192
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,760
How are we going to go
and laugh at them then?

193
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
Okay.

194
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,080
Since Chi Cheng is locked up,

195
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,240
Big-Eyed Wu...

196
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,720
will have no one to back him up.

197
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,240
I have to take this chance...

198
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,440
to go back and bully him.

199
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,800
You're freaking crazy.

200
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,536
I've been asking you to go
for so long, but you wouldn't budge.

201
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,679
After I mentioned Wu Suo Wei,
you're energized, right?

202
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,719
Come on.

203
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,880
Let's go back to the country.

204
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,999
We'll go back to the country.
Let's go.

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,679
I really think
there's something wrong with you.

206
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,319
- Right.
- You took what I said as nonsense.

207
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Let's go back.

208
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Do you want this?

209
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:24,599
- Mom, I want a sugar figure.
- Hi.

210
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,359
- I'd like one of these.
- Okay.

211
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Here.

212
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Thank you.

213
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,639
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

214
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,960
Have a look at the sugar figures.

215
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,960
- Sugar figures.
- Which one would you like?

216
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,280
- Okay.
- I'll take a piglet.

217
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Here you go.

218
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,799
(Blowing Sugar Figures)

219
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,840
Hello.

220
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,136
- Let me see this one.
- Okay. Which one would you like?

221
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,240
Forget it. I don't want it.

222
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,800
(Blowing Sugar Figures)

223
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,080
Aren't you...

224
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,720
Who is it again?

225
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,879
Mr. Wu?

226
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,039
I haven't seen you in months.

227
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,480
Why did you change careers?
Are you blowing sugar figures now?

228
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,680
Do you still remember?

229
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,119
When I went to your company,
you told me...

230
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,480
to pick anything and guarantee
that I'd be satisfied.

231
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,920
Where's your backer?

232
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,080
The one who was willing...

233
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,559
to give up the breeding business...

234
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,240
and go into the business world
for you, Mr. Chi?

235
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,040
I just called him.

236
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,400
He didn't answer.

237
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Is he...

238
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,880
You're not
your parents' biological son.

239
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,360
He said I'm not
our parents' biological son.

240
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,760
You're not.

241
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,520
How many times have I told you?

242
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,680
Wasn't that a joke?

243
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,560
Then take it that I was joking.

244
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,879
Who are you to say
I'm not their biological son?

245
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,480
Take a look at yourself
and your brother.

246
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,960
Do you resemble each other?

247
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,799
When you go out on the street,
find anyone to judge...

248
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,920
whether the two of you look
like real brothers or not.

249
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
What are you laughing at?

250
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
Do you want me to put
the sugar basin on your head?

251
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Let's go.

252
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,160
We just got back.
He's still jet-lagged.

253
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
We'll get going.

254
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,680
You said
I'm not their biological son.

255
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,520
You're siding with outsiders again.

256
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
I'm home.

257
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,040
Things seem to have gone well today.

258
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,120
Yes, and no.

259
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
What's wrong?

260
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,000
I made over 1,000 yuan.

261
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,360
I even ran into my idol...

262
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,480
and...

263
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,560
my former love rival.

264
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,600
You mean Wang Zhen and Wang Shuo?

265
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,560
Why are they back?

266
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,400
Since Chi Cheng is in trouble,

267
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,240
they probably came back
to laugh at him.

268
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,519
If you say Wang Shuo came back
to laugh at him, I'll believe that.

269
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,360
But Wang Zhen definitely
isn't back to do that.

270
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,840
Do you have cash?

271
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
What's the matter?

272
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,800
I'll ask someone
to deliver some to Chi Cheng.

273
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,456
There's a supermarket
in the detention center.

274
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,600
They only accept cash.

275
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,040
And he can buy what he wants.

276
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,280
It's in the drawer.
Take it yourself.

277
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Thank you.

278
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,119
Look at you.

279
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,359
When he was around,

280
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,040
you only gave him 10 yuan
for allowance.

281
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,320
Now that he's gone,

282
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,920
you're so generous.

283
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,040
When he comes out,
I'll have to rely on him.

284
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,320
I think you shouldn't
take the bills.

285
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,440
You should take this bag...

286
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,640
and fill it with change.

287
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
Let him think...

288
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:54,319
that you had a hard time
earning this...

289
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
little by little.

290
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
By the way, Da Wei,

291
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:01,816
are you still going to wait and see
if Lin Yan Rui shows up tomorrow?

292
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Yes.

293
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,479
- Give me one too.
- Hello. What would you like?

294
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
Here's the money.

295
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,000
- Hello.
- I want two.

296
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
I'll take this.

297
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,480
Here's the money.

298
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Thank you.

299
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,520
- Sir, give me a sugar figure.
- Okay.

300
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,239
- Here.
- Here's the payment.

301
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,280
Thank you.

302
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,640
I'm so sleepy.

303
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,280
Young man, why are you still here?

304
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,840
It's already midnight.

305
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,120
I'll leave after selling these.

306
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,120
These are all
school district properties.

307
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,200
The kids have school tomorrow.

308
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,080
At this hour,
there's definitely no one around.

309
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,240
Not necessarily. Look, there's one.

310
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,280
How strange.

311
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Lin Yan Rui!

312
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
Don't run!

313
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,239
- Run if you dare!
- I'll stay put.

314
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,040
- Why aren't you running anymore?
- I'm sorry!

315
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,280
I won't run anymore!

316
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm not running anymore.
I... I won't run anymore.

317
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
I'm sorry.

318
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Darn you!

319
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Tell me.

320
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
How much did Wang Zhen Long pay you?

321
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,280
Who's Wang Zhen Long?

322
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
I don't know him.

323
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,920
If you don't tell me,

324
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,760
you're not leaving tonight.

325
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,640
Lately, my hands
have been a bit rusty.

326
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,679
I'll tell you.

327
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
I'll tell you.

328
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Mr. Wu.

329
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,720
I'm sorry.

330
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,280
My grandma has cancer.

331
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,800
She's in excruciating pain
every day.

332
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,520
She's undergoing chemotherapy...

333
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,760
and taking oral medicines.

334
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,760
The best imported medicines
cost over 10,000 yuan per bottle.

335
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,520
My grandma raised me
since I was little.

336
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,880
I can't just watch
my grandma in pain in front of me.

337
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,640
Then Wang Zhen Long came to me.

338
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,479
He told me
to falsify the accounts...

339
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,320
according to what his company's
Finance Department gives.

340
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
He promised to give me
one million yuan afterwards.

341
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,640
With that money,

342
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,560
I can get my grandma
the best medicine.

343
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,720
But after doing my best
to help him...

344
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,640
and let Chi Cheng...

345
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,520
I mean,
after letting Mr. Chi go to jail,

346
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,280
he refused to pay the balance.

347
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,640
I don't believe you.

348
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
It's true.

349
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,360
I have proof.

350
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Look.

351
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
(Wang Zhen Long)

352
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:24,159
(Zheng Long, I got Chi Cheng
into prison, can you pay me now?)

353
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,679
(My grandma's illness can't wait.
The hospital urged us many times.)

354
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,696
(What about the balance?
It's urgent! Mr. Wang, please.)

355
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,200
I asked him for it in person.

356
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,040
I said if he doesn't give me
the money,

357
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,760
I'll expose this.

358
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,880
He said if this gets out,

359
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,640
both of us will be in trouble.

360
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,680
He's a jerk!

361
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,520
How's your grandma now?

362
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,240
Not good.

363
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Don't worry.

364
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,480
I have a friend who introduced me
to a cancer specialist.

365
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,720
I can ask him for you.

366
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,680
Maybe your grandma
can still be saved.

367
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Tell me.

368
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,560
How much will you pay?

369
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,960
You're so good to me.

370
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,800
You treated my wounds...

371
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,200
and you're getting me a specialist.

372
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,080
Don't you just want me
to turn myself in?

373
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,519
You want me to testify...

374
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,960
that Wang Zhen Long instructed me...

375
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,240
to frame Mr. Chi.

376
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,160
What an ingrate.

377
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,680
Five million yuan.

378
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
I just want five million yuan.

379
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:50,720
Give it to me
and I'll turn myself in...

380
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,040
to get Mr. Chi out.

381
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,280
Wang Zhen Long only
gave you one million.

382
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,640
If I turn myself in...

383
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,439
and go to jail for a few years,

384
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,839
my career is basically ruined
after I get out.

385
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
Five million yuan...

386
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,880
to clear Mr. Chi's name.

387
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,160
Isn't it worth it?

388
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,816
I've already found a lawyer.

389
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,080
Tomorrow,
I'll be able to meet Chi Cheng.

390
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,760
Can I meet him?

391
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,439
I'm afraid not.

392
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,760
If we do that,
they'll take a huge risk.

393
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,000
Don't worry.

394
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,656
We'll cooperate with them
to investigate and collect evidence.

395
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
Okay.

396
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,680
Then go see him for me.

397
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,840
Is there anything
you want to say to him?

398
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,960
I'll pass it on for you.

399
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,240
Tell him to eat well.

400
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Stop thinking about it.

401
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,840
In the blink of an eye,

402
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,480
two years have passed.

403
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Back then,

404
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,080
when I first sat here,

405
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,200
I had nothing.

406
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,840
Now,

407
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,480
I might still end up with nothing.

408
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
Da Wei.

409
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,040
This is the money I saved.

410
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,360
Take it for now.

411
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
No.

412
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,720
Your clinic
is like a charity organization.

413
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,000
You don't make much money.

414
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,360
Take it first.

415
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,360
Every penny counts.

416
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Xiao Shuai.

417
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Listen to me.

418
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,720
You really don't need to worry
about the money.

419
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,520
I just want to resolve this
on my own.

420
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,800
You lost your company.

421
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,480
How can you make money
out of thin air?

422
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,200
Can you stop forcing yourself
to be strong?

423
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,800
It's not like you won't pay me back.

424
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Da Wei.

425
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,320
Didn't you use to like
taking petty advantages?

426
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,640
Why are you treating me
like a stranger now?

427
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,240
You really don't have
to worry about me.

428
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
I've already...

429
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,656
put the house in my hometown...

430
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,920
on the real estate listing.

431
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,560
If it doesn't work out,

432
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,360
this money can still help.

433
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,280
It's the house your mom left you.

434
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,320
We'll see how it goes.

435
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
After all,

436
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,240
I don't want to see
Chi Cheng being locked up in there.

437
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,239
Honey, let me tell you.

438
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,919
This house needs a lot of repairs.

439
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,400
It will cost a lot. Seriously.

440
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,680
Please put out your cigarette.

441
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,440
My late mom hated it the most
when people smoked in the house.

442
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
Wait.

443
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,680
Didn't your mom pass away? Gosh.

444
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,760
What are you saying?

445
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Be careful.

446
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,280
You burned my chair.

447
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,999
Hey.

448
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,919
Look at you.
Are you selling this house or not?

449
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,200
If not, don't waste our time.

450
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,959
There are many houses
waiting for me to view after this.

451
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,360
- I'm selling it.
- Let's go.

452
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,879
Six million yuan.

453
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,280
One-time, full payment.

454
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,560
One-time, full payment?

455
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
How about this?

456
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,960
I can do full payment,
but for five million yuan.

457
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,999
- Didn't we agree on six million?
- No.

458
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,896
The market price of this house
is already seven million yuan.

459
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,199
Wait, aren't you in a hurry to sell
and use the money?

460
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,639
Let me tell you.
My offer is just five million yuan.

461
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,400
Not a penny more.
Take it or leave it.

462
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,399
We'll sell it.
How can we not sell it?

463
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,719
Don't be impatient.

464
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
Well...

465
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Okay.

466
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
Deal.

467
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Five million yuan.

468
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,760
But there are conditions.

469
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,000
The layout of this house
can't be changed.

470
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,440
Also,

471
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,680
this loquat tree...

472
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,480
can't be touched either.

473
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,359
This... This tree?

474
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,360
No problem.

475
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:42,280
- Wait. What's up with this tree?
- It's fine.

476
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,880
We won't touch it.

477
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,679
Did you bury gold down there?

478
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,680
I didn't.

479
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:49,919
If there's no gold buried,
why are you worried about the tree?

480
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,280
Just say if you agree or not.

481
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,839
Fine. We'll do as you say.

482
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,119
All right, I'll prepare
the contract now.

483
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,400
Hey, add these clauses
to the contract.

484
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Okay.

485
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,479
- Wait.
- Add them.

486
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,159
Why is he so fussy?

487
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,239
Have you seen anyone like this?

488
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,319
Let's go.

489
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,679
He sold the house,
but he still wants the tree.

490
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,320
How many fruits
will it bear each year?

491
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
Dad.

492
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
Mom.

493
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
I'm sorry.

494
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,680
In the future,
I'll definitely buy the house back,

495
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,760
no matter how much it costs.

496
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,480
I heard the police and the lawyer...

497
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,160
have found some preliminary clues.

498
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,320
The suspicion on Chi Cheng
decreased a lot.

499
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,080
The lawyer also said...

500
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,440
that I can visit
in a couple of days.

501
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
So soon?

502
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,680
Then you will be able
to see Chi Cheng soon.

503
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,560
Why do you seem unhappy?

504
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
I don't know.

505
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,640
I'm just a bit flustered.

506
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,280
Maybe it's been too long
since I last saw him.

507
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,800
Who's here?

508
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,880
You'll know when you see him.

509
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,640
Have a seat.

510
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,240
Why did you lose weight?

511
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Did you miss me?

512
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,040
What do you think?

513
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
How would I know?

514
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
I missed you.

515
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,880
Did you miss me?

516
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,960
I did.

517
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,600
How much?

518
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,280
I missed you so much...

519
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,480
that I handed over
my little treasury.

520
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
What did you say?

521
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
It's nothing.

522
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,280
Your case
will go to trial in two days.

523
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,360
Besides the little treasury,

524
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,720
what else did you give up?

525
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
The old house.

526
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,520
Why didn't you sell my house?

527
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,200
I don't want your family
to look down on me.

528
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,880
Then borrow money from Cheng Yu.

529
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,000
It's because
the two of us are family.

530
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,720
You always said...

531
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,320
I'm a cheapskate...

532
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,560
who doesn't spend anything.

533
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,320
This time, I spent everything.

534
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,360
Let's see how you can diss me
in the future.

535
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,600
You're my financier.

536
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,960
As long as you come back,
I can make money.

537
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,960
If you stay in here,
I'll suffer the biggest loss.

538
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,600
So after calculating it,

539
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,320
it's better to get you out of here.

540
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,680
Actually, I regret it too.

541
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,720
I should have given you
more allowance back then.

542
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,400
Now that I've given the money
to other people, I realize...

543
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
that 10 or 20 yuan
is really nothing.

544
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
Actually,

545
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,240
my little treasury
is for our retirement.

546
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,360
If you can't get out,

547
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,520
what's the use of that money to me?

548
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
So...

549
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,680
I'm not buying your freedom.

550
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,120
I'm buying my own security.

551
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
You know what?

552
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:15,600
When I sleep at home all alone now,
I feel really scared.

553
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,000
I just want you to come back.

554
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,439
I don't want a life of luxury.

555
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,640
I only want you.

556
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
Chi Cheng.

557
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,040
Say something.

558
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,440
Chi Cheng!

559
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,120
Say something.

560
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
I hate you.

561
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,400
Look at you.
You still have over 10 minutes.

562
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,480
Hey, he's back in his cell.

563
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,560
You should go too.

564
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,519
(Prison Cell)

565
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,680
1706.

566
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
It's time to eat.
