00:01:47.995 --> 00:01:48.835
Come on.

00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:51.755
Thank you.

00:01:52.594 --> 00:01:53.434
Thank you.

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:55.154
Take your time.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.275
(This is)

00:01:56.275 --> 00:01:57.635
(tragic reality in this city.)

00:01:58.554 --> 00:01:59.394
(It seems we must)

00:01:59.394 --> 00:02:00.594
(think of an idea quickly)

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:01.835
(to repel the Wutuo.)

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:02.675
Is this enough?

00:02:04.195 --> 00:02:05.035
General Wu'an,

00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:06.635
the congee is shared.

00:02:07.555 --> 00:02:08.595
By the way, Ms. Qi Luo,

00:02:09.394 --> 00:02:10.355
didn't we send people

00:02:10.435 --> 00:02:12.355
to inform their families
to pick them up?

00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:14.714
Why hasn't anyone returned home?

00:02:14.954 --> 00:02:16.035
They were abducted

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:17.514
and violated.

00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:20.274
Their families think they're a disgrace,

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.514
refusing to take them back.

00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:25.794
This calamity wasn't their choice.

00:02:26.554 --> 00:02:28.075
They've narrowly escaped death,

00:02:28.475 --> 00:02:29.755
but their families bar the door.

00:02:30.554 --> 00:02:31.875
How ridiculous.

00:02:32.475 --> 00:02:33.755
If they were men,

00:02:34.514 --> 00:02:35.435
they'd already be home

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:36.954
with their families.

00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:39.794
Maybe even praised as heroes.

00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:41.915
How could that be heroic?

00:02:42.274 --> 00:02:43.155
True heroes like you.

00:02:43.432 --> 00:02:44.635
Protecting homes and citizens.

00:02:45.114 --> 00:02:45.994
That's real heroism.

00:02:47.075 --> 00:02:47.915
And my master.

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:49.274
You two

00:02:49.274 --> 00:02:51.554
are both great heroes
defending Wei's people.

00:02:54.114 --> 00:02:55.595
I won't claim to be a hero.

00:02:56.355 --> 00:02:57.195
As for Li Kuang,

00:02:58.504 --> 00:03:00.035
heroes don't follow the crowd

00:03:00.435 --> 00:03:03.435
or push suffering people
deeper into despair.

00:03:04.035 --> 00:03:05.475
Nor would they save rations

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:08.514
by starving those they should protect.

00:03:09.075 --> 00:03:11.114
Are you blaming my master?

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:13.394
He has his difficulties.

00:03:13.755 --> 00:03:15.234
The city's food reserves are low.

00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:16.755
He's deeply concerned.

00:03:16.954 --> 00:03:17.794
So...

00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:19.995
Ms. Qi Luo,

00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:20.995
are you alright?

00:03:21.514 --> 00:03:22.514
I have some ointment.

00:03:22.755 --> 00:03:23.595
I'll get it for you.

00:03:23.674 --> 00:03:25.875
These minor injuries are nothing.

00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:27.355
Don't blame my master.

00:03:27.834 --> 00:03:29.195
He's actually kind-hearted.

00:03:29.994 --> 00:03:31.755
He saved me from street thugs

00:03:32.274 --> 00:03:33.274
and gave me food

00:03:33.994 --> 00:03:35.755
and shelter.

00:03:36.195 --> 00:03:37.075
Ms. Qi Luo,

00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:39.195
is this what 'good' means?

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:40.715
He married you.

00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:42.755
Shouldn't he care for you?

00:03:43.435 --> 00:03:44.674
In these chaotic times,

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:45.915
as a woman,

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:47.394
I belong to him.

00:03:47.674 --> 00:03:49.915
It's my duty to serve him well,

00:03:50.475 --> 00:03:52.155
respect him, obey him,

00:03:52.394 --> 00:03:53.674
and make him my universe.

00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:54.715
Slow down.

00:03:55.114 --> 00:03:55.954
Be careful.

00:03:57.475 --> 00:03:58.315
Is this better?

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:04.315
Master.

00:04:05.114 --> 00:04:06.075
I'm scared.

00:04:06.755 --> 00:04:08.075
I don't want to go.

00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:10.794
I only want to stay with you.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.755
I don't want to be anyone's example.

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:17.034
Rundu must not fall to Wutuo.

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:19.354
As Rundu's defender,

00:04:20.354 --> 00:04:22.315
I'll protect it even
at the cost of my life.

00:04:23.594 --> 00:04:25.354
But with our current forces,

00:04:25.594 --> 00:04:26.834
we stand no chance.

00:04:27.154 --> 00:04:28.235
We must burn our boats

00:04:28.354 --> 00:04:29.194
and fight them

00:04:29.195 --> 00:04:30.115
to the bitter end!

00:04:31.075 --> 00:04:32.994
You and those female captives
are vanguards.

00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:35.154
After you distract the Wutuo forces,

00:04:36.034 --> 00:04:37.235
I'll lead the army to battle

00:04:37.914 --> 00:04:39.235
and die defending Rundu.

00:04:50.235 --> 00:04:51.315
I understand now.

00:04:57.354 --> 00:04:58.514
I'll go.

00:05:01.195 --> 00:05:02.555
Please take care.

00:05:05.755 --> 00:05:07.154
He, He.

00:05:09.155 --> 00:05:10.834
Mai and I heard something

00:05:10.834 --> 00:05:11.674
on our way here.

00:05:11.994 --> 00:05:12.834
Li Kuang

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:14.248
plans to send the women we rescued

00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:15.795
to the battlefield

00:05:15.795 --> 00:05:16.875
to fight the enemies!

00:05:18.914 --> 00:05:20.514
He's sending them to die!

00:05:24.954 --> 00:05:25.794
Let's go.

00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:46.154
Tainted by the enemy.

00:05:47.034 --> 00:05:48.154
Disgrace to the family.

00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:50.834
Not worthy to live.

00:05:52.474 --> 00:05:53.394
Not worthy to live.

00:06:03.034 --> 00:06:03.874
Mr. Wang,

00:06:04.315 --> 00:06:05.474
as the Military Director,

00:06:05.914 --> 00:06:07.154
I can command you.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:08.874
By my order,

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:10.075
do not open the gate.

00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:12.635
Mr. Chu.

00:06:12.995 --> 00:06:14.435
All hangs on this move.

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:17.115
But I serve Rundu's garrison.

00:06:17.755 --> 00:06:19.394
We only obey Commander Li's orders.

00:06:20.954 --> 00:06:21.794
Open the gate.

00:06:23.995 --> 00:06:24.835
Mr. Wang!

00:06:29.274 --> 00:06:30.354
Open the gate!

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:09.795
Let me see who will open it!

00:07:10.315 --> 00:07:11.755
This is Rundu.

00:07:12.075 --> 00:07:14.034
I'm General Wu'an
appointed by His Majesty.

00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:15.914
Not under your jurisdiction.

00:07:17.674 --> 00:07:19.354
I'm not your soldier.

00:07:29.514 --> 00:07:30.354
Lure the enemy?

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:31.874
Commander Li.

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:33.394
You're just sacrificing lives.

00:07:34.195 --> 00:07:35.035
General Wu'an.

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:36.635
Your contributions to Rundu

00:07:36.954 --> 00:07:38.235
are deeply appreciated.

00:07:38.755 --> 00:07:39.635
But even so,

00:07:39.795 --> 00:07:41.595
you can't interfere in
our military affairs.

00:07:42.435 --> 00:07:44.315
If you overstep again,

00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:45.595
just leave Rundu.

00:07:45.754 --> 00:07:47.434
You're the one who should leave!

00:07:49.995 --> 00:07:50.875
Please calm down.

00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:54.675
Don't blame Commander Li.

00:07:55.394 --> 00:07:56.234
We

00:07:56.675 --> 00:07:57.594
volunteered.

00:07:58.795 --> 00:07:59.635
We are

00:07:59.834 --> 00:08:01.274
defiled.

00:08:02.075 --> 00:08:03.635
No dignity to keep living.

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:06.435
If our deaths

00:08:07.034 --> 00:08:08.514
can gain Rundu an advantage,

00:08:08.795 --> 00:08:10.834
we'll cleanse our shame

00:08:11.315 --> 00:08:12.594
and die with honor.

00:08:13.195 --> 00:08:14.954
Commander Li
entrusted us with this task.

00:08:15.354 --> 00:08:16.514
He's giving us chances.

00:08:17.875 --> 00:08:18.715
If we can

00:08:19.274 --> 00:08:20.474
deceive the Wutuo enemies

00:08:20.915 --> 00:08:21.755
and make them believe

00:08:21.755 --> 00:08:22.995
Rundu has no fighters left,

00:08:23.474 --> 00:08:25.115
we'll gain an advantage

00:08:25.514 --> 00:08:26.354
and strike them

00:08:26.354 --> 00:08:27.474
unprepared at the showdown.

00:08:27.914 --> 00:08:28.754
Chances?

00:08:29.315 --> 00:08:30.795
So I'm blocking your way to merit?

00:08:34.634 --> 00:08:35.474
Yes.

00:08:36.195 --> 00:08:37.114
In crisis,

00:08:37.915 --> 00:08:39.435
we should unite

00:08:39.634 --> 00:08:40.555
against foes.

00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:43.035
But not by sending you
to die pointlessly.

00:08:43.515 --> 00:08:44.675
This isn't courage.

00:08:45.114 --> 00:08:45.994
This is foolishness.

00:08:46.435 --> 00:08:47.354
Watch your words!

00:08:49.155 --> 00:08:49.995
Li Kuang,

00:08:50.474 --> 00:08:51.834
as Rundu's commander,

00:08:52.594 --> 00:08:55.435
you point blades
at your women and people.

00:08:56.075 --> 00:08:56.915
What's this?

00:08:57.634 --> 00:08:58.634
They volunteered.

00:08:59.515 --> 00:09:00.555
Their sortie

00:09:00.594 --> 00:09:02.355
is to deceive the enemy and buy time.

00:09:02.994 --> 00:09:05.435
As the Rundu commander,
I'll lead the charge

00:09:06.075 --> 00:09:07.834
and fight to the death
defending this city.

00:09:08.474 --> 00:09:09.874
Better die meaningfully

00:09:10.275 --> 00:09:11.354
than live in shame.

00:09:13.075 --> 00:09:13.915
Volunteered?

00:09:16.114 --> 00:09:16.954
Let me ask you.

00:09:18.075 --> 00:09:19.594
Are you truly willing?

00:09:24.395 --> 00:09:25.874
I... I...

00:09:26.555 --> 00:09:27.834
I don't want to die.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.954
I want to live with dignity.

00:09:34.834 --> 00:09:36.195
You shouldn't feel ashamed.

00:09:36.874 --> 00:09:37.915
Shame belongs to

00:09:38.395 --> 00:09:39.634
Commander Li.

00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:44.995
Li Kuang.

00:09:45.195 --> 00:09:46.275
Did they volunteer

00:09:46.714 --> 00:09:48.675
or were they forced to do this?

00:09:49.315 --> 00:09:50.634
You know the truth.

00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:53.435
Aren't they Rundu's citizens?

00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:56.035
As the city's commander,

00:09:56.555 --> 00:09:57.395
you make

00:09:57.395 --> 00:09:59.634
those you should protect die needlessly.

00:10:02.114 --> 00:10:02.954
Swords

00:10:03.795 --> 00:10:05.155
are for enemies.

00:10:05.994 --> 00:10:07.754
Never against the weak.

00:10:10.315 --> 00:10:11.155
Yes.

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.354
Never against the weak.

00:10:24.795 --> 00:10:25.635
Commander.

00:10:33.994 --> 00:10:35.315
You haven't changed.

00:10:36.395 --> 00:10:37.315
General Zhang

00:10:37.954 --> 00:10:39.915
used a few citizens as bait.

00:10:40.954 --> 00:10:42.275
It lacked compassion.

00:10:42.954 --> 00:10:44.714
But compared to losing the city,

00:10:45.195 --> 00:10:48.594
it was minor.

00:10:49.035 --> 00:10:52.195
So, in a crisis, we must
make such a trade-off.

00:10:54.435 --> 00:10:55.275
Sir,

00:10:55.675 --> 00:10:57.075
but I hold a different view.

00:10:57.915 --> 00:10:59.395
I understand General Zhang.

00:10:59.795 --> 00:11:00.915
But if it were me,

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:02.714
I would never act this way.

00:11:03.275 --> 00:11:04.834
I'd lead the remaining soldiers

00:11:05.195 --> 00:11:06.035
to fight the rebels

00:11:06.435 --> 00:11:07.915
at the city gates.

00:11:08.915 --> 00:11:10.234
The one who wields the sword

00:11:10.634 --> 00:11:11.474
must know

00:11:11.874 --> 00:11:13.874
whether the blade is meant

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:16.315
for the enemy in front

00:11:16.834 --> 00:11:18.435
or the weak behind them.

00:11:21.354 --> 00:11:23.195
I will never draw
my sword against the weak.

00:11:37.075 --> 00:11:39.555
C-C-Commander Xiao's here? How?

00:11:40.675 --> 00:11:41.954
Do you think

00:11:42.394 --> 00:11:43.234
it's because of...?

00:11:43.234 --> 00:11:44.994
Because of our absence from camp,

00:11:45.474 --> 00:11:46.314
he came to punish us?

00:11:47.714 --> 00:11:49.795
No, that can't be it.

00:11:50.315 --> 00:11:51.474
He seems in good spirits.

00:11:52.195 --> 00:11:53.075
He even smiled.

00:11:54.234 --> 00:11:55.074
Really?

00:11:55.275 --> 00:11:56.234
Absolutely true.

00:11:56.874 --> 00:12:00.395
D-D-Don't worry.

00:12:00.395 --> 00:12:01.994
S-S-Stop mocking me.

00:12:03.474 --> 00:12:04.314
General Fengyun,

00:12:04.795 --> 00:12:05.635
how did you get in?

00:12:06.234 --> 00:12:07.155
I fought my way through

00:12:07.714 --> 00:12:08.675
with my battalion.

00:12:10.155 --> 00:12:11.714
Commander Xiao, it must be hard work.

00:12:14.795 --> 00:12:15.635
Commander Li,

00:12:16.714 --> 00:12:18.354
General Wu'an is my man.

00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:20.675
My soldiers' discipline

00:12:21.354 --> 00:12:22.435
is my own responsibility.

00:12:22.954 --> 00:12:24.354
No outsiders may interfere.

00:12:25.354 --> 00:12:26.195
Besides,

00:12:27.395 --> 00:12:28.235
he wasn't wrong.

00:12:32.275 --> 00:12:34.675
I know I'm the one at fault.

00:12:34.714 --> 00:12:36.515
But I'm ready to die defending Rundu.

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:37.634
Already thinking of defeat?

00:12:37.994 --> 00:12:40.075
Rundu needs
no cowardly commanders like you.

00:12:47.315 --> 00:12:48.474
Warriors fear not death

00:12:49.474 --> 00:12:50.994
but wield swords to protect our land

00:12:51.834 --> 00:12:52.915
and our people.

00:13:01.474 --> 00:13:02.314
Soldiers!

00:13:02.634 --> 00:13:03.515
Both we and the Wutuo

00:13:03.915 --> 00:13:04.795
lack supplies.

00:13:05.354 --> 00:13:06.714
This is a do-or-die battle.

00:13:07.195 --> 00:13:09.474
The brave will win.

00:13:10.114 --> 00:13:10.954
Besides,

00:13:11.954 --> 00:13:14.515
General Fengyun's reinforcements
have arrived.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.354
Director Chu of the Ministry of War

00:13:17.994 --> 00:13:19.195
has brought us provisions.

00:13:20.354 --> 00:13:23.395
Millions of Wei citizens
stand behind us.

00:13:24.195 --> 00:13:25.234
As warriors,

00:13:25.874 --> 00:13:27.555
we raise swords to protect our land

00:13:27.795 --> 00:13:28.714
and our people!

00:13:29.754 --> 00:13:30.594
Soldiers!

00:13:30.915 --> 00:13:32.075
Will you join me

00:13:32.714 --> 00:13:35.035
to fight the enemy outside, repel Wutuo,

00:13:35.634 --> 00:13:36.634
and defend Rundu

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:38.435
and Wei?

00:13:38.874 --> 00:13:39.754
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:13:40.594 --> 00:13:41.434
General Fengyun

00:13:42.035 --> 00:13:43.754
and General Wu'an stand with Rundu.

00:13:44.395 --> 00:13:45.235
This battle,

00:13:45.714 --> 00:13:46.754
we will win!

00:13:47.515 --> 00:13:51.655
- Win!
- Win!

00:13:51.655 --> 00:13:55.795
- Win!
- Win!

00:14:24.994 --> 00:14:25.834
The wind's here.

00:14:29.315 --> 00:14:30.155
Smoke out!

00:14:33.384 --> 00:14:34.696
(Rundu City)

00:14:56.475 --> 00:14:57.315
What?

00:14:57.315 --> 00:14:58.195
What's all this smoke?

00:14:58.275 --> 00:14:59.115
Yeah.

00:14:59.354 --> 00:15:00.194
Such dense smoke.

00:15:09.954 --> 00:15:11.035
Commander, please...

00:15:11.915 --> 00:15:12.755
Hear that?

00:15:22.994 --> 00:15:23.834
Arrows approaching.

00:15:39.354 --> 00:15:40.515
A mere smokescreen.

00:15:41.035 --> 00:15:41.875
Nothing to fear.

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.115
Archers, ready.

00:16:27.075 --> 00:16:27.915
Charge!

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:54.194
Capture their leader first.

00:18:09.315 --> 00:18:10.515
(They fight with no retreat.)

00:18:11.035 --> 00:18:12.515
(So I'm their true target.)

00:18:13.914 --> 00:18:14.995
All troops, heed orders!

00:18:15.755 --> 00:18:16.715
Defend the headquarters!

00:18:17.634 --> 00:18:18.715
Let their blood

00:18:18.995 --> 00:18:20.194
consecrate our banners!

00:18:22.035 --> 00:18:23.235
Defend the headquarters!

00:18:24.515 --> 00:18:25.355
Charge!

00:18:25.715 --> 00:18:26.995
- Charge!
- Charge!

00:19:05.914 --> 00:19:06.955
Sacrificing your own man.

00:19:07.114 --> 00:19:08.075
How heartless.

00:19:08.555 --> 00:19:09.395
Dying for me

00:19:09.634 --> 00:19:10.555
is their noblest end.

00:19:57.874 --> 00:19:59.114
Comrades who stand together

00:19:59.715 --> 00:20:00.995
make true commanders.

00:20:11.154 --> 00:20:11.994
Xiao Jue!

00:20:26.674 --> 00:20:27.515
Xiao Jue!

00:20:32.194 --> 00:20:34.674
Xiao Jue!

00:20:43.154 --> 00:20:43.994
Xiao Jue.

00:20:44.995 --> 00:20:45.835
Xiao Jue.

00:21:16.114 --> 00:21:17.354
Xiao Jue.

00:21:34.834 --> 00:21:37.194
Xiao Jue!

00:21:57.434 --> 00:21:59.035
Xiao Jue.

I'd never see you again.

00:23:30.434 --> 00:23:31.274

We're short-handed.

Go to ask Yan He

00:24:17.555 --> 00:24:18.395
for reinforcements.

00:24:19.114 --> 00:24:19.954
The journey's long.

00:24:20.075 --> 00:24:20.915
Ride at full speed.

00:24:21.275 --> 00:24:22.115
Depart immediately.

00:24:22.194 --> 00:24:23.034
Yes.

00:24:23.707 --> 00:24:25.059
(Yan)

00:24:26.755 --> 00:24:27.595
Xiao Huaijin.

00:24:45.235 --> 00:24:46.315
The supplies have arrived.

00:24:46.834 --> 00:24:47.914
Yingxiang and Ms. Qi Luo

00:24:48.194 --> 00:24:50.154
are making congee
with the rescued women.

00:24:50.154 --> 00:24:51.995
Thanks to your foresight, Mr. Chu.

00:24:52.354 --> 00:24:53.755
Before coming, you had Yingxiang

00:24:53.795 --> 00:24:54.674
gather provisions.

00:24:55.834 --> 00:24:57.555
I don't deserve such praise.

00:24:58.075 --> 00:24:59.275
My part was small.

00:24:59.755 --> 00:25:00.715
We brought in the grain

00:25:00.914 --> 00:25:01.914
after the battle ended.

00:25:02.755 --> 00:25:03.834
Thank you, Commander Xiao.

00:25:04.475 --> 00:25:05.434
You led reinforcements

00:25:05.755 --> 00:25:06.955
and summoned General Yan He.

00:25:07.995 --> 00:25:08.874
It's my duty.

00:25:09.315 --> 00:25:10.594
No thanks needed, Mr. Chu.

00:25:10.914 --> 00:25:11.754
Everyone.

00:25:13.874 --> 00:25:14.955
Rundu survived this crisis

00:25:15.194 --> 00:25:16.434
through your assistance.

00:25:17.235 --> 00:25:18.955
On behalf of all in Rundu,

00:25:19.275 --> 00:25:20.115
let me say thank you.

00:25:23.394 --> 00:25:24.275
Don't mention it.

00:25:24.995 --> 00:25:25.835
Protecting civilians

00:25:26.075 --> 00:25:27.035
is our duty.

00:25:27.475 --> 00:25:28.354
Aiding each other

00:25:28.715 --> 00:25:29.555
is our obligation.

00:25:30.275 --> 00:25:31.115
No thanks required.

00:25:32.114 --> 00:25:32.954
Yeah.

00:25:33.075 --> 00:25:33.915
Duty.

00:25:34.475 --> 00:25:35.315
Obligation.

00:25:35.755 --> 00:25:36.834
But some people...

00:25:47.235 --> 00:25:48.075
General Wu'an,

00:25:48.395 --> 00:25:49.235
you remind me

00:25:49.235 --> 00:25:50.235
of my friend.

00:25:54.114 --> 00:25:56.035
No, the person he used to be.

00:26:08.515 --> 00:26:09.355
Don't tell me

00:26:09.715 --> 00:26:11.955
he thinks you resemble He Rufei.

00:26:13.795 --> 00:26:14.874
What's wrong with him?

00:26:15.275 --> 00:26:16.874
You're much better than He Rufei.

00:26:17.755 --> 00:26:18.595
How about

00:26:18.874 --> 00:26:19.715
you leave Xiao Jue

00:26:20.275 --> 00:26:21.434
and join my command?

00:26:29.715 --> 00:26:30.555
Yan He.

00:26:30.955 --> 00:26:31.795
So eager

00:26:32.154 --> 00:26:33.394
to poach him?

00:26:34.114 --> 00:26:35.914
Shouldn't you ask me first?

00:26:36.715 --> 00:26:37.555
Cold Xiao,

00:26:37.874 --> 00:26:38.834
why so stingy?

00:26:40.154 --> 00:26:40.994
Commander Xiao.

00:26:41.715 --> 00:26:42.555
Mr. He

00:26:42.795 --> 00:26:43.995
is now General Wu'an.

00:26:44.555 --> 00:26:45.434
Where he wants to go

00:26:46.955 --> 00:26:47.795
isn't your decision.

00:26:52.394 --> 00:26:54.114
Of course it's not my decision.

00:26:58.715 --> 00:26:59.555
Where he goes,

00:27:00.434 --> 00:27:01.274
what he does,

00:27:02.394 --> 00:27:03.475
it's all his choice.

00:27:36.515 --> 00:27:37.355
Commander.

00:27:39.594 --> 00:27:40.434
Commander,

00:27:40.594 --> 00:27:41.555
I was going to see you.

00:27:42.315 --> 00:27:43.354
Leaving Yezhou Garrison

00:27:43.475 --> 00:27:44.634
was my decision alone.

00:27:45.154 --> 00:27:46.275
Wang Ba and Huang Xiong

00:27:46.674 --> 00:27:47.715
were forced by me.

00:27:48.354 --> 00:27:49.594
Please don't punish them.

00:27:50.194 --> 00:27:51.035
All blame

00:27:51.555 --> 00:27:52.795
should fall on me alone.

00:27:54.475 --> 00:27:55.315
Is that all?

00:27:55.914 --> 00:27:56.754
Yes.

00:28:00.194 --> 00:28:01.034
Follow me.

00:28:35.795 --> 00:28:36.635
Commander.

00:28:37.434 --> 00:28:38.274
What's this about?

00:28:40.035 --> 00:28:41.154
Before resolving the matter,

00:28:42.354 --> 00:28:43.475
you left a letter

00:28:44.275 --> 00:28:46.235
and a pouch and then disappeared.

00:28:47.235 --> 00:28:48.075
What's that about?

00:28:53.035 --> 00:28:53.875
What?

00:28:54.275 --> 00:28:55.354
You left something else?

00:28:57.114 --> 00:28:57.954
Nothing else.

00:28:59.634 --> 00:29:00.674
I left the letter

00:29:01.275 --> 00:29:02.115
because

00:29:02.475 --> 00:29:03.874
I've earned the general title,

00:29:04.515 --> 00:29:05.634
but I'm still your soldier.

00:29:06.275 --> 00:29:07.194
I left without orders,

00:29:07.515 --> 00:29:08.594
and I must tell you why.

00:29:09.154 --> 00:29:10.475
As for this pouch,

00:29:12.674 --> 00:29:13.755
I took the Qinglang Sword

00:29:14.315 --> 00:29:15.354
without permission.

00:29:15.955 --> 00:29:17.954
This pouch serves as my apology.

00:29:32.275 --> 00:29:33.115
He Yan,

00:29:33.674 --> 00:29:35.194
my judgment was clouded,

00:29:35.995 --> 00:29:37.394
and I couldn't move past it,

00:29:38.075 --> 00:29:38.915
so I mistakenly

00:29:39.235 --> 00:29:41.874
equated you with that scheming wretch,

00:29:42.515 --> 00:29:43.434
He Rufei.

00:29:45.315 --> 00:29:46.235
I should've known it.

00:29:46.674 --> 00:29:48.954
You are just you.

00:29:49.634 --> 00:29:50.515
You've always been

00:29:51.275 --> 00:29:52.634
my tenacious classmate

00:29:53.674 --> 00:29:55.154
with unwavering integrity,

00:29:57.634 --> 00:29:59.114
the general who defended our borders

00:30:00.715 --> 00:30:02.434
without hesitation
even in mortal danger.

00:30:05.515 --> 00:30:06.674
After returning from Peidu,

00:30:07.594 --> 00:30:08.674
I wanted to apologize

00:30:09.874 --> 00:30:11.394
and clarify everything

00:30:13.154 --> 00:30:14.114
and then accompany you

00:30:15.035 --> 00:30:16.075
to reinforce Rundu.

00:30:17.475 --> 00:30:18.315
But by then,

00:30:19.194 --> 00:30:20.594
you had left Yezhou Garrison.

00:30:22.594 --> 00:30:23.434
I thought

00:30:25.235 --> 00:30:26.475
you must have gone to Rundu.

00:30:29.315 --> 00:30:30.354
While in Chonghuai,

00:30:31.514 --> 00:30:33.434
I considered confessing
everything to you.

00:30:34.434 --> 00:30:36.075
But while I was still hesitating,

00:30:36.594 --> 00:30:37.834
you uncovered it yourself.

00:30:39.594 --> 00:30:40.434
He Yan,

00:30:41.512 --> 00:30:43.715
no matter what storms lie ahead,

00:30:46.315 --> 00:30:47.394
I will always trust you

00:30:49.795 --> 00:30:50.755
and stand with you

00:30:52.475 --> 00:30:53.555
to overcome hardship.

00:30:57.634 --> 00:30:58.474
Good.

00:31:00.634 --> 00:31:01.474
Long time no see,

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:03.434
Commander Xiao.

00:31:08.755 --> 00:31:09.595
It's been a while,

00:31:11.515 --> 00:31:12.355
General He.

00:31:26.114 --> 00:31:27.475
Miss... Miss He,

00:31:27.995 --> 00:31:29.394
my temper was terrible,

00:31:29.755 --> 00:31:30.834
and I was hostile to you.

00:31:31.195 --> 00:31:33.434
The Commander had me
look into He Rufei in the capital.

00:31:33.994 --> 00:31:35.715
Then I realized I'd wronged you.

00:31:36.955 --> 00:31:37.795
Please forgive me.

00:31:38.834 --> 00:31:39.674
It's understandable.

00:31:40.354 --> 00:31:41.194
I bear no grudge.

00:31:41.914 --> 00:31:42.754
Besides,

00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:44.275
didn't the Commander

00:31:44.594 --> 00:31:46.715
give me the cold shoulder for days?

00:31:50.475 --> 00:31:52.674
You're magnanimous, Miss He.

00:31:54.275 --> 00:31:55.115
Please forgive me.

00:31:58.154 --> 00:31:59.475
I'm generous,

00:32:00.075 --> 00:32:01.315
so you're forgiven.

00:32:07.434 --> 00:32:08.594
But as for some matters,

00:32:09.995 --> 00:32:11.555
I can never overlook them.

00:32:13.394 --> 00:32:16.075
I must personally expose
He Rufei's hypocrisy

00:32:16.776 --> 00:32:18.154
and ensure both he and Xu Jingfu

00:32:18.555 --> 00:32:19.874
face proper justice.

00:32:20.515 --> 00:32:21.634
Following your orders,

00:32:22.154 --> 00:32:24.034
I investigated the Huayuan Battle.

00:32:24.034 --> 00:32:26.235
The seven generals
initially divided into

00:32:26.515 --> 00:32:27.555
three groups as planned

00:32:28.035 --> 00:32:30.154
to support He Rufei who was
against Wutuo's main army.

00:32:30.794 --> 00:32:31.634
But en route,

00:32:31.634 --> 00:32:32.995
they all fell into Wutuo ambushes.

00:32:33.475 --> 00:32:34.475
All seven perished.

00:32:34.914 --> 00:32:36.275
Then He Rufei avenged them

00:32:36.755 --> 00:32:38.075
by crushing the Wutuo forces

00:32:38.434 --> 00:32:39.674
and driving them from Huayuan.

00:32:39.674 --> 00:32:40.874
This reeks of deception.

00:32:42.194 --> 00:32:43.874
Three separate groups

00:32:44.154 --> 00:32:45.795
were all ambushed?

00:32:46.035 --> 00:32:47.154
No survivors?

00:32:47.834 --> 00:32:49.874
He Rufei alone

00:32:50.194 --> 00:32:51.235
emerged victorious,

00:32:51.674 --> 00:32:52.514
repelling

00:32:52.515 --> 00:32:53.914
the formidable Wutuo army?

00:32:55.475 --> 00:32:56.475
He Rufei

00:32:56.834 --> 00:32:59.315
schemed to conceal his true identity.

00:32:59.834 --> 00:33:01.035
He teamed up with Wutuo again

00:33:01.434 --> 00:33:02.354
and set the ambush

00:33:02.874 --> 00:33:03.914
to kill them indirectly.

00:33:04.434 --> 00:33:06.035
Suspecting your survival,

00:33:06.914 --> 00:33:08.594
he first used the Wutuo forces to kill

00:33:09.235 --> 00:33:10.475
the Seven Tiger Generals.

00:33:11.075 --> 00:33:12.594
Then he dangled Li Kuang of Rundu

00:33:13.035 --> 00:33:13.875
as bait for you.

00:33:14.555 --> 00:33:15.795
If you rescued Li Kuang,

00:33:16.515 --> 00:33:17.755
you'd walk into his trap.

00:33:18.434 --> 00:33:19.795
He'd repeat his old tactics,

00:33:19.795 --> 00:33:22.275
using Wutuo to eliminate you.

00:33:23.515 --> 00:33:24.515
Before coming to Rundu,

00:33:25.115 --> 00:33:27.475
I knew this was his scheme.

00:33:28.435 --> 00:33:30.895
But whether for my past comrade

00:33:30.895 --> 00:33:32.755
or the people of Rundu,

00:33:33.315 --> 00:33:34.315
I had to come.

00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:37.995
He Rufei prides himself

00:33:38.555 --> 00:33:40.354
on manipulating people's minds.

00:33:41.394 --> 00:33:43.595
But he never anticipated

00:33:44.755 --> 00:33:47.154
that you would risk being charged again

00:33:47.874 --> 00:33:49.154
to reinforce Rundu.

00:33:53.154 --> 00:33:53.994
By the way,

00:33:54.194 --> 00:33:55.434
could you ask Li Kuang

00:33:55.594 --> 00:33:57.834
to draft a reinforcement request
for you and Yan He

00:33:58.475 --> 00:34:00.275
to prevent those with ulterior motives

00:34:01.275 --> 00:34:02.394
from twisting the situation?

00:34:05.154 --> 00:34:06.674
By wearing that mask this time,

00:34:07.674 --> 00:34:09.674
you've terrified the Wutuo forces.

00:34:10.395 --> 00:34:11.915
He Rufei will certainly use this

00:34:12.234 --> 00:34:13.355
to confirm your identity.

00:34:16.234 --> 00:34:17.395
Since I've come to Rundu,

00:34:17.794 --> 00:34:18.995
I'm not afraid of him knowing.

00:34:20.274 --> 00:34:21.114
When I return,

00:34:22.075 --> 00:34:24.634
I'll stand before him
with my head held high.

00:34:25.754 --> 00:34:26.875
I'll make sure he learns

00:34:29.114 --> 00:34:31.955
who the real General Feihong is.

00:34:35.355 --> 00:34:36.314
Speaking of which,

00:34:37.515 --> 00:34:39.035
since He Rufei and Xu Jingfu

00:34:39.274 --> 00:34:40.594
have been colluding for so long,

00:34:40.955 --> 00:34:41.835
there must be evidence

00:34:42.234 --> 00:34:43.515
of their collaboration.

00:34:44.075 --> 00:34:44.955
And that evidence

00:34:45.435 --> 00:34:46.314
is in the capital.

00:34:46.794 --> 00:34:48.194
So I want to return sooner

00:34:48.435 --> 00:34:50.314
to investigate potential leads.

00:34:51.475 --> 00:34:53.515
Good. I'll go with you.
