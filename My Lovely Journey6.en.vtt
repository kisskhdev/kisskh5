[Yeon Seok Oppa]

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.900
What's this, oppa?

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.067
Do you know this person?

00:57:44.067 --> 00:57:45.733
Why?

00:57:47.067 --> 00:57:49.500
It's the woman I talked about yesterday.

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.200
The one on bicycle.

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:53.900
In the video you sent,

00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:57.067
this woman keeps showing up.

00:57:57.067 --> 00:57:58.600
In my opinion,

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.433
her travel itinerary is... the same?

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.633
Yeah, that's right.

00:58:05.633 --> 00:58:08.833
We met at Motomachi Hill,

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:16.100
and we ran into each other
at Hakodate's night view spot.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.567
And we even met again today
at Akarenga Warehouse District.

[A pretty Korean woman
with long hair will come for it.]

00:58:46.883 --> 00:58:48.833
[Since she left it on the tram,
please hand it over.]

00:58:50.233 --> 00:58:53.067
The handwriting looks identical.

00:58:59.933 --> 00:59:03.333
What's her relationship with the client?

♫ Like a rain-soaked petal ♫

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:24.933
♫ That faded away powerlessly ♫

♫ The beautiful smile

♫ Is no longer here anymore ♫

00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:44.100
Unchanging things are beautiful.

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:46.233
The things that don't change.

00:59:47.733 --> 00:59:49.900
She had it all and then disappeared.

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.600
All the money I saved for the trip.

00:59:55.067 --> 00:59:58.433
A miserable life, doing anything
that brings in money

00:59:58.433 --> 01:00:00.400
just to get by.

[Hakodate Travel Itinerary]
When pushed to the extreme,

01:00:02.787 --> 01:00:05.667
the choices you make
are ones you don't even realize.

01:00:05.667 --> 01:00:09.033
I think the person you met is the one.

01:00:09.033 --> 01:00:14.400
I couldn't bring myself to say
that she lived by stealing.

01:00:15.367 --> 01:00:18.600
Do you happen to know this person?

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.367
Are you looking for Haruko?

01:00:21.367 --> 01:00:25.333
So, it's the season of storms for everyone.

01:00:26.133 --> 01:00:27.667
Maybe he has been waiting.

01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:30.067
He found the waiting so hard

01:00:30.067 --> 01:00:32.700
that he probably tried to distract
himself with something

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.400
while waiting for her.

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:39.667
Ms. Haruko.

Don't you even feel sorry for me?
