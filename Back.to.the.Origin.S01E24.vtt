WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.120
Play.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.600
Xinying, you know there's a girl

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.640
who got into a really amazing school

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.240
called Harvard.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.520
When you grow up,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.600
don't you want to go to Harvard?

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.919
Then we have to

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.120
train your willpower,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.520
okay?

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.680
Do it with Mommy.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.640
Hold out your hand.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.400
Put an ice cube in it.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.000
Yes, now squeeze.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.079
That hand, squeeze it.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.079
Count for yourself.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.800
See how long you can last.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:27.520
One,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.120
two,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.000
three.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.040
Tell yourself,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.160
I'm not afraid,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.960
it's not cold.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.000
Say it.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.680
Say I'm not afraid of the cold.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.560
Why are you so useless?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.160
Pick it up.

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:51.600
Hurry.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.400
Hurry up.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.160
Be good, pick it up.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.440
That ice cube.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.760
Can't even do this one little thing.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.840
Hold it,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.600
you hear me?

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.280
No whining.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.000
One,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.120
two.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.280
In your head,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.360
say "I'm not afraid of the cold."

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.160
Say it: I'm not afraid of the cold.

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.120
Say it.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.840
[Ailing,]

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.720
[it's me.]

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.680
[Ailing, are you home?]

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.160
[It's Feng.]

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.480
[Ailing,]

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.880
[it's Feng.]

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.160
Coming, coming.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.920
Feng.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.640
Are you feeling okay?

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.399
I'm fine.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.760
Really, I'm fine.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.200
Good.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.600
Do you want to come in?

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.240
No, no.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.640
It's about that thing from last time.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.640
My son

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.040
just called.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.080
He wants to renovate early.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.520
He'll be too busy later.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.200
So,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.400
I have to come over again.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.960
Right, right,

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:37.400
I've kept it in mind.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.880
It's just we really have too much

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.400
going on at home

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.360
lately.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.720
How about

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.920
you give me two more days?

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.240
You know

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.200
what my son's like.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.520
You can't argue with him.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.040
It's all for the kids, right?

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.159
Let's understand each other.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.240
Just hurry it up.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.040
I'll get going.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.240
Take care of yourself.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.600
Okay.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.000
Who isn't doing it for the kids, huh?

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.960
Come on.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.840
Get in.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.440
Sir, the number's 2156.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.000
Got it.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.080
There are tissues on the back seat.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.640
Thanks.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.040
Son, you okay?

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.520
I'm fine.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.080
Sometimes

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.440
you don't feel it right away.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.880
Whenever you do,

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.120
you tell me.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.520
Please fasten your seat belt.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.480
We're heading out.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.240
Okay.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.120
It protected nothing.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.520
Sir,

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.400
could you go a bit faster?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.920
My delivery's about to time out.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.960
You should swing by a hospital first.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.800
No, I'm fine.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.680
Just drop me at the intersection

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.360
up ahead on Jianshe Road.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.440
What happened?

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.280
I fell.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.760
Bike's wrecked too.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.760
I called the client to explain,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.960
but he just wouldn't hear it.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.600
Said I'm scamming him,

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.360
said if I'm late he'll complain.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.080
If I get a complaint,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.040
they'll dock my pay.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.160
You see,

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.680
honestly,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.600
in rain this heavy,

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.400
you can't get a cab anywhere.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.080
If I wasn't desperate to deliver,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.080
I'd never splurge on a ride.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.080
I'm raising this kid alone,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.160
I can't leave him home alone,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.920
so I bring him along on runs.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.560
I just don't get it.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.080
Why is life this hard?

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.160
I really feel like

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.640
I'm already doing my best.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.120
Ailing,

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.160
I'm dropping some things off.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.320
If you're not home

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.360
I'll leave them at your door,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.560
so you can take them in later.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.200
Hurry up.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.320
Give me a small one.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.600
There's only room for one more.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.600
Ailing.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:30.880
Sister.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.240
Where are you going?

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.360
Why are you here?

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.440
To bring you some things.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.960
Where are you off to?

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:40.520
We're...

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.159
- Going out.
- Moving.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.760
You sold your home ten years ago?

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.880
If I hadn't run into you today,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.240
were you planning to keep this

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.200
from me for another 10 or 20 years,

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.560
or your whole life?

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.480
You clearly don't see me

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.080
as your sister.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.960
Back when you were at teachers' college,

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.480
you came to me about everything.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.400
Exams, graduation,

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.360
boyfriends.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.280
Back then

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.280
you weren't financially independent,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.640
felt you lived off me, right?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.600
You can fly on your own now

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.760
and I'm retired,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.760
so I can't help much anymore.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.080
Selling the flat's a big thing,

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.600
and you wouldn't even consult me?

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.560
You don't even have a place

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.240
that's truly your own.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.480
How did your life end up

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.480
like this?

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.240
I'm sorry.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.040
I shouldn't scold you now.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.520
Don't cry.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.400
Please.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.320
If Mom could see you like this,

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.600
she'd blame me.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.280
I'm sorry.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.120
I haven't been paying attention to you.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:31.800
Where've you been?

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.280
I tried to find you this morning

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.200
but you were swamped.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.640
Went looking for you this afternoon

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.480
and you were gone again.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.280
Let me ask you,

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.480
why did you tell Zhang Ran

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.560
about me and Fu Yongjun?

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.600
Now everyone's awkward.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.280
From now on,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:55.880
don't

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.440
tell her family stuff, okay?

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.240
I saw you at the Chinese supermarket

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:14.920
last week.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.160
You had two kids with you.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.240
Then why didn't you call out to me?

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.040
I didn't want to bother you.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.240
Nonsense.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.120
I noticed your daughter

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.320
looks just like you.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.640
Yeah.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.040
You've never heard that?

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.160
Daughters take after their dads,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.160
sons take after their moms.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.320
But my girl's temper

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.320
is more like her mother.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.560
She doesn't talk much,

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.840
a bit icy.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.760
You're not much of a talker either.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.200
Oh, come on.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.800
I think I can chatter

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.160
- non-stop.
- Since when?

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.960
Depends who I'm with, I guess.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.160
Sometimes

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.920
you see certain people

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.840
and you just can't think of

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.760
a single word to say.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.280
Back when my wife and I

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.320
were home,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.280
we'd each

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.920
curl up with a book,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.480
sit in

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.440
our own corners

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.880
all afternoon

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.280
without saying a word.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.240
But just knowing

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.800
someone else is in the room with you,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.040
that feels pretty good.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.440
A cup of coffee, a book,

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.000
and a whole day like that,

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.080
sounds perfect.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.800
But when she

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.480
asked for a divorce,

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.040
she said

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.120
she wanted a life

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.320
with real everyday warmth.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.040
A life where you can actually argue.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.400
She likes arguing?

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.720
It's not what you think.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.040
Sometimes arguing

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.480
is just another way of talking.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.080
What I mean is that

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.080
if two people can still fight,

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.000
nothing truly huge has broken yet.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.000
When you can't even fight anymore,

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.920
that's when things are really bad.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.320
You're that hot-and-sour noodles girl,

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:24.640
right?

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.520
I ordered in your live stream.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:31.920
Thanks.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.480
Online you're so loud and bouncy.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.080
In real life you're pretty quiet.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.760
Because you don't know me yet.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.000
It's so late

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.920
and you're still on the road?

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.400
Once I drop you off, I'm done.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.440
Wife and kid are waiting at home.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:17.800
Coming.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.080
Coming.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.640
No, no, don't jump.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:37.920
Here's your express delivery.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.520
Thanks.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.600
Weather's bad today.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.840
Sorry I'm late.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:42.840
What happened to your face?

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.840
Took a spill.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.560
Stop.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.200
Sorry,

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:48.920
making you run deliveries

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.160
in this kind of rain.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:50.680
It's my job.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.400
Well,

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.680
it's tough running parcels.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.120
Could you give us a good review?

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:54.800
Sure.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.600
Great, thanks.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.800
Thanks.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.200
Okay, we'll get going.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.120
Wait.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:01.560
Hang on.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.920
No, that's not necessary.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.359
Thank you so much.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:06.200
You don't have to.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:07.800
Thank you.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.520
Here, kiddo, have some water.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.560
I'll open it for you.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.280
What should you say?

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.040
Thank you.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.119
You're welcome.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.440
Come on, let's go.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.119
Sir,

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.359
you look even better in person.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.160
Okay, we're off.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:27.640
I'll press it for you.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.200
No need.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.920
This might go a bit faster.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:32.920
Tough job you've got.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:33.880
Yeah.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:35.920
Your leg

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.480
seems badly hurt...

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.040
It's fine.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.240
It's nothing.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.280
We'll head out.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.720
You should see the doctor.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.360
Okay.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.360
Zhang Jianbin?

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.200
Zhang Jianbin?

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.120
What are you doing?

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.600
How do I get this friend request

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.040
approved faster?

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.880
You've got to wait for her to accept.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.840
I don't want to wait,

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.480
I want to

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.720
find that brat now.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.040
There's no shortcut.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.480
All you can do is to wait.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.560
Glued to your phone all day,

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.080
I thought you're capable.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.320
You're nothing, really.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:57.960
[Hi, Mom.]

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.040
Didn't you say you and Lu Xinying

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.280
were getting along great?

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.320
Did you know

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.760
your aunt and uncle

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.280
are homeless now?

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.320
Useless.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.400
Just like your father,

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.120
who can only make things worse.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.000
Utterly useless.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.680
[Can you not]

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.400
[blow up first thing in the morning?]

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.640
Send me her number.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.640
Now.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.280
I'm back home.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.720
How am I supposed to remember that?

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:25.840
I...

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.760
Who even memorizes

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.840
phone numbers these days?

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.480
You're ridiculous.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.320
What do you want it for?

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.960
I just need it.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.560
Look,

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.280
just send her a WeChat,

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.280
tell her to accept my friend request.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.520
I already explained

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.520
everything to her, crystal clear.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.200
I'll pull up the screenshots for you.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:47.920
I...

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.200
Stop nagging me, please.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.280
Whatever you want to say,

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.960
I've already said it to her,

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.520
okay?

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:55.480
Just wait,

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.600
I'll forward it to you.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.800
Don't hang up.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.760
See?

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.000
What did I tell you?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Isn't everything spelled out?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.040
Any problem with that?

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.320
Super clear, right?

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.520
So there.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.680
Tell her

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.720
to go check on her mother.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.800
You're so unbelievable.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.960
I'm already drowning in work

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.800
and I still have to... Hold up,

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.600
I've got another call coming in.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.160
One sec.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.760
Hello, Liu Bo?

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.600
[You finally picked up.]

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.280
[Get to the office, quick.]

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.040
[Mr. Chang]

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.000
[is heading out later,]

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.240
[so he moved]

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:24.680
[the meeting up.]

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.360
[You're about to miss it.]

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.080
Okay, okay.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:29.720
[Hurry.]

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.400
Got it, I know, I know.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.520
Okay, sure.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.280
[Can you make it in 20 minutes?]

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.600
Twenty minutes is plenty.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.440
I'll be there.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:37.560
Just you wait.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.880
I'll sprint in nineteen,

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.080
you'll see.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:40.760
On my way.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.040
I'm on my way.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:43.880
Zhang Ran?

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.760
Where's my

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.080
blue striped tie?

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.160
Zhang Ran?

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:52.680
Zhang Ran?

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.680
You're staying there forever?

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.040
My sister and brother-in-law

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.960
literally have nowhere to live.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.400
They...

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.440
They can stay with us.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.640
They can't stay here forever.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.200
With a new place,

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.160
you've got to keep the decor bright.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.240
Sir,

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.160
the paint on the two sides of this wall

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.280
looks a bit different.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.200
You'll need to match it

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.080
to the color card properly.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.280
Okay, sure.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.160
It shouldn't look patchy...

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.240
Xinying, what are you doing here?

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:56.800
Did you

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.520
leave something behind?

00:23:59.200 --> 00:23:59.480
Come on,

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.920
let's talk inside.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.960
Don't let the paint splatter on you.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.320
Come.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.960
This is my son's wedding flat.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.520
We're redoing it for him.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.000
When I was cleaning,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.360
I saw how neatly your parents

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.400
had packed up.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.840
They shouldn't have left anything.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.440
Wedding flat? What do you mean?

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.320
Your parents

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.640
sold this place to me ten years ago.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.320
They said you were going abroad

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.320
and needed to buy a place over there,

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.440
so...

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.160
They didn't tell you?

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.480
But they've been living here

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.200
this whole time.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.280
They rented it

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.200
back from me.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.160
So basically,

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.440
they hid all of this from you.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:08.720
Come here,

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.360
you little rascal.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.560
Don't move.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.280
Well, let me see.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.160
Step out.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.480
Let's see.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.800
One meter twenty-six.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.120
You know

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.000
how much food you've eaten

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.120
to get there?

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.040
What have you been sneaking on the side?

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.360
How tall do you think

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.320
you'll grow?

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.360
As tall as you.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.080
That tall?

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.240
Time flies, doesn't it?

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.080
Those six years

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.920
I spent in Canada with Xinying

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.040
feel like

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.480
they were just yesterday.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.280
Those six years?

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.280
From the day you had Xinying till now

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.080
doesn't feel that long to me either.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.360
But seriously, sis,

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.760
during my postpartum period,

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.600
thank you for

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.480
taking such good care of me.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.400
Did I hear that right?

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:36.920
Have you forgotten

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.360
how many times you've made me cry?

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.240
So bad.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.600
Who else would I even mess with?

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.280
You're my own sister!

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.080
And you think you're right?

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.080
Think about it,

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.160
we're almost twelve years apart,

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.560
but can talk about anything.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.400
Whenever I talk to you,

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.240
every word comes from the heart.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.880
But Xinying

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.840
and Ran...

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.520
Do you think either

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.120
of those two

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.200
has ever told us the truth?

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.240
Kids these days…

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.760
Who knows.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.480
Hard to figure out.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.040
What?

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.680
I just saw you

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.040
putting the bad parts inside too.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.360
Look at you!

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.680
Isn't that wasteful?

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.600
It's not that.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.600
You could've left them out first.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.440
Just pick them

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.200
out again

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.400
after washing.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.760
That's all it took.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.080
I'm trying to help you,

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.200
and all I get is blame.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:40.360
See?

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:41.960
You were saying stuff

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.120
that moved me a little,

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.120
and now you're at it again.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.200
You're never satisfied.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.960
Don't throw the bad parts inside.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.680
Put them over here.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.800
Seriously, how is Jianbin

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.880
supposed to live with you?

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.280
He'd thank his lucky stars.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.200
Really.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.000
Have some soup. I made it for you.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.440
I'm full.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.760
Eat some meat.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.360
Fat helps keep healthy.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.920
Here, take this lean piece.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.680
I'm really done, Jianbin.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.280
I'm full.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:19.720
She can serve herself.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.360
Just let her be.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.640
Here you are.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.640
Start showing your love

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.680
right in front of my sister?

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.440
You're never

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.400
this nice normally.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.400
This is what I get for being nice.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.960
Fine, I'll eat it.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.360
I'm done.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.600
Take your time.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.160
No need to clean up.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.240
I'll do it later.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:36.760
It's fine.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.040
Lu Ming

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.400
drives a cab every day,

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.960
and often works into early hours.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.000
Quite hard.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:47.960
Ailing,

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.200
you gotta tell Lu Ming

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.600
not to work so hard.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.360
Drowsy driving easily leads to accidents.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.160
It's good he's out working.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.560
Better than annoying me at home.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.880
Tell him to come home early today.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.320
Let's have dinner together.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.920
He never eats well when he's out.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.320
Get Lu Ming over here.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.160
We can have a drink together.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.040
A drink? You'd be the happy one.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.840
How can he work after drinking?

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.920
Then forget it.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.560
Exactly. Why work after drinking?

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.520
Just chill.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.360
Work hard, play hard.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.920
Have some soup.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.280
Nah, it's chicken soup.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:32.880
No, no, no.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.720
Just call him.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.360
See what time he'll be home.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.360
I won't.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.560
He's not a child.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.120
When it's time,

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.440
he knows to come back for dinner.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.840
He's not the same as before.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.320
Stop nagging him all the time.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.840
Show him more care.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.320
It's not easy being a cab driver.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.440
We're working our

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.600
asses off every day.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.160
Do the kids even appreciate it?

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.400
That's their business.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.000
Just do your own things well.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.680
TV shows

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.640
those old folks

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:10.840
are doing great.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.320
Live your own life.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.880
We shouldn't compare.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.040
Others live well

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.880
because they've got the means.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.360
Not like us, barely scraping by,

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.400
can't even hold onto a place to live.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.200
Don't bring up the house.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.960
Doesn't the house in Canada count?

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.720
You really think

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.680
it's only called "having a house"

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.560
if you own many here?

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.120
Think about it.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.080
It's pretty nice.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.560
You can live down south

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.680
or up north whenever you want.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.680
Pretty free and easy.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.960
Just get a job.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.600
So you stop overthinking all day.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.680
I'm not overthinking.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.400
You know,

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.280
I've thought this through.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.920
Lu Ming

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.600
lost his job

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.800
and didn't tell me right away.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.920
Xinying came back from abroad

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.720
and didn't tell me either.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.280
But they

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:09.920
were in touch.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.840
Lu Ming didn't tell me

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.280
means he still cares about me.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.080
I should listen to you.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.840
I need to show him some care.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.920
Or over time,

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.600
I'll push him

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.760
closer to Lu Xinying instead.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.920
Am I right?

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.440
You're such a smart one.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.440
That's right.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.680
I'm texting him right now

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.640
to show

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.840
my care for him.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.400
Yes, send it.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.880
Xinying says

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:53.800
she's coming over.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.240
You sure?

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.000
When she gets here,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.240
don't nag her, okay?

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.480
Hurry! I'm preparing more dishes.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:20.640
It doesn't work.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.800
Take care of my shirt!

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.200
What the hell's going on?

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.960
Stop moving.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:25.600
Keep moving

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.560
and you'll burn

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.400
out the motor!

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.320
I don't care about that.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.760
My shirt's still caught in there!

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:32.520
Hey!

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.240
Easy.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:33.880
Slow down!

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:34.200
Come on.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.040
Quick.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.000
Lift the bottom!

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.440
What happened?

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.600
You broke my wheelchair.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.680
You're paying for it!

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.880
No way.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.040
You're paying for my shirt!

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.480
My daughter brought

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.240
it from overseas.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:45.880
An expensive one.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.080
It's worth two of your wheelchairs.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.480
This wheelchair came from overseas too.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.480
Not cheap either.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.280
Watch your mouth!

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.200
As if!

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.560
Your wheelchair just

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.920
caught my shirt.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.440
Quit messing around.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.080
Pay for my shirt first!

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:01.560
Uncle.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.040
Uncle!

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.720
Oh, you're here.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.000
Just here to see my mom about something.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:13.639
She's upstairs with your aunt.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:14.880
Uh…

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.520
Thank you for everything these days.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.239
We're family.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:21.080
To get you guys

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.280
back together,

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.000
I've talked a lot to your mom.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:25.560
I know.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.719
I've been thinking many ways,

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:27.800
and even can't sleep at night.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.920
Look how thin my hair's gotten!

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:29.880
Let me tell you...

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:31.199
It's all because of your family's mess.

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:32.840
Uncle, I'm gonna see my mom first.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:36.880
Xinying!

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.400
Don't tell your aunt

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.719
I'm helping fix the wheelchair.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.719
She'll be pissed.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.440
Take it slow.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.760
Good peppercorns.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.360
The flavor is super strong.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:54.840
Yeah.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.120
Enough?

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:57.960
That's enough.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.800
No need to add more?

00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.560
Nah, it's good.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.760
Don't add too many ingredients.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.440
Alright, alright.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.080
Seal it up.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.040
More water.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.480
Almost ready.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.680
I'll go.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.280
I'll get it. Sit.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.360
I'll get it.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.160
Auntie.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.720
Xinying, come in.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.640
No need to change shoes. It's fine.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.640
We were just talking.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.320
It's all over now.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.360
It's nice

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.880
having your mom live here.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.120
The house thing isn't a big deal.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.480
They just want the best for you.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.320
You're here.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:42.480
Alright.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.280
Have a seat.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.760
Aren't you sitting?

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.880
I've got something to do.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.160
Mom…

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.040
Ran called me the other day

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.320
and told me to come home.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.480
So I went back,

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.160
and found out

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.480
the house had been sold.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.200
I know how much you and dad

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.720
have done for me

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.640
since I was little,

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.440
sending me abroad to study,

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.880
and buying a house there.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.520
I won't let you end up homeless

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.760
when you're old.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.000
I really hope

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.120
you can have your own life

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.440
and live well.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.000
We're happy to do

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:29.880
anything for you.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.640
Actually,

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.880
I reflect on myself too.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.080
Nobody's perfect, right?

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.240
I think there are some issues

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:39.880
that I

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.960
need to work on myself.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.440
I won't put much pressure

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.280
on you two.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.760
Actually, I'm not

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.640
an unreasonable mom.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:51.920
Right?

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.800
If you have anything to say,

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.680
just tell me.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.520
I'll work on

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.040
my own problems.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:01.640
But mom, I…

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.400
Every time I try to talk to you,

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.160
you just

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.440
push back

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.400
and yell at me.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:06.760
And then…

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.880
Not every time…

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.040
Fine.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.840
The reason I came today is...

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.800
to tell you something.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.240
You know

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.440
I can't go back to Canada, right?

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.120
We really should wrap this up.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:29.640
Here…

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.200
I sold the house

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.600
in Canada.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.520
And...

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.240
All taxes and fees are paid.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.080
The money is on this card.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.240
I've converted it all to RMB.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:41.840
If you'll make

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.160
any big payments,

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.440
just take my ID

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.480
and this power of attorney

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.440
to the bank.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.120
If they need me in person,

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.680
just call me.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.680
I'll come right away.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:51.600
Okay?

00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:58.720
What do you mean?

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.240
Nothing.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.280
I just want

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.640
you and dad to have your own life,

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.320
and stop

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.560
devoting yourselves

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.760
to me every day.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.120
You've done it since I was a kid.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.080
So you sold

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.720
our house

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.080
in Canada?

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.720
Did your dad know?

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:27.760
He didn't.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.720
You didn't tell him

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.560
and me.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.320
You just

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.200
made the decision

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.600
and sold it!

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.160
Yeah, I did it.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.760
It's because I want you

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.800
to have a good life,

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.720
not to stay at other people's houses.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.240
Mom,

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.320
please stop running around for me.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.600
Stop obsessing over

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.000
this Canada thing.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.120
Let's just breathe for once.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.160
Stop struggling

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.040
in that thing.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.640
Okay, mom?

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.080
How could you have

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.120
the guts to do this?

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.040
Did you say even one word to me?

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.040
We sold the old house,

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.120
bought this one,

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.320
and put it in your name.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.720
But literally this house

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.880
is years of our hard work.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.160
Again and again,

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.040
you hide everything

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.200
from me!

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.680
Do you even see me as your mom?

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.680
Have you thought about me?

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.560
You're always forcing me

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.840
to do things I don't want to!

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.640
What do you want to do?

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.560
Tell me!

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.840
You just wanna live it up all day!

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.600
Never!

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.520
All I want

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.880
is to live my own life!

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:56.920
Let me ask you...

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.200
Your own life?

00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.920
What kind of life?

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.720
I don't want to be

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.480
- on top like you!
- Can you ever live

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.080
with self-respect on your own?

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.520
I just don't want

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.600
the life you planned for me, okay?!

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.400
So I am wrong to

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.520
plan your life, huh?

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.200
Then am I wrong

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.520
to live my own life?

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.080
Ever since I was little,

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.120
I've just been following the path

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:19.840
you laid out for me.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.720
Piano lessons,

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.840
and Canada...

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.320
Did you ever ask me

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.640
whether I like this?

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.040
Listen, Lu Xinying.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:27.880
You'll

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.280
be a mother one day.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.560
What does it mean to be a parent?

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.320
What do you like?

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.840
Tell me, what do you like?

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.240
Kids like to eat,

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.200
drink,

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.200
sleep,

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.160
and have fun.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:44.920
What if they grow up?

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.400
What if you're

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.960
middle-aged?

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.360
Who's gonna give you your dignity?

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.080
Who's gonna give you security?

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.840
Do you think I enjoy

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.120
living this rootless life?

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.160
Mom, I really can't

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.080
get through to you.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.880
I can't get through to you either.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.120
All I know is

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.760
I gave everything I had

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.400
and raised a kid

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.360
who argues with me like this.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.240
I'm not arguing with you.

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.520
I just want you and dad

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.160
to have a real home,

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.600
a proper place to live.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.480
I want you two

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.320
to live your own life.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.960
Stop worrying about me so much.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.120
I want my own life too!

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.040
You used to be my whole life.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.200
And now you make me realize

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.920
I'm a complete failure.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.840
Think about it.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.240
What did I ever do wrong?

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.400
I keep correcting myself,

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.080
again and again.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.520
I'm only making it worse!

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.400
Mom, what did I do wrong?

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.760
Is it your mom's fault?

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.400
Stop worrying about you?

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.760
What else do you want?

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.560
Listen up, she's your mom,

00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.520
and my sister!

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.520
You don't care about her, but I do!

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.800
How can you treat her like this?

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.600
What could you

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.160
pay back?

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.600
Mom, I'm done talking.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.800
You think it fixes everything?

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:10.840
I put it here.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.120
Mom, whether to buy this house

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.120
depends on you.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:14.960
I'm leaving.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.440
Auntie, I'm so sorry.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.400
Is "I'm sorry" enough?

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.360
Stop right there!

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.280
Take it back.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.600
I didn't raise you all these years

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.680
for the money.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:30.760
Get out!

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.320
You bastard!

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.560
Bastard!

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.520
What a bastard!

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.440
Can't believe it.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.400
She makes me feel I'm a failure.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.000
Sis…

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.360
I'm okay.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.080
I'm fine.

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.120
Did you argue with her?

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.320
Get out!

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:05.960
If it were Zhang Ran,

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.680
I'd slap her across the face.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.440
Heartless person.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.080
Close the door!

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.480
No shame at all?
