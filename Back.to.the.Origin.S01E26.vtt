00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.759
Lady Wan,

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.160
do you think this will work?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.960
I think

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.440
it might.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.880
You sure?

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.520
Let me think about it. I need a moment.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.000
It's urgent.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.960
I think it...

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.920
will work.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.040
[Hello, you must be Mr. Li?]

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.960
Hello, hello.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.120
I'm the business development manager.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.960
Not at all.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.560
Please sit.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.280
We received the cooperation inquiry

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.880
from your business department.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.640
Yes.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.440
We already replied.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.200
I know, I know.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.800
Here's the thing.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.360
I'm the COO

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.040
of Dr. Fu.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.720
I personally put together

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.840
a company profile

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.600
and a proposal.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.560
I was hoping to speak

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.360
with Lady Wan

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.880
face-to-face,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.200
to see if there's

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.760
a chance we could

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.640
work together.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.360
Ms. Wang, Lady Wan has arrived.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.040
The meeting's about to start.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.720
Got it.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.520
I see...

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.920
but I have a standing meeting.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.800
Yes, I understand.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.680
Leave the materials.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.320
I'll bring them up during the meeting.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.320
Really?

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.640
Thank you so much.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.079
Sorry to trouble you.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.640
Thank you, seriously.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.280
On my way here this morning,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.600
my right eyelid kept twitching.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.000
Feels like something's

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.280
gonna go wrong today.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.160
Same here.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.640
Nothing's gone smoothly lately.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.520
Hello, Mr. Fu.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.320
Morning, Mr. Fu.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.280
Morning, sir.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.400
Mr. Fu spent the night at the office?

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.000
Yeah.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.760
Mr. Fu!

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.159
My dear Mr. Fu!

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.480
Sit, sit. Just sit.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.360
You and Daoqi are truly amazing.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.560
Absolutely incredible work.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.320
You pulled

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.840
off the impossible!

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.720
If we can partner with Lady Wan,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.600
our product is

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.159
already halfway to success.

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.440
A round of applause for Mr. Fu!

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.680
I just found out about this myself.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.320
Daoqi!

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.960
Let's make the applause even louder!

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.920
Was this you?

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.080
Mr. Li, tell us,

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.080
how did you two make it happen?

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.120
[It all started at a car wash.]

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.720
[Staring at the soap]

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.960
[bubbles sliding down the windshield,]

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.080
[I came up with 13 strategies.]

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.400
[I finally picked the first one.]

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.680
Got it.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.880
Lady Wan, I'm coming to see you.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.800
[This time,]

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.920
[it's impossible for her to say no.]

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.120
Hello.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.320
Mr. Li.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.520
Hello, hello.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.400
This is the proposal

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.320
we prepared.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.200
Then...

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.400
Let's talk in the car.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.240
Sure.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.960
Be serious.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.960
Was what you just said true?

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.080
Didn't I signal you

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.159
when I walked in?

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.640
You missed that?

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.240
What good is

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.040
signaling me then?

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.920
If you wanted me to play along,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.120
you should tell me ahead of time.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.360
You made me look

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.320
like an idiot.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.920
How is that okay?

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.440
Relax. You didn't look stupid.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.720
We were totally

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.760
in sync just now.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.040
But that Michael,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.960
I have to say,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.120
he drives me crazy.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.080
Whatever I say,

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.000
he contradicts.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.400
Feels like

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.560
he has it out for me.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.920
Let it go, man.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.400
You already crushed

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.480
Michael today.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.760
And Xing Kai even spoke up for you.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.520
Don't push it.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.440
Also,

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.560
what's going on

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.560
with you and Lady Wan?

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.720
Don't mess around.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.560
Otherwise, I'm telling

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.400
Cheng Man.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.000
Mess around?

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.760
Sure,

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.440
I indeed

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.400
exaggerated a bit

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.640
just now,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.520
but I did

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.159
put in serious effort.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.400
Tell me the truth.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.000
This is top level business intel.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.720
I'm only telling you

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.600
because you're my buddy.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.320
Please take a tissue.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:01.920
Thanks.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.960
Please take a tissue

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.920
to wipe your noble...

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.720
Lady Wan, hello.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.920
Let me introduce myself briefly.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.320
My name is Li Daoqi, and I'm from...

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.040
Get him out of here.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.560
Because our company

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.160
is a new...

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.880
Sir, sir, this way.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.600
Sir, please come this way.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.400
Take a tissue

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.360
and wipe your hands!

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.400
The elevator's over there.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.320
Okay.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.320
This way please.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:32.799
Alright.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:33.240
Maybe

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.120
I should return this pack

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.600
of tissues?

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.320
Just give it to me.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:35.799
Wait,

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:36.880
I took it from the men's restroom.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.799
It's fine. Please just leave.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:38.440
Okay.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.240
This way.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.880
Can you go in the men's restroom?

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.840
This way, sir.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.679
Alright, you can go back now.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.400
Okay.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.400
Sorry about that.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.360
It's fine. Just leave.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.080
Okay, I'm leaving.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.440
See? I'm going now.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.480
You're still here?

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.040
Okay, no worries.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.520
Wait, how do I go down?

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.760
Okay, I got it.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.040
I'm really leaving.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.920
Hello, everyone in the fan group!

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.720
I'm the newbie, Daoqi.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.760
I'm so excited today.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:08.920
I feel like

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.640
I finally found my people,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.080
my home,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.240
and where my heart belongs.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.320
I still have a lot to learn,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.120
and I hope you can

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.520
help me out.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.440
I've got

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.720
plenty of free time.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.680
If there are any events,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.720
please bring me along.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.720
Over here, attention.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.000
This one's a medium.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.680
Here you go.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.600
There's a large over here.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.000
[Where's the XL?]

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.640
XL...

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.160
Is this an XL?

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.000
[Today's event was]

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.800
[such a success.]

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.240
[Daoqi, you're incredible.]

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.240
[Why not make him]

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.800
[our fan club rep?]

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.640
[Great idea.]

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.400
Mei, what can I do for you?

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.880
[Hello, is this Daoqi?]

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:40.880
[Can you make it to]

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.000
[Lady Wan's event?]

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.960
Of course.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.120
[Perfect.]

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:45.960
[Here's the thing.]

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.360
[Lady Wan is attending]

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.200
[a movie premiere.]

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.120
[Her manager knew about]

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.160
[our fan T-shirts]

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.240
[and was thrilled.]

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:51.720
Okay.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.240
[They want us to come]

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.560
[and show support for Lady Wan.]

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.720
[As the fan club rep,]

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.640
[you have to come.]

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.280
No problem.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.200
Just

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.320
send me the time

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.000
and location.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.920
[Will do.]

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.920
See you then.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.240
[See you then.]

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.800
Lady Wan, I'm coming to see you.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:14.600
Lady Wan,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.080
this is a gift from your fans.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.400
The fan club

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.280
prepared...

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.400
Be careful.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.040
What are you doing?

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.560
I'm giving this to her.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.240
Sorry,

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.120
no entry without a staff pass,

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:25.560
okay?

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.400
Stop poking me.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:26.840
Quiet!

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.640
Staff pass.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.280
[Everyone just keep quiet!]

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:28.560
Hurry.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.640
[Quiet down!]

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.880
[Stop pushing! Careful!]

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.160
I have my pass.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.240
I just didn't bring it.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.040
I changed my pants.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.000
No pass, no entry.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.840
Here, here.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.080
Be quick.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.080
[Calm down!]

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.320
[Quiet!]

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.520
[Everyone calm down!]

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.440
[Ladies and gentlemen,]

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.280
[the film]

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.360
[Journey of Life is about to begin.]

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.560
[Please make sure]

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.280
[your phones are on silent.]

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.400
[Enjoy the movie.]

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.720
Excuse me.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.320
Sorry.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.440
Lady Wan, sorry to interrupt.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.880
You are?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.440
I'm a member of your

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.560
fan club.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.720
I'm here on behalf

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.080
of your fans to give you a gift.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.880
You don't remember me?

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.400
I handed you a tissue once.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.240
Tissue guy?

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.520
Yes, that's me.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.640
What do you want?

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.200
My name is Li Daoqi.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.320
Besides being your devoted fan,

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.640
I also run a domestic

00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.880
skincare brand

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.880
called Dr. Fu.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:03.720
Our...

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.920
Sorry, sorry.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.120
Though we're a domestic company,

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.200
our goal is to

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.000
rival top global brands.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.000
Domestic brands should also pursue excellence.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.800
I've followed your livestreams closely

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and noticed

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.400
domestic beauty brands

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.120
don't get

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.120
enough spotlight there.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.360
So I'm

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.000
planning a domestic

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.720
brands special.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.320
Really?

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.840
We're aiming for the same thing.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.160
That's the foundation for a partnership.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.600
If this movie weren't so boring,

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.200
I wouldn't have time for your nonsense.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.520
Yeah, right.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.480
This movie is terrible.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.920
Can you shut up?

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.560
Sorry. No more talking.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.280
Sorry. Sorry.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.280
Dr. Fu

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.600
isn't just a brand name.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.960
He's real.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.120
He's my childhood friend,

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.960
a chemistry PhD from a top university.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.320
He came back to start this business.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.200
Why are you taking so long?

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:25.560
Let's go.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.480
Wait, my leg's numb.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.360
Slow down.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.000
There are samples in the bag.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.560
[I know, I know.]

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.440
My leg's numb.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.840
Stop pulling, okay?

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.000
You're disturbing others.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.200
My leg's numb.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.120
Samples. In the gift bag.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:41.920
Move.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.640
I know.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.480
Lady Wan

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.280
has also expressed

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.960
her gratitude to...

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.200
Lady Wan!

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.680
Lady Wan!

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.000
Thank you for the gifts.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:22.760
You're so thoughtful.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.440
I've received them.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.360
Thank you!

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.120
Lady Wan,

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.640
could you sign for us?

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.320
Quick, the pen!

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.240
Sign here,

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:31.880
use my back.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:32.960
Lady Wan,

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.840
our fan T-shirts were

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.480
all made by him.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.880
He's the newest super-fan.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.360
Thanks for your work.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.640
Not at all.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.720
Take your time.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.800
I'm talking about Dr. Fu.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.360
Wanna join my livestream?

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.400
You'll need real strength.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.640
Can you stick it out until the end?

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.880
No problem.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.080
Definitely.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.320
Good.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.240
My team will reach out

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.160
to you later.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:52.680
Okay.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.960
Alright, thank you all.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.080
Thank you.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.200
Thank you very much.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.080
Thank you.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.520
Thanks.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.480
Thanks.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.400
Mei, tell everyone

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:06.880
that

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.240
midnight snacks are on me.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.560
Nice.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.680
Guys,

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.800
Daoqi's treating us tonight!

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.000
Great!

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.880
Daoqi! Daoqi! Daoqi!

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.760
Daoqi! Daoqi! Daoqi!

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.320
[How could you do this]

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.120
[on your own?]

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.080
Bro,

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:28.800
come on.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.040
I threw away my pride to achieve this.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.360
Even if I'd dragged you with me,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.400
what could you have helped with?

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.240
Besides,

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:34.800
you seemed

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.320
out of it those days.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.520
I didn't want to add to your mess.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.280
How was I out of it?

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.240
Dude,

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.800
you've been sleeping at the office?

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.200
Is it because

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.520
I slipped up that day?

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.120
I thought she'd known it.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.000
My bad, my bad.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.319
It's fine, it's all over.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.280
You know,

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.640
I haven't gone home these days,

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.480
and she didn't even ask where I was.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.119
So you're waiting for

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.400
an excuse to go back?

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:19.800
Come on,

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.200
you're a grown man.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.560
Two days of sulking is enough. Go home.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.520
I will!

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.480
I can't shower here.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.680
I have to take a bath.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.200
You're really something.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.360
You're the most stubborn one I've known.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.240
Mr. Xing.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.680
Sorry,

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.760
I'm a bit slow.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.640
I didn't

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.680
quite catch

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.760
what you meant

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.680
in the meeting.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.280
I just

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.720
discussed it with

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.000
other executives.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.520
We all think

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.800
the company can't

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.640
carry the cost of Lady Wan's

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.680
livestream.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.560
Even if production keeps up,

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.040
any slip-up

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.360
during this process

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.080
could be

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.160
catastrophic for us.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.880
Of course I know that.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.040
So the company won't

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.280
give him full

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.360
financial support.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.120
[Since he's so eager]

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.120
[and driven,]

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.960
[he should pay the price]

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.800
[for that eagerness,]

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.440
[right?]

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.040
[If the trial livestream goes well]

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.920
and we sign with Lady Wan,

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.360
then Li Daoqi can go raise money

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.920
and scale production.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.000
If not,

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.480
the loss is on him,

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.800
and I'll have

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.840
every reason to remove him.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.000
Brilliant.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:51.920
I get it now.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.120
Sir,

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.520
I just have one more question.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.440
If things

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.640
really get to that point,

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.320
what about our products?

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.240
[What's the rush?]

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.000
Don't we still have markets

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.200
in third and fourth-tier cities?

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.560
Listen,

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.640
the company won't

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.520
suffer any losses.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.160
[Relax.]

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.440
[You must know that]

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.800
every choice cuts both ways.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:16.920
Why is Li Daoqi

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.400
pushing himself so hard?

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.760
Because he wants

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.280
to prove himself.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.360
[Right?]

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.800
[No need to crush his enthusiasm.]

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.640
[Let him have what he wants for now.]

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.120
Maybe we're all

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.560
underestimating him.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.280
He dares to gamble,

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.080
and he goes all in every time.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.200
The risk is high,

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.400
but

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.960
if he wins,

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.800
the payoff will be massive.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Yes, exactly.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.880
I'll prepare contingency plans.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.080
Trust me.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.560
[Also,]

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.880
[make sure]

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.640
he gets a bit

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.480
of encouragement.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.560
Got it. I'll give him a push.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.600
Okay.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.720
Book a restaurant for me.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.520
[Let me make an introduction.]

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.280
[This is Director Zhu,]

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.200
[a famous filmmaker]

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:21.960
we invited.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.120
Hello, Director Zhu.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:24.960
Hi, Director Zhu.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.360
Thank you.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.840
As for Lin Anran,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.040
- I'm sure you already know her.
- Right.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.520
Qian Dan, Vice President.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.280
Hello.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.440
Zhang Ran, our breakout star.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.480
Hi, Director.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.480
I used to be a host as well,

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.080
a financial talk show host.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:41.720
Nice to meet you.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.120
Director,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.720
do you have any thoughts

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.360
on our proposal?

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.880
I've flipped through it.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.040
Overall, I think it's

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:51.640
pretty solid.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.160
However, there's one issue.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.120
It's that

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.360
the two hosts'

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.800
audience demographics

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.320
might differ quite a bit.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.040
For instance, Anran

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.520
appeals more to

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.480
modern, independent women.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.680
While Zhang Ran

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.520
connects more with the mass-market.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.520
So how

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.680
can we pull these

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.520
two audiences

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.160
into one talk series?

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:11.880
That could be

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.080
a significant hurdle.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.120
Therefore,

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.560
my suggestion is

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.320
we produce a pilot episode first

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.920
to test the waters.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.000
I see. That's your take.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.960
You're being very cautious

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.680
and thorough.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:29.960
But we have

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.640
full confidence in both of them.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.480
Absolutely.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.920
But what about their

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.000
clashing styles?

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.360
Our current idea is

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.680
to frame it as a debate.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.280
By taking opposing stances,

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.440
each side attracting

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.480
their followers.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.280
Then, we stir up buzz

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.280
with various topics.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.200
Sounds good, Director.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.200
I think your plan

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.040
is excellent.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.520
Aligns with Mr. Lin's vision of the whole

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.400
being greater than the sum of its parts, right?

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.160
So, if everyone's

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.080
on board,

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.240
shall we set the theme for

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.040
the first episode

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.160
as "Besties"?

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.280
What do you all think?

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.000
I think it's great.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.040
And you?

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:09.680
No problem.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.480
The ops team provides full backup.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.480
I'm in.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.640
Zhang Ran?

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.440
Personally, I have no issue.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.640
I just want to clarify

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.840
the boundaries for this topic.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.000
How edgy can we get?

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.920
As edgy as possible.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.760
It must be buzzworthy.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.240
But we must also cater to

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.920
the general audience's taste.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.520
If there are no further

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.480
objections,

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.440
let's proceed with this direction.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:34.640
Director,

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.440
I have an idea.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.920
I've been thinking

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.320
about how to be

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.520
contentious and

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.800
attention-grabbing.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.400
Could my co-host,

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.680
Xiaojian, play my "bestie"?

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.040
Well, he's a

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.520
comedy blogger,

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.360
so his style would actually

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.080
complement Zhang Ran's.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.080
My on-screen

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:55.960
persona

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.640
is more poised, while

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.200
the two of them can

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.200
bounce off each other.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:00.720
Is that okay?

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.280
Yes.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:01.680
Guys.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.040
I'll try out for you.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.800
Another reason is,

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.440
I'd like to give our

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.440
newcomers some exposure.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.680
Consider it

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.960
a bit of a selfish request.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.520
I think it works.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.520
Thoughts?

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.080
As long as it delivers,

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.160
I don't mind.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.160
It's up to you,

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.320
the leads.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.560
So, you mean

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.800
Xiaojian would be

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.560
your "bestie"?

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.040
Yeah.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.720
Then wouldn't I have to

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.840
find a new "bestie"?

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:35.560
Yes.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.840
The theme is "Besties".

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.160
You'll be needing one.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.000
Director, let me explain.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.480
Zhang Ran

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.600
lived abroad for a long time.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.960
Her close friends are likely all overseas.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.240
They probably can't make it here.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.160
True, but I could

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.040
try...

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.200
It's fine. I'll think about it.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.320
I think it

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.240
doesn't have to be

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.600
a real best friend.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.040
Anyone that can vibe with you

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.000
and create

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.640
good TV, will work.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.720
A real one'd be ideal,

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.360
no doubt.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.040
You're so likable.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.200
Surely you can find

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.240
someone.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.920
You have a point.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.960
I... I do have a

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.120
colleague from my

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.640
TV hosting days.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.400
I could ask her

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.720
if she's interested.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.800
What kind of host?

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.040
I'm concerned a traditional

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.520
TV station host

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.240
might not mesh with

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.080
our show's younger,

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.600
more internet-savvy vibe.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.800
But Zhang Ran here

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.480
was a host too, right?

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.400
Yes, I hosted a finance show.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.480
It's okay, Zhang Ran.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.040
Figure it out later.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.400
No problem, will do.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.600
Okay.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.240
So, the framework

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.080
for our show

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.200
is basically set.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:45.880
Let's go with it.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.080
Give it our best!

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:47.640
Yes! Let's go!

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.400
Let's do this.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.200
Thanks, Director.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.040
Thank you.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.640
Hey, what about your cousin?

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.640
She's in town, right?

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:54.840
Could we

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.680
invite her over?

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.680
She's not an influencer,

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.480
has a story, and you're family.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.200
She's got her own problems

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.040
weighing her down right now.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.040
Let's not bother her.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.280
Besides, there's a ten-year gap.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.400
We're not even that close.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.520
Not as close as you and I.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.440
Anran snagged Xiaojian,

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.680
so the "guy bestie" angle

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.560
is taken.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.120
We could've done that.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.680
This "dual female lead" thing

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.080
is just for show.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.840
We're just the cameo.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.720
This is how it's gonna be from now on.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.920
We get their leftovers.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.400
So we better

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.360
get used to it.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.200
What do we do, then?

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.440
Actually,

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.000
any streamer will do.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.480
Look, it's variety show.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.080
Write a script, stir up some drama,

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.200
and boom—you've got clicks.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.120
Right?

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.440
This industry is such a cesspool.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.720
Look at what it has done

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.360
to my good old lad Liu Bo.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.040
Is that a compliment

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:47.960
or mockery?

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.040
Clearly, that's a

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:50.760
mockery.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.600
Okay.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.680
Good grief.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.240
Listen, I...

00:25:59.240 --> 00:25:59.720
Stop it.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.760
That's not what she meant.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.040
♪Where oh where is my bestie?♪

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.800
♪Where can they be?♪

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.440
♪They are...♪

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.400
We're so useless at this.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.320
Should I just have

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.560
Fu Yudong throw on a wig?

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:23.960
Good.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.040
A toast, everyone?

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.040
Hold on, Mr. Xing.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.000
May I have the

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.400
honor of toasting Mr. Li alone first?

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:30.960
By all means.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:31.720
Mr. Li.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.880
It just dawned on me now.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:34.880
I used to be

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.760
this frog in a well.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.200
Just as you said,

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.960
your vision is up here,

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.080
mine was down here.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:41.880
A far cry from yours.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.880
Nah. We're all here.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.080
I am truly, truly in awe.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.680
Alright, a penalty drink for me.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.120
You don't...

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.360
I'll join you for that one.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.320
I got it. Let me.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.360
No.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.040
I'm having one with Michael.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:51.920
Cheers.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.200
Thanks.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.240
Thank you, Mr. Li.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.440
We're off to a flying start.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.760
Mr. Li?

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:02.920
Now we need to

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.840
ace the pilot and lock down

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.720
Lady Wan's sponsorship fee.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:08.760
Double down on that.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.720
Our top priority right now

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.600
is to make a big splash with the launch.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.760
There'll be challenges, sure.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:16.960
But

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.960
you know what?

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.560
Leave it to me.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.560
Now that's what I'm talking about!

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.200
Right?

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.200
Let me top you up.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.920
No shop talk when we're drunk.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.480
Who's drunk? I'm fine.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.080
Come on, bottoms up!

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.120
I'm on it.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:32.840
He can drink.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.080
Yudong, I saw a fortune teller

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.920
the other day, you know?

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.560
Said this is my year to shine.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.320
Isn't that the status quo?

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:42.880
Watch your tongue.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.400
Mr. Li is our good luck charm.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.480
Isn't him, Mr. Xing?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.320
Forget those psychics. I'll do it.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.720
Give me the cash instead.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.480
Deal.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:50.880
Here.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.120
Come on.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:52.960
Mr. Fu.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:53.960
Cheers.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.400
Alright, down the hatch!

00:27:59.200 --> 00:27:59.800
Guess I'll be

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.720
under the table soon.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.760
Another bottle.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.840
Sure thing.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:03.320
No problem.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.080
Waiter!

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.920
We'll take another bottle.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.720
[Right away, sir.]

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.080
This way, Mr. Xing.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.320
All taken care of.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.200
Listen,

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.840
the buzz tonight is just right.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.600
Take care, Mr. Xing.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.160
Alright.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.600
Goodnight, Mr. Xing.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.440
Take care.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.960
Bye. Easy does it, now.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.880
Watch your step.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:21.760
Don't worry.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.840
I'll see Mr. Xing home.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.840
Bye, Mr. Fu, Mr. Li.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.920
See you, Michael.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.000
Bye.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.920
Come on, I'll get you home.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.160
I got a designated driver. It's alright.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.160
I told you to take it easy.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.160
You wouldn't listen.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.720
I was drinking 'cause I'm happy.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.720
As if.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.520
Those scams

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.320
tried to set you up.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.280
Couldn't you tell?

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.480
Let them.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.440
Let 'em try.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.880
How far can they get?

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.760
You and me together,

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:54.960
we'll clear

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.240
any hurdle they set.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.840
No sweat.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.600
Rest assured, bro.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:02.880
Smile for me.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.960
You've been glum all day.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.720
Come on, smile.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.480
Bug off.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.000
Smile. Come on.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.200
Give me a smile.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.120
Get those dirty hands

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.120
of yours off my face.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.440
I'll pinch you with that claw!

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.600
Wow. That's a claw!

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:16.640
Thought

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.280
it was a human leg.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:19.720
Real deal.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:20.800
Hands off!

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.840
You'll knock it over.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.120
Remember how we used to be?

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.280
A couple of doormats.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.040
But starting now,

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.560
we're these two giant claws.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.240
Seriously.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.160
Unstoppable. A pincer movement.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.040
We'll be rolling in dough! Rolling in it!

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.600
Money, money, money!

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.400
Move!

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.080
Take me home.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.000
Let's go home, you and me.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.360
Psycho.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.240
♪We're going back♪

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.120
♪To the sea...♪

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.920
When I make it big,

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.200
I'll make a movie about us

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.200
legendary upstarters,

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.400
called "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea".

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.040
Open wide! Here I come!

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.120
Crabs walk sideways, man.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.000
Sideways!

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.520
They don't walk straight, dude...

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.760
Apes walk straight.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.400
How much have you had?

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.560
Today we landed

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.360
Lady Wan.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.560
You should've seen

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.920
Xing Kai and Michael's faces.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.680
That felt classic.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.240
We showed them.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.040
Stop frowning.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.040
Tell me I did good.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.640
You're the best, honey.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.280
The very best.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.840
Trust me, babe.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.560
One day,

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.520
I'll become the man

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.480
you truly...

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.080
I believe you. I do.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.840
Shh, that's enough.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.000
Here, let me wipe your face.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.080
You're home.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.440
Still up?

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.320
Yeah.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.520
Sorry about the stink. Had a few drinks.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.520
So,

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.840
Daoqi landed a deal

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.760
with Lady Wan.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.360
We all went out tonight

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.120
to celebrate.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.640
That's great. Good for you.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.240
You're cooking with gas.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.480
Thanks.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.480
Sure.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.320
Your phone.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.280
Hello?

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.360
He seemed okay

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.200
when I left him.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.040
Okay.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:29.800
Who was it?

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.560
Cheng Man.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.640
Said Daoqi had too much to drink.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.880
Asked me to keep an eye on him.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.360
We should have her over sometime.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.560
Let's get together more.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.960
I thought you didn't like her.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.120
You and Daoqi are partners.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.080
You're in this deep.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.040
Perhaps you'll soon

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.600
become a big-shot duo.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.080
As the wives, we should

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.600
probably get to know each other.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.720
Maybe I could learn from her

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.200
about being more supportive.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.120
We'll see.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.440
You've got a lot on your plate.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.840
I'm hopping in the shower.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.680
This has been broken for ages.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.600
Fixed.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:18.920
Go get some rest.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.199
Come here.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:22.960
Good job. That's it.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.320
They're literally feasting!

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.159
We only get staff slop.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:30.000
They get as much fruit as they want.

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:35.000
Save some for me, buddies.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.239
Start by misting it down.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.239
Get it nice and clean.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.360
That's good. Okay.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.199
Then take the squeegee

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:54.080
and give it a pass.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.680
If the turtle tries to

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.320
eat something nasty,

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.280
let me know.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.800
On it right now.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.320
Don't let it swallow, then.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.200
It's no good for them.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.080
Will it bite me?

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.800
No. Just don't go near its head.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.000
That kangaroo in the back?

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.440
Give it some space

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.120
when you're

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.000
working around.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.680
This one's tame.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.400
That one's got a temper.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.000
Alright.

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.400
That's all from last week.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.520
Same old issues.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.440
Let me make this clear.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.720
"Own your responsibilities" isn't just a slogan.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.880
We have protocols.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:06.880
Also...

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.400
Ge Kaiyang. Are you with me?

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.600
You're on the night shift starting today.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:13.960
5 PM

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.000
to 5 AM.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:15.840
Alright?

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.840
Supposed to be Zhang, who

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.720
just became a father

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.400
and has to be home.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.800
Others, either older,

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.040
or have kids with

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.040
big exams coming up.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.840
They can't cover it.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.880
You're young, energetic,

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.240
and still in training.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.040
Working different shifts

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.000
helps with your growth.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.600
You can fit in better

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.880
with the team too.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.600
Here you are.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.400
Eyes off. It's mine.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.200
What are you doing over there?

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.360
Just shove that cot

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.040
in the gap.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.280
Idiot.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.240
The middle one's yours.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.000
Upper one.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.760
What are you gawking at?

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.160
Dumbass.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.840
Why are you all alone?

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.920
Everyone else has somewhere to crash.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.320
Why don't you?

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.240
Getting picked on,

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:48.920
just like me?

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.520
Let me see if I can get this off.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.800
Does it hurt?

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.160
I'm sorry.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.560
I can't help you.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.240
They picked on me.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.320
I didn't speak up.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.040
When I'm away,

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.240
Happy will be with you, Grandma.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.640
Don't worry about me.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.920
I've been talking to animals a lot lately.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.920
They are simpler than people.
