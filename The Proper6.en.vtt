WEBVTT

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.370
Come to think of it, his name's almost the same as Hiro's.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.040
And the way he loves gardening...
They're so alike...

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.920
Wait...

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.830
Don't tell me... Hiro is Suzuki Hiromu?

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.160
Of course not.
Don't compare me to a guy like that.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.330
You're right. You two are nothing alike.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.110
Sorry, my bad.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.950
- Hey.
- Yeah?

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.780
- Was he really your first love?
- Yeah.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.480
Suzuki!
Go buy us some bread!

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.650
Hurry! You've got ten seconds, go!

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.350
Here! Let me give you a face massage.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.130
Suzuki, your style is so lame.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.390
Look, I'll give you my favorite.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.230
- No, thanks.
- Don't be shy.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.130
See? Now we have matching ones.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.970
- Huh? Matching...?
- It's cute, isn't it?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.140
- Wear it to school tomorrow, okay?
- What?

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.880
You just have to water it, right?

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.920
Ah! Ah!
- Ha...!

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.530
Oh... Sorry, Suzuki.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.320
I'm sorry.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.730
To get closer to him,
I tried my best to strike up conversations.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.200
Then one time, when I planned to confess,
I asked him to meet me on the rooftop.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.110
Um... listen, I...

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.840
I have something important to tell you...

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.310
Huh?

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.490
- Natsuo, skipping class?
- Hey!

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.810
Samejima.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.950
Suzuki.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.280
Huh? Natsuo,
you needed him for something?

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.090
No... it's not like that...

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.060
- Hey!
- Ah...

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.520
Wait up!

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.320
He's a pretty interesting guy.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.190
Yeah...

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.860
But then our classmates showed up
and ruined everything.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.490
I couldn't just
confess in front of everyone, you know?

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.770
- Confess your feelings?
- Yeah.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.010
C-Confess your feelings?

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.500
Yeah.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.410
Confess your feelings?

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.930
I said yeah.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.870
Confess...

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.430
Huh...? Hiro?

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.850
Confess...

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.220
Are you okay?

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.930
What's wrong? What is it?

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.820
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.580
Alright, thank you.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.520
It's a little chilly,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.450
but that was amazing, as always!

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.360
Hiro-kun,
can you take one more picture?

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.960
I want to post it on social media.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.120
- Oh... uh, sure.
- Hiro-kun.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.680
Okay, say confess.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.050
Thanks.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.530
Confess...

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.710
- Huh?
- Confess...

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.380
Hiro-kun...?

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.380
Okay, so we'll see you tomorrow
at 2:00 PM.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.270
Right... confess.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.760
Huh, wait... hold on... "Confess?"
Huh? What do you mean?

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.560
Hello?
I'll take that.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.650
- Sorry about that.
- They already hung up...

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.840
- Oh...
- Thank you.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.070
- Mr. Ueda, thank you for waiting.
- Right.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.360
- How are we feeling?
- Ahh, that's so relaxing.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.810
- Please head over to the confession.
- The confession?

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.020
Huh? Did I just say "confess"?
Who...? Me? What? Who said that?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.220
Geez, what is wrong with you?

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.620
You're acting a little weird today, aren't you?

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.300
Sorry... A lot's on my mind.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.750
Then go rest in the back.
I'll handle this with Kiryu and Asahi.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.840
No, no, I'm fine, really.
I'll do it.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.920
- Ow, that hurts...!
- Wait... Hiro-kun?

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.240
Oh no, I really messed up...

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.690
- Ah...
- Are you okay?

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.480
"The Proper Way to Write Love"

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.510
(Episode 6: The Way to Hide a Wound (and Your Feelings))
What!? An injury?

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.200
Yeah, I just left the doctor's office and I'm heading home.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.230
Are you okay?

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.000
It's nothing serious.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.530
The doctor said it'll get better soon as long as I rest.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.530
I see.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.310
Yeah...

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.200
Agh...

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.480
Damn it...

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.970
Ugh...

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.870
Oh, Hiro.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.920
Are you okay?

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.950
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.150
But you're all bandaged up.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.580
Oh, no, it's fine.
Hiro, you just sit and rest.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.830
- It's okay, really.
- No, please, just relax.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.110
Um, is there something I can use to wipe this?

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.300
- Oh, yeah... under the sink...
- Under the sink...

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.530
on the second shelf.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.410
Second shelf... ah.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.970
- This one?
- Oh, yeah.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.010
Okay.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.460
Want some coffee?

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.980
Oof... oof...

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.950
I'll just move this out of the way, okay?

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.150
Oof.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.030
- Anything else?
- Um...

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.620
Anything else I need to do.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.500
Oh... In that case...

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.390
Could you go do some shopping for me?

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.860
Oh, shopping. Got it.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.620
- Get in touch with me later.
- Okay.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.930
You get some rest.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.920
I'm heading out.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.400
I'm home.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.070
Oh, you're back.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.700
- You're late.
- Yeah.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.660
I also picked up some things
I thought you might need.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.910
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.920
Hey, this is nice.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.210
The feeling of someone waiting for me.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.980
I haven't really experienced this before.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.380
Whoa, this is amazing.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.550
Ooh...

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.210
- There.
- Thanks.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:41.970
Mm.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.020
I wonder how it tastes.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.520
You're right.
This way, I can even eat with my left hand.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.860
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.890
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.550
- Mmm, delicious!
- Right?

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.920
- Having skewers at home is great, isn't it?
- Mmm.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.910
That was really nice.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.190
What you said earlier.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.500
Here.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.830
Hm?

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.610
Oh, it's nothing...

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.840
Mmm, this is good.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.430
- Is this okay?
- Yeah.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.050
- Here.
- Whoa.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.530
Ahh!

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.830
Mmm, delicious. This is great.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.720
- It's nice to eat with someone.
- Did I buy too much?

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.080
Are you serious?
Can I? Can I stay over?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.360
Yeah, it's already late.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.880
- Thanks!
- Hey.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.390
- Scoot over!
- Uh... okay.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.320
- Listen up. This is the dividing line.
- Okay.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.880
You are absolutely not to cross it.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.050
Also, you face that way when you sleep.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.460
- Hurry up.
- Yeah, I know...

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.490
- You're over the line!
- This is so cramped.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.830
- I'm about to fall off.
- Move over a little more...

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.470
Jeez...

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.030
It's nice, having someone next to me.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.570
Huh?

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.230
It's strangely comforting.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.240
(No. 118567 Washizawa Natsuo)

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.420
- Heh. Did something happen?
- Huh?

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.680
It's just that you seem different lately.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.220
- Do I?
- Yeah.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.320
You used to feel more artificial,
flawless, I guess you could say.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.910
Now you seem more human.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.950
You make mistakes, you get carried away.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.400
It's almost like you're in love.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.610
In love? No, no, no... How could I be in love...

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.430
Wouldn't that be a good thing for your work, too?

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.000
I'm telling you,
I'm not in love with anyone.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.080
Okay, okay, okay...

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.970
How are you feeling?
Is there anything else I can help with today?

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.610
Hiro! Wake up!

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.290
It's already seven.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.760
Hey, come on, get up.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.590
Mmm, what is it?
Ow, ow, ow...

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.760
I said it's already seven.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.170
Hey, Hiro.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.370
Here, open your mouth.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.760
How is it?

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.560
- Mmph...
- Hiro...

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.830
Hey... Are you okay?

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.670
Wait... Huh? Huh? Huh?

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:08.540
Hey, Hiro.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.450
Is it good?

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.220
- Mmph...
- Huh?

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.110
- Hiro.
- Hm?

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.240
Which one do you want?

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.600
Ah, this one.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.740
- Oh, this one?
- Yeah.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.550
Ahh, no, it's fine. I'll feed you.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.160
- I can eat it myself.
- Okay, okay.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.710
Ahh...

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.230
- Is it good?
- Delicious!

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.400
- Which one should I have, then?
- You want some?

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:33.130
Yeah.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.180
- Which one do you want?
- Hmm, the white one.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:35.660
Okay.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.360
Hey!

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.050
- There was only one white chocolate!
- Ah, sorry.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.190
So this is what he wears...

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.000
Natsuo, what are you doing...

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.650
- You're holding my underwear!
- Huh?

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.800
- Put it back!
- What's the big deal?

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.830
- And you're going through my... That's mine, too!
- Oh, you're so annoying.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.300
You're being so loud! That's enough!

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.600
All right, all right.
You're the injured one, after all.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.070
Just leave it to me.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.120
- Is that all? Anything else?
- Uh, is there more?

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.720
That's it.
Didn't you buy too much underwear?

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.230
Ah!

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.110
Hiro!

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.900
Wait for me!

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:34.900
Hiro.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.980
Hah!

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.820
Hey, Hiro!

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.370
Come on, get down here!

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.390
Hey, Hiro!
I said get down here.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.550
Hiro!

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.060
Hey, can you hear me? Hiro.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.830
Hiro!

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.850
Come on, get down here.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.910
Natsuo's bike is pretty cool, huh?

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:03.790
Hiro.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.410
- Hiro!
- Huh?

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.580
A flower...

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:11.740
Whoa...!

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.610
- This is amazing.
- Yeah.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.880
- It's so beautiful.
- I'm glad.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:26.880
If it starts to hurt, you have to tell me.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.740
Oh, okay...

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.310
Ah...

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.080
Um...

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.030
Mr. Suzuki, this is fine now.
You don't need to wrap it anymore.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:54.530
Try moving it a little.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.570
- No, a little more forcefully.
- More forcefully?

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:04.060
No problem. Treatment's over.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.030
No problem.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.420
I'm home!

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.220
Hiro! I brought back some beer.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.930
Huh?

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.400
You're here.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:38.030
- What the heck, so you were here, Hiro.
- Oh, you're back.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.840
I'm back.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.160
So, what did the doctor say? How is it?

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.900
It went well... Real well.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.990
I see.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.690
That's great!

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.560
Oh, right. I bought some beer.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.420
- Want some?
- Let's drink.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.370
I got four cans today.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.740
- Isn't that a bit much?
- Yeah, let's go.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.390
This is pretty funny.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.710
- Huh...?
- Ah...

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.140
- Hey, what's wrong?
- It's nothing, it's nothing.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.700
- Haha, this is fun.
- What is this? I've never seen one before.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.390
- Does it hurt?
- Oh, not at all.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.280
What is this thing?

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.990
- This is really something.
- Yeah. Heh.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.430
- It hurts...
- Natsuo!

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.250
Yes.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.170
Don't just stand there daydreaming!
That's dangerous!

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.020
- Sorry, boss.
- Seriously.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.050
- Hey.
- Oh, can I?

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.960
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.710
Ugh.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.520
You remember Kaburagi who used to work here?

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.060
Oh, yeah.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.550
- The guy broke a bone and needed surgery.
- Huh?

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:54.860
He thought it was just his pinky, nothing to worry about.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.590
Turned out to be a nasty break. I heard they put two metal plates in.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.140
So you need to be careful too.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.740
Right.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.810
- Metal...
- That's right, metal.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.480
But I don't know how they put them in.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:15.810
Wait... Wouldn't that hurt a lot?

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:17.720
Of course it hurts, you idiot. It's metal.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.730
It can't be...

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.280
It should be fine, right...?

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.490
Huh...?

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.770
- I'm back. You're home early.
- Yeah.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.100
- I used the spare key.
- Okay.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.690
Are you going shopping? If not, do you want to...

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.140
Aren't you all better now?

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.940
I was worried about you, so I stopped by the shop today.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:19.020
You've been looking so down lately.
I was concerned, so I went to the shop.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.960
Hey, why did you lie?

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.490
I didn't... intentionally lie...

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.360
Then you could have just told me you were better, couldn't you?

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:31.940
You made me worry.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.030
If I had told you...

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:40.250
If I had told you,

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.830
you would have gone back, right?

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:45.570
Huh?

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.530
I don't want that.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.570
I don't want you to go back...

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:00.790
Why?

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.870
You ask me why... How should I know?
I just don't, that's all.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.150
Hiro...!

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.180
I'm so glad.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.250
I'm so glad...

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:19.570
Huh?

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.350
I'm so glad... Hiro.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.100
I'm so glad, Hiro...

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.690
Who falls asleep at a time like this?

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.200
Don't tell me...

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.300
You haven't been sleeping well lately, have you?

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.130
Natsuo...

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.130
I... about you...

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.320
(Next time on: The Way to Deal with Your Past (The Nightmare).)
Ta-da! Washizawa Natsuo scores a spare key!

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.610
Come over whenever you want to see me.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.460
- You can even come by today.
- Today?

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.510
Don't tell me...
the person Hiro-kun likes is...?

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:49.240
- I'm going to a class reunion this Sunday.
- What?

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.420
- What for?
- There's someone I want to see.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.330
Who even goes to those things?

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.520
Don't tell me... it's Suzuki?
