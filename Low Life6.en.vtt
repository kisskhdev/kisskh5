WEBVTT

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.560
{\an8}She told me
not to contact you, but...

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:20.354
{\an8}how could I not?

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:23.023
{\an8}You should say goodbye
to her one last time.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.570
{\an8}She had tuberculosis.
We tried all sorts of things.

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:29.988
{\an8}A month of herbs and such.

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:32.074
{\an8}Three-beggar ticks and purslane.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:34.368
{\an8}All of it, shit.
None of it made a difference.

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:36.787
{\an8}Relax, where's the fire?

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.664
{\an8}Have a drink
and catch your breath.

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:40.874
{\an8}And how was it that you found me?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.921
{\an8}Well, the telephone company,
I called and asked,

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.131
{\an8}and they gave me
your new telephone number.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.262
"NOT DELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED RECIPIENT"

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:56.139
"SONG GITAEK
RETURNED TO SENDER"

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.767
Take it easy. Whoa, geez!

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.186
Is this deep enough?

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:04.231
Yeah, that'll do.
Just smooth it out now.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:05.691
Okay.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.530
Yeah, that's right.
That's Yejin's boy.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:18.912
So, how did you and Yejin end up meeting?

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:21.290
It was because of him.
That's how I met her.

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.127
Through Jecheon County Amateur Boxing.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.796
The kid I was coaching got sick
and couldn't fight.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.425
4TH JECHEON COUNTY MAYOR'S CUP
AMATEUR BOXING TOURNAMENT

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.469
Come on!

00:01:35.554 --> 00:01:36.555
Put 'em up!

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:45.188
Hey! Get him!
Uppercut! Uppercut, yeah!

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:48.567
Yeah!

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.572
Let's go, kid.
Let's get you some water.

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.826
You ready to get up there? Hmm?

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.619
Just try and focus on--

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:01.913
What's going on? You nervous or what?

00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:03.790
I must've ate something bad, Coach.

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:05.917
You gotta be more careful.

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:08.587
- Hey, Coach, I'm...
- What?

00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:11.298
- I don't think I can fight right now.
- Hey.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:13.467
Wait, c'mon, just...

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.095
Hey, how are you going to
pull your pants down

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:18.597
with the gloves on?

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.681
Oh, boy.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.267
Next fighter, blue corner. You're up now.

00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:25.103
Where's the fire?
Could you give us a minute?

00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:26.438
Should I disqualify him?

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:27.856
Ah, come on.

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:32.110
Maybe it's crazy...

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.281
Do you think I could
replace him for the fight?

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:47.334
There was just
something about the look in his eyes.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.252
Like he was a martial arts master.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.720
The kid had long limbs,
good reach, real grit.

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:04.393
So how'd it go?

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.401
That was his first time
in the ring.

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:15.153
One punch knocked him out.
I thought he died.

00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:18.073
- One. Two.
- He was up against a tough opponent.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.199
What?

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:21.159
Then I met his mom,
and one thing led to another.

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:23.745
He's a sweet kid.

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.124
Called me Dad right from the get-go.
He's got a good heart.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:31.044
But even still, seems like
he never really felt at home.

00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:32.295
{\an8}"5 YEARS LATER"

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.631
{\an8}He moved into the gym
after I married his mom.

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.342
With me in the house,
it was probably awkward.

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.721
I get it. It's not easy
living with a stranger

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.223
when you're a grown man.

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.152
I see a lot of empty bottles.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:56.695
He can really put it away.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.406
Eating and drinking, that's all he does.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.034
He's gone into debt over it.
That's how much he loves his vices.

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:15.672
So how old is Daesik now?

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:18.091
The boy is 26.

00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:20.760
His mother and I got married
around five years ago.

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.687
FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY,
STING LIKE A BEE

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:38.695
You...

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.656
You know who I am, don't you?

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.450
Yes.

00:04:45.327 --> 00:04:46.912
Then come live with me in Seoul.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.664
Okay.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.293
And from now on,
you need to stop drinking.

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:56.546
Yes, Father.

EPISODE 6, THE PLUNGE

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.161
All right, next diver.
Jeonchul, you're up now.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.999
You're fucking kidding me.
Are you serious?

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:16.710
Did you see what just happened?
And you want me to go in?

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:18.628
Why don't you get in there, then?

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:20.839
You little assmonkey.

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:26.720
- What's his problem?
- I guess it's you two, then. Who's first?

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:31.808
Oh, man.
No one wants to go in. They're scared.

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:34.269
- Here! Over here!
- He's got it.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:35.729
- He's got it!
- What? Oh.

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.022
- Right here.
- Where?

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.231
- Over here.
- Bring it in.

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:40.317
- Come on! Look.
- Hey, come here.

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:43.236
- Just one?
- Hey, here.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.446
Careful, don't drop it.

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.197
Be careful not to break it!

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.616
- Here we go.
- Come on.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:48.909
Yeah!

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.286
Wow, this is it right here!

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:52.954
It was tough getting it out.

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:54.414
It was really lodged there in the mud.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:56.416
- Let's take off these barnacles.
- Hey, hey!

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.501
- You'll ruin it. Give it to me.
- Oh? No?

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.378
- It needs to be desalinated.
- Easy.

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:02.297
Hey, did you see
a lot down there?

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.091
Don't even ask. Ugh!
I could barely see with this current.

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:06.301
When the current stopped,

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.219
I was able to get it out,
but I had to haul ass.

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:10.096
This is the only one you found?

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.683
Well, thing is I felt a few more
while I was down there, so we're good.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:16.019
Why did you bring just one with you
when you could've grabbed them all?

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.605
We don't have time for this shit!
Get back in there!

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.065
Wait... I should go again?

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:22.859
I can't.
Not with the current this strong.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.945
- And it's only getting stronger.
- Get a rope right now! Come on, move it!

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:27.280
- But...
- Tie it around yourself.

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:28.615
- Don't worry, all right?
- What?

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:31.034
Get down there and get more.
One piece won't cut it.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.828
No fucking way.
I can't do this alone! Ah, shit!

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:35.747
Wait! Why are you giving me that
when I said I can't do it?

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.831
Just quit your yapping

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:39.167
and get your ass down there already
like I'm telling you to!

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.794
- No, I...
- By now you could've pulled up

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:43.797
at least another piece!
Ah, shit.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.466
Tell me how we're supposed to get
a thousand at this rate!

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:49.135
We can't even cover
the cost of labor with this shit.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:53.014
Did we drag our asses all the way out here
just to get one fucking ceramic out?

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:54.391
Fuck.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.643
What are you waiting for? Get going!

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.814
Come on, man. You trying to kill a guy?

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.691
I will kill you
if you don't get down there!

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:04.150
Ugh, shit.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:07.570
I said, I can't do this alone!

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.115
Ugh, fuck this, man.

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:13.201
My uncle was right.

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:15.328
At this rate,
we probably wouldn't break even.

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.347
Is he gonna
stay down there all night?

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:37.225
The sun's almost down,
what's taking him so long?

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:39.144
Here.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.312
No, thank you.
Those things are bad for you.

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.189
Are you going to
keep backing out?

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:47.569
You gotta go in there first, man.
There's a thing called seniority.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:50.405
What's that got to do with it, though?
We should stick to the order.

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:52.490
You shit, why am I going next?

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:55.285
What? How the hell should I know?
You should ask him, he's the boss.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:59.873
Look, I'm asking you to go in first, man.
I'm scared of the water.

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.585
I don't even eat seafood, you know?

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.796
You fucking asshole!
I'm not asking you to catch fish.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.298
He's up!

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.008
- He's back?
- Where?

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:11.718
Dang, he got drifted
all the way over there.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.887
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What is it?

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.555
The current's strong, isn't it?

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:16.639
How'd it go?

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:20.060
It's like I said,
I'm blind as a bat down there.

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.353
- Ugh, shit.
- That means it's a bust, you guys.

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:24.981
- I think we should head back.
- Damn.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:29.486
Ah, damn it. All that
for just one lousy little...

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.071
Let's call it!

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.999
- Sorry to bother you.
- Evening, sir.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:46.878
There wouldn't happen to be
an Oh Gwanseok staying here, would there?

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:50.298
Oh, dear. The bunch of them left
for Jeungdo already.

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:52.133
- Jeungdo?
- Yeah.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:56.971
Oh.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:01.559
- All right, careful getting off, guys.
- Here we go!

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:05.105
Here, be careful with it!

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:06.314
Take my hand.

00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:10.985
- It hurts. My back.
- It's a high step.

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:15.698
Ugh, fuck, why the hell is this so hard?
This is gonna take forever.

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:17.826
I'm sick of hearing
y'all complaining.

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:20.954
Tiger, gimme a cigarette, would you?

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.915
Captain Hwang.

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:25.875
You got him.

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:31.256
Can you find more divers?

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:33.508
I'll see if I can.

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:36.094
Rice planting season's over,
so there's guys who need work.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:39.055
We need those ladies who dive for seafood.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:42.642
Men or women, that don't matter.
We just need as many as we can get.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.687
- It's killing me.
- He's really not looking good.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:52.861
Why's he like that?

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:54.696
He got the bends.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:55.905
What's the bends?

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:57.949
When you dive too deep...

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:01.578
I don't know, man.
Just something that happens.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:10.044
Good, good, good.
Go easy when you pour, okay?

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:13.464
Gently. Easy, now. And get more water.

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:15.425
- How much more?
- Here.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.969
You want it to be deep enough
to fully cover it.

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:20.388
So this is okay? Isn't this freshwater?

00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:21.848
Has to be freshwater.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:24.434
That's how you get the salt out.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.811
It can take a while, even up to a year.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:30.023
- Up to a year?
- Otherwise, it'll crumble to pieces.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:34.402
It's as delicate as a newborn right now,
so we have to work carefully.

00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:38.281
We'll have to get all the barnacles off.
But I gotta say, it looks great.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:42.452
Fuck, imagine if there were a ton of these
just waiting for us down there?

00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:48.333
Hey, try having some of this.
Here. It's miyeokguk.

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:56.174
Don't eat the solid bits.

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:57.675
Just try and drink the broth.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:00.511
This'll get him better?

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:01.679
Beats me.

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:04.641
We don't got any medicine here,
but he needs to eat something.

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.685
Oh, man.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.356
Spit it out if it's too much. Yeah?

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.274
It's just... It's just...

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:16.194
Beolgu.
What went on down there?

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:19.364
I kept trying to breathe.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.660
- There was no air.
- You couldn't get any air?

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:27.163
The hell? I was pumping
so damn hard. Shit.

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:31.751
I was trying, but...
...but I couldn't breathe...

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:36.714
Then I don't know...

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.467
Could the hose have any holes or leaks?

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.177
That'd be bad.

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:43.638
If the hose has holes in it,
the divers are as good as dead down there.

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:46.266
Ugh, shit.

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:49.060
We have to make sure. Go get the hose.

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.437
- C'mon, let's go.
- Just bring the whole thing over here.

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.189
- Okay.
- Yup.

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:02.448
Nice and slow, all right?
Nice and slow.

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.742
Easy, now. Easy.
Keep pumping that thing, okay?

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:06.995
- What?
- Let's see.

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.792
Oh! Oh, there it is. I found it!
Here. Oh, man.

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:14.085
Hey, mark it there.

00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:15.420
Tie this around it.

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.630
Man, why'd you bring
a leaky-ass hose?

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:20.883
Don't stop pumping.
We gotta find all the leaks.

00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:23.469
My arms are gonna fall off.

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:25.805
- Look, there's another one!
- Oh, come on.

00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:28.391
Son of a bitch.
This coulda killed any one of us.

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:31.060
You fucking idiot, what're you doing
bringing this shit?

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.021
I just grabbed what they used before.
How would I know?

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:35.857
Hey! Stop that. That's enough.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.941
Just drop it.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.445
We'll go to Mokpo and get a new one.

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:41.946
That's enough.

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:47.577
Well, anyway, we could've died
if it wasn't for you.

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:51.664
I've seen this before,
I used to work on a boat.

00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:53.499
You can't fix this thing.

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.626
Really? What tonnage?

00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:59.338
Deep-sea fishing vessels.
Mostly on the Indian Ocean.

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:02.216
Sounds tough, but you did always
have the look of a sailor.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.719
Hey, Seokbae. You got any booze here?

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:05.887
I got cheongju here.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.598
Yeah, go get it, then.
Let's get fucking hammered.

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:10.224
Maybe you should go easy.

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:13.019
How are we supposed to work
without it? Ain't that right?

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:15.063
Men of the sea bond over drinks.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.358
You're damn right.

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:21.778
What about food? You got anything to eat?

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.571
You saw outside. Cock-a-doodle-doo.

00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:25.323
Hey, hey! No, we're not doing that.

00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:26.741
Why the hell not?

00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:29.952
Why're you even raising them
if you're not gonna eat 'em?

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.246
Well I-I just...
Those are just, uh...

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.124
Hey! Wait! I said don't. No, wait. C'mon!

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.293
- It's quick.
- No, they're not for eating. Hey!

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:38.586
- Don't you dare!
- Let's do it.

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:43.382
Those are Siamese hens out there!
For eggs! Hey! Get your hands off! Hey!

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:44.634
- I said don't eat them!
- It's okay.

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:46.803
I'm sad about this too. I'm here with you.

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:53.476
I just think it would
really help if you put in a good word.

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:57.396
I bet if you did then finding a job
for Beolgu would be a piece of cake!

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.982
Honggi, you'll do this for your auntie.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:03.194
Remember when you fell down the stairs
at my house in third grade

00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:05.071
and cracked your head open?

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:07.698
I saw it from the kitchen,
so I ran over to where you were lying

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:09.450
with a handful of doenjang.

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:12.411
Blood was everywhere, so I rubbed
that stuff right on your head!

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.580
He was bleeding like crazy that day,

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:16.791
and his neck was all crooked too,

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:19.627
and his eyes they were all rolled back.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.170
Oh, my.

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:24.841
I was beside myself.
My heart was pounding.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.551
Your auntie stayed calm, though.

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:29.095
She came right over
and smacked that paste on.

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:32.849
I got nerves of steel, that's right.

00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:35.685
All right, enough.

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:39.147
Thing is, I'm a civil servant.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.108
If something goes wrong
while I'm pulling strings,

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:43.734
I won't be the only one going down.

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:46.362
Oh, you think I would...
I won't say a word!

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.615
Who would I even tell that to?
I wouldn't do that.

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.826
That aside though,

00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:53.703
let's talk about the crates
at Uncle's store.

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:55.121
Yeah?

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:57.707
So, why is it that you keep moving
those crates to the shed next door?

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:01.043
Well that's just, you see,
the neighbor, he said--

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:03.296
You all have had some
big fights though, right?

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:06.883
The shop owner, he's always
complaining to us, you know?

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.135
Says he's gonna burn them
if you leave them there.

00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:12.513
I don't know what his problem is
that he would say all that.

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:16.100
See? You should cut it out
with all the tricks.

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:18.394
Just at least try and play fair.

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:21.731
Always trying to pull something in secret.

00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:24.317
What do you mean by tricks?

00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:29.238
That hurts, Honggi.

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:33.159
How can you say something awful like that
to your dear aunt, huh?

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:38.789
- All right, I heard you. Huh?
- Good.

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:40.750
I'll give a call
to the company then, okay?

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:42.543
But I can't promise anything.

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.548
Honggi! Why would you...

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:50.301
There's no need for all that.

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:52.595
I'm so sorry.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:56.933
That condescending jerk.

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:59.185
Thinks he's some hot shot.

00:16:59.268 --> 00:17:00.645
That little bastard.

00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:17.995
♪ Let's go to the beach ♪

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.956
♪ Where the stars pour down ♪

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.250
♪ Let's go to the beach ♪

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:26.045
Hmm, we need
some more firewood for kindling.

00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:29.215
Hey, quit goofin' around
and grab some firewood, you guys.

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:31.008
All right, yeah, man.

00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:35.680
We'll need it
for heating too, so bring a lot!

00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:37.181
I said I got it.

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:39.100
We're definitely
gonna need more.

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:41.978
Come on, can't you just do it
without me needing to nag you? Ugh.

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:43.229
Not these kids.

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:47.400
Now this... This is a real feast.

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:49.527
{\an8}I used to make a killing
off some easy marks, man.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:51.362
{\an8}"A JACKPOT ITEM
FOR MINIMAL INVESTMENT"

00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:53.239
{\an8}Once I got five million won for a piece.

00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:55.241
- Five million for one?
- That's right.

00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:58.077
Wait, I didn't know
jackpots like that even existed.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.245
Here, guys, eat up.

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:00.830
{\an8}Chawan, It was a chawan...

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.206
{\an8}"CHAWAN: A TEA BOWL WITH A LID"

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.000
{\an8}...and holy shit, it was one of a kind.

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:07.837
As soon as I laid eyes on it,
I snatched that shit up.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.921
I'm serious.

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:10.756
Who's buying
a chawan for five million?

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.425
You guys should eat this.

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:14.343
- Are we out of drinks?
- Ah, it's hot.

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:15.428
- Hey, Seokbae.
- What is it?

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:16.762
You got any more booze stashed away?

00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:18.306
- Oh, man.
- That's all I got.

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:21.392
Then go knock on some doors
and get us some more.

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:25.313
Ah, man. It's all old people around here.
They're not gonna have any drinks.

00:18:25.396 --> 00:18:27.732
- Why not?
- Come on, lay off the drinks.

00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:30.151
We gotta go back out there
and work tomorrow.

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:33.613
- Hey, we're just getting started.
- Fucking drunks.

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:35.364
- Daesik.
- Hmm?

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.408
You're going in first.

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:40.911
Don't forget,
that's what you said, you swore.

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:45.458
Ugh, geez. I gave you my word, didn't I?

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:49.795
Hey, Jeonchul. Who do you think
you are? You're first tomorrow.

00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:53.257
- Ugh, come on. Relax and have some soju.
- Ah, shit...

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:54.675
Why?

00:18:57.928 --> 00:18:58.929
Heedong,

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.432
what are you doing with your cut?

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:03.684
Buy a house.

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:04.852
What kind of house?

00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:10.149
Something big,
with a nice little lawn and a dog.

00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:14.278
Gwanseok, what about you?

00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:16.530
What will you do with your cut?

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:18.658
That ain't none of your business.

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:20.451
What about you, Captain?

00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:25.414
Gonna buy a big boat
and fish for tuna in the Indian Ocean.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:28.125
Come on, why put yourself
through all that?

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.836
You should just sail around
and take it easy.

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.589
What would you do if you hit it rich?

00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:39.637
What would I do? I'd use
that money to buy my mom a house.

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:43.683
She worked her butt off
on a farm her whole damn life.

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:46.018
Still got nothing to show for it.

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:48.729
I want to take care of her.

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:51.065
Get her a house.

00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:53.442
A nicer farm with some cows, too.

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:55.945
That's the dream, isn't it?

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.905
Daesik, hey, what are you doing, man?

00:19:57.988 --> 00:19:59.615
I gotta piss.

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:03.911
- Hey, go over there. Over there.
- Damn it.

00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:06.205
Seriously, dude?
What the hell are you doing?

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:08.916
- You're crazy.
- Whatever, I gotta take a leak.

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:11.836
- Hey, go do it over there, dumbass!
- Ah, c'mon, man. Use the damn bathroom.

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:13.546
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:16.340
Ah, shit!

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:18.926
- Are you serious?
- Come on, man!

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:20.803
- Come on!
- Put that thing away!

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:24.014
Look at you fucking small timers
trying to get a quick buck.

00:20:24.098 --> 00:20:25.558
None of you are shit.

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:33.274
Ugh, that son of a bitch is
a fucking animal when he's drunk.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.903
Were you always afraid of the sea?

00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:41.866
I told you, I almost drowned a while back.

00:20:42.783 --> 00:20:45.077
I'm only here 'cause of Chairman Cheon.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:46.871
I would've left already if I could.

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:52.418
The truth is being out there is rough.

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:55.755
On a boat anyone can
turn on you, just like that.

00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:57.798
I keep my eyes wide open.

00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:01.218
Do you have to stay, though?

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:02.428
You should just go.

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:05.347
Are you serious?
Have you been listening to me at all?

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.058
Could talk to the chairman's wife.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.688
Fuck me.

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:20.654
Hey.

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.116
Nah, forget it.

00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:29.330
- Hey.
- What's up?

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:35.586
Y'know, the chairman's wife
and I actually used to be married.

00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:37.880
What?

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:41.509
When the ship sank,
she thought I sank with it.

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:43.719
Figured I was dead.

00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:46.222
Eventually she remarried.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:48.098
Can't even be mad at her.

00:21:48.182 --> 00:21:49.433
I was gone for like...

00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:52.353
12 fucking years. Shit.

00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:57.191
So why're you working for Chairman Cheon?

00:21:58.192 --> 00:22:00.861
She says the old man is gonna die soon.

00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:04.114
And after he croaks, it'll all be ours.

00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:05.282
So what can I do?

00:22:09.078 --> 00:22:10.287
Then outta nowhere...

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:14.542
Cheon sends me down here
to work with you guys.

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:18.212
I've got pretty good instincts
for this shit.

00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:21.882
Something shady's going on here.

00:22:24.927 --> 00:22:25.928
Heedong,

00:22:26.804 --> 00:22:29.348
I don't wanna die out here.
Help me make it out.

00:22:30.391 --> 00:22:33.978
If you do, I'll get you that house
you wanted with the backyard.

00:22:35.145 --> 00:22:36.355
I give you my word.

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:43.571
Come on, let's get another drink.

00:22:59.628 --> 00:23:01.255
Okay, sir. You're good to go.

00:23:01.338 --> 00:23:02.923
Thank you.

00:23:17.813 --> 00:23:19.023
Hello.

00:23:19.106 --> 00:23:21.650
Good evening, ma'am.
What can I do for ya?

00:23:21.734 --> 00:23:27.364
Well, my friend, she works here.
And we are her guests, okay?

00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:29.158
Who invited you?

00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:31.619
Hmm? Our friend.

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:34.038
I think he's asking for her name, though.

00:23:34.538 --> 00:23:36.248
Oh. Seonyeong.

00:23:37.458 --> 00:23:38.792
Seonyeong.

00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:41.629
I said that she works here.

00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:43.255
She's the auctioneer!

00:23:44.048 --> 00:23:45.966
- Can I get your ID?
- Hmm?

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.510
- Just give it to him already.
- Ah.

00:23:48.594 --> 00:23:50.971
Who does he think he is,
asking for ID.

00:23:51.055 --> 00:23:52.473
Yours too, Jungsook.

00:23:52.556 --> 00:23:53.599
Mine too?

00:23:53.682 --> 00:23:56.393
- Me?
- Yes, both of you.

00:23:56.477 --> 00:23:57.603
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:05.194
How do you know
about this place anyway?

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:09.073
One of my regulars works here.
Her husband's an American soldier.

00:24:09.156 --> 00:24:10.491
I see.

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:15.120
Oh.

00:24:18.082 --> 00:24:19.541
Seonyeong.

00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:22.211
Sorry. So glad you could make it tonight.

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:25.297
Seonyeong, you look beautiful!

00:24:25.381 --> 00:24:27.341
I got this dress
at your store the other day.

00:24:27.424 --> 00:24:29.927
I know. It was made for you.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.638
You look fantastic.

00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:35.307
Oh, this here is
the Heungbaek chairman's wife.

00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:37.685
It's so great to meet you.

00:24:37.768 --> 00:24:41.438
You too. So this venue,
what is it exactly?

00:24:41.522 --> 00:24:43.148
A US Army assembly hall.

00:24:43.232 --> 00:24:45.776
And sometimes
they'll hold these auctions here.

00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:48.278
Many Americans
are interested in pottery as well.

00:24:48.362 --> 00:24:50.197
- I see.
- Wow, I didn't know!

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.532
Here.

00:24:51.615 --> 00:24:53.242
Seonyeong, here you go.

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:56.495
The Sinan one?

00:24:56.578 --> 00:24:58.288
It was in the sea. Not easy to find.

00:24:58.372 --> 00:25:01.000
- This way, please.
- All right.

00:25:10.134 --> 00:25:12.219
I'll start the appraisal process.
You can go on ahead.

00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:13.303
- Okay.
- Thanks, Seonyeong.

00:25:13.387 --> 00:25:15.222
- Sure, I'll see you in there.
- Sounds good.

00:25:17.975 --> 00:25:18.976
Hi, come on in.

00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:21.979
This is from Sinan.
Please take a close look at it.

00:25:22.062 --> 00:25:23.564
- I'll have a look in a moment.
- Okay.

00:25:23.647 --> 00:25:25.774
- Shall we head in?
- Uh-huh.

00:25:30.904 --> 00:25:32.197
Wow.

00:25:32.281 --> 00:25:33.282
Oh, my...

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:35.242
Jungsook. Look at that.

00:25:35.325 --> 00:25:37.995
Ooh.

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:39.455
This is a big deal, isn't it?

00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:43.042
- Yeah, I know.
- Ms. Yang, is that you?

00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:44.460
Well, if it isn't Mr. Kim.

00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:46.628
I didn't expect to see you.

00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:48.505
You can say that again.

00:25:48.589 --> 00:25:50.507
I had no idea you were
interested in this sort of thing.

00:25:50.591 --> 00:25:53.093
No. Not at all.

00:25:53.177 --> 00:25:55.971
I just came by to say hi
to the commander here,

00:25:56.055 --> 00:25:57.890
and I figured,
I might as well take a look-see.

00:25:57.973 --> 00:25:59.391
I see.

00:25:59.475 --> 00:26:02.269
This is my close friend.
I should introduce you two.

00:26:02.352 --> 00:26:04.313
- Hello there.
- Yeah, hello.

00:26:05.481 --> 00:26:08.734
Well, all right, then.
Enjoy yourselves, ladies.

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:10.486
Thanks.

00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:11.987
Who was that?

00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:15.115
That was Assemblyman Kim Myeonggu,
my husband's backer.

00:26:15.199 --> 00:26:16.617
Oh.

00:26:17.826 --> 00:26:20.370
- Where do you wanna sit?
- Well, how about over there?

00:26:20.454 --> 00:26:22.164
- Sure.
- Okay, go ahead.

00:26:23.499 --> 00:26:25.334
5,200.

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:28.087
Is anyone going for 5,300?

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.798
Do I have 5,300 dollars?

00:26:30.881 --> 00:26:32.674
Is no one going to bid higher?

00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:34.927
No one?

00:26:37.054 --> 00:26:39.765
Number nine. 5,200.

00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:44.103
That's the highest bid.
Then we're going once. We're going twice.

00:26:44.895 --> 00:26:46.355
Okay, sold.

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:47.815
5,200.

00:26:47.898 --> 00:26:50.609
- Sold for 5,200 dollars.
- Do you know how much that is in won?

00:26:51.401 --> 00:26:53.070
One dollar comes to 480...

00:26:55.656 --> 00:26:57.407
That's 2.5 million?

00:26:58.075 --> 00:26:59.910
Wait, really? That hunk of junk?

00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:01.495
Who would have thought?

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.920
That's the one I'm looking forward to.

00:27:10.003 --> 00:27:12.840
Now, the next item is Chinese pottery.

00:27:12.923 --> 00:27:14.299
Chinese pottery.

00:27:14.383 --> 00:27:17.970
This pottery's from
the 14th century Yuan Dynasty in China.

00:27:18.053 --> 00:27:20.264
It was found off the coast of Sinan.

00:27:20.347 --> 00:27:23.475
As you can see, there's very little wear
and no damage.

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:27.729
It's in great condition.
The color and shape are well preserved.

00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:30.774
This piece is a rare
and excellent representation

00:27:30.858 --> 00:27:32.776
of the pottery of its time.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.488
So then, let's start the bidding
at 3,000 dollars, shall we?

00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:40.367
- Do I have anyone with 3,000?
- 3,000? 1.5 million...

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.661
It seems this item is very popular.

00:27:42.744 --> 00:27:44.705
All right, how about
we raise the bid on it, then?

00:27:44.788 --> 00:27:47.541
3,200? 3,200.

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:50.627
Who's next? 3,500.

00:27:50.711 --> 00:27:52.129
Do I have 3,500?

00:27:52.212 --> 00:27:54.047
3,500.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.968
Wow. All right, then.
Anyone bidding 4,000?

00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:00.637
4,000. 4,000 dollars.

00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:01.930
Anyone? For 4,000?

00:28:02.014 --> 00:28:05.017
Okay, let's go to 4,200.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.810
Do I have 4,200?

00:28:06.894 --> 00:28:11.064
4,200 do... Okay, we have 4,200 dollars.

00:28:11.148 --> 00:28:13.734
Is anyone going for 4,500?

00:28:13.817 --> 00:28:17.070
Do I have 4,500 dollars? 4,500.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.658
RAINY GOMORYEONG

00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:57.194
You're still up.

00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:01.531
Now where have you been all day?

00:29:01.615 --> 00:29:03.992
I had a meeting with the girls.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.496
Why did your meeting
run so late into the night?

00:29:08.705 --> 00:29:11.416
We lose track of time
catching up with each other, silly.

00:29:12.292 --> 00:29:14.586
But what are you doing
out of bed so late like this?

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.714
- Thought you weren't feeling good.
- How's the pottery search going? Any luck?

00:29:17.798 --> 00:29:19.216
They found one in fact.

00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:22.177
It's in great condition
for having been underwater.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.222
Well, where is it?
Why didn't you bring it with you?

00:29:25.305 --> 00:29:28.350
They said something about how
they have to desalinate it?

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:31.603
All that aside, it looks like
it'll bring in a lot of money.

00:29:35.023 --> 00:29:38.652
I guess that depends
on if the Americans like it.

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:42.531
I'm sure
they're going to love it.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.324
I'm pretty sure.

00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:50.789
Hey, guys! Get up.
Hurry! It's late already, let's go.

00:29:52.874 --> 00:29:56.086
- Oh, shit.
- My head's killing me. This fucking sucks.

00:29:56.169 --> 00:29:58.505
Hey, hey, rise and shine.

00:29:58.588 --> 00:30:00.382
Told you to go easy on the booze.

00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:02.843
Daesik, get up.

00:30:02.926 --> 00:30:05.679
My foot. It hurts.

00:30:05.762 --> 00:30:06.763
Let's see it.

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:11.977
Do you have gout?

00:30:12.686 --> 00:30:15.772
Yeesh, he can't even walk,
let alone dive.

00:30:15.856 --> 00:30:19.109
Shit,
we're already short handed as it is.

00:30:19.192 --> 00:30:22.446
Daesik. You okay?

00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:24.072
You're supposed to dive today.

00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:26.241
Fuck. Don't touch me.

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:27.826
Jeonchul.

00:30:29.119 --> 00:30:31.747
Looks like you're diving in first today.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.874
You know we're all taking turns
going in the water,

00:30:33.957 --> 00:30:36.918
so don't try to weasel out of it.
Got it?

00:30:38.211 --> 00:30:39.337
Ow, what the...

00:30:39.421 --> 00:30:41.048
Get ready.

00:30:41.131 --> 00:30:43.925
Hwang and I are gonna go to Mokpo
and get a new hose.

00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:46.178
Take good care of Daesik.

00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:49.598
Geez. Fucking idiot.

00:30:50.182 --> 00:30:51.808
I can't do it, okay?

00:30:52.893 --> 00:30:56.146
When I even think about diving,
I feel like I'm suffocating.

00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:59.357
Hey, you worked
on a ship before.

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.027
At least you've got some experience.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:05.155
Do you really have to throw in
some hopeless rookie first?

00:31:05.238 --> 00:31:07.115
That's so fucking pathetic.

00:31:08.617 --> 00:31:10.619
- Hurry up.
- Yeah.

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:32.182
The big bad sailor's
wettin' his pants in there.

00:31:32.265 --> 00:31:35.310
Damn, that wind.
I don't know if we can make it to Mokpo.

00:31:36.353 --> 00:31:38.105
What do you mean? They won't sail out?

00:31:38.188 --> 00:31:40.690
Nah, not like this.
The boat'll capsize.

00:31:40.774 --> 00:31:43.860
Every day we waste
is money down the drain.

00:31:44.361 --> 00:31:46.196
We can still check it out.

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:52.744
Thanks.

00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:55.747
Hey, Gwanseok!

00:31:57.207 --> 00:32:00.335
- Man, I'm glad I caught up with ya.
- What are you doing here?

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:04.047
What am I doing here?
Listen, I need to talk to you.

00:32:04.131 --> 00:32:05.340
I'm heading out. Can it wait?

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:08.760
I just need a minute with you.
It's not like you're leaving this second.

00:32:08.844 --> 00:32:11.263
Hey. I'll hold the boat,
you guys talk it out.

00:32:11.346 --> 00:32:13.348
- All right, I'll see you there.
- Okay.

00:32:13.849 --> 00:32:15.142
What is it?

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.148
Listen.

00:32:21.648 --> 00:32:24.693
Are you with me or are you with Mrs. Yang?
Just give it to me straight.

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:26.903
Where the hell is all of this coming from?

00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:29.614
You know what that woman said?

00:32:29.698 --> 00:32:31.116
After her little trip down here,

00:32:31.199 --> 00:32:33.410
she said that everything from Sinan
is hers now.

00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:36.621
Gwanseok, talk to me.
I'm about to lose my mind here.

00:32:36.705 --> 00:32:37.831
Where do you stand on this?

00:32:37.914 --> 00:32:39.583
Oh, for fuck's sake.

00:32:41.543 --> 00:32:44.254
Hey. Did that woman win you over?

00:32:44.838 --> 00:32:47.632
Tell me somethin'. You rich?

00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:49.009
What are you asking?

00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:52.304
Do you have enough money to cut her
out of this? That's what I'm asking.

00:32:52.387 --> 00:32:55.599
Look here, okay? Putting money
over people is just bad business!

00:32:55.682 --> 00:32:57.350
And to cut me out? It's not right!

00:32:57.434 --> 00:33:00.061
See, with her,
all of this is gonna be simple.

00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:03.148
She's just gonna buy everything.
Anything at all, no exceptions.

00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:05.025
That's exactly what I promised you.

00:33:05.108 --> 00:33:08.486
I mean, things got really messy there
for a second. All these guys got involved.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.031
And then she just came in
and cleaned everything up.

00:33:11.114 --> 00:33:13.992
That's real nice. While she cuts me
out of the whole deal?

00:33:14.075 --> 00:33:16.620
You're missing the point entirely.

00:33:17.245 --> 00:33:20.707
You can still get paid
if you stop and listen for a second.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:23.168
Then enlighten me on just how exactly.

00:33:23.251 --> 00:33:25.212
You know the fake ones you got?

00:33:25.295 --> 00:33:28.215
You can give them to us
and we can sell them to her.

00:33:29.049 --> 00:33:32.260
That way you can get rid
of all of the replicas, right?

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:37.182
So bring 'em all over!
I'll mix 'em up so she can't tell!

00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:40.143
And then I'll get a great price for ya.

00:33:40.227 --> 00:33:41.436
Are we good now?

00:33:43.313 --> 00:33:45.148
Wait. Are you gonna keep your word?

00:33:45.232 --> 00:33:48.401
Look at me. Look me in the eyes.
Am I lying?

00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:51.112
You mean it, right?

00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:53.073
I'm on your side, Song.

00:33:53.156 --> 00:33:54.157
All right, then.

00:33:54.241 --> 00:33:57.244
- I can't believe you don't trust me.
- I got it, okay, okay.

00:33:57.327 --> 00:33:59.913
Gwanseok, thank you.
I really appreciate this.

00:34:00.622 --> 00:34:02.624
Oh, right. Before I forget.

00:34:13.176 --> 00:34:14.636
What's this now?

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:17.555
It's five million.
It's from Chairman Cheon.

00:34:19.307 --> 00:34:21.351
It's for Jeonchul, not the pottery deal.

00:34:24.437 --> 00:34:27.065
If you can't do it,
I'll return the cash to Cheon.

00:34:27.774 --> 00:34:29.317
Let me know what you wanna do.

00:34:31.611 --> 00:34:32.654
Come on, take it.

00:34:39.494 --> 00:34:42.038
His foot is a damn mess,
that's for sure.

00:34:43.164 --> 00:34:44.958
Who knew he had gout?

00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:49.671
That's why I told him
to lay off the drinking.

00:34:52.132 --> 00:34:55.093
This is no good.
Mokpo's got a doctor or a clinic, right?

00:34:55.176 --> 00:34:57.470
- Yeah.
- Listen.

00:35:00.682 --> 00:35:03.810
He's not doing too hot either.
Let's take him too.

00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:05.437
Did he get hurt?

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:12.861
How did he get like that?

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.989
He went into the water with a busted hose.

00:35:23.705 --> 00:35:25.957
Can I talk to you outside
for a minute?

00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:40.472
Come here.

00:35:42.891 --> 00:35:44.100
What are you thinking of doing?

00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:46.478
What?

00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:49.397
His face is all gray.
He might not make it.

00:35:50.774 --> 00:35:53.526
And if he dies out here,
then things will get worse.

00:35:54.444 --> 00:35:57.447
And Mokpo's
out of the question now.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:59.908
There's no way to help him, is there?

00:36:07.248 --> 00:36:09.751
You could just dump him out in the sea.

00:36:11.586 --> 00:36:12.712
In the sea?

00:36:13.505 --> 00:36:15.590
People die,
that's just how life goes.

00:36:15.674 --> 00:36:19.552
But if he dies here and they find out
about it, we'll all take the fall for it.

00:36:21.262 --> 00:36:22.347
Just think about it.

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:26.351
Hey. How did you end up
with this many people?

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:28.311
Don't even ask.

00:36:28.395 --> 00:36:31.690
Things got all messed up and shit.
Now everything's goin' wrong.

00:36:31.773 --> 00:36:32.982
Ah, geez.

00:36:33.733 --> 00:36:35.193
Good grief.

00:36:38.363 --> 00:36:40.448
You better be measurin' it right.

00:36:40.532 --> 00:36:43.118
Don't screw around,
'cause I'm gonna be checkin' your work.

00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:45.787
Right,
and you'll pay me pennies too.

00:36:59.676 --> 00:37:01.052
What's the matter?

00:37:09.269 --> 00:37:10.562
Listen...

00:37:11.479 --> 00:37:15.442
When you're out fishing...
sometimes there's accidents, right?

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:17.068
Yeah, things happen.

00:37:19.612 --> 00:37:21.364
How do you normally handle it?

00:37:21.448 --> 00:37:23.783
What, do you...
call the police and report it?

00:37:23.867 --> 00:37:25.368
Of course, you gotta.

00:37:27.203 --> 00:37:29.330
We can cover it up if it's iffy, though.

00:37:31.541 --> 00:37:34.794
What, cover it up? You can do that?

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:40.258
Uh, guess that depends on the situation.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:43.845
So what is the situation?

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:48.391
Well, let's say one of us
gets in some kind of accident out there.

00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:51.102
Think you could cover that up?

00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:53.354
I get it. Somethin's up again.

00:37:56.399 --> 00:37:58.318
You gotta give me details
if you want my help.

00:37:58.401 --> 00:38:00.528
Okay? Okay.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:09.913
Just between us.

00:38:09.996 --> 00:38:11.164
No shit.

00:38:12.707 --> 00:38:14.667
If you're worried
I'm gonna talk, just forget it.

00:38:14.751 --> 00:38:18.296
The truth is,
there's another reason I'm here.

00:38:18.797 --> 00:38:19.881
A job I gotta do.

00:38:21.674 --> 00:38:23.301
There's a mark I gotta take out.

00:38:23.384 --> 00:38:24.636
Who is it?

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:26.721
Jeonchul.

00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:30.391
Hmm.

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:33.353
They told you to kill Jeonchul?

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:35.605
Yeah.

00:38:39.651 --> 00:38:42.362
Ain't that some shit...
That don't feel right.

00:38:44.823 --> 00:38:47.450
I mean, the two of us
drank soju together and everything.

00:38:48.034 --> 00:38:50.537
Listen, I didn't come here
to make friends, you know that.

00:38:51.246 --> 00:38:52.622
We gotta do what we're paid to do.

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:56.709
It ain't so simple,
takin' someone out like that though.

00:38:57.627 --> 00:38:58.628
I know.

00:39:01.714 --> 00:39:02.841
If you're gonna do it...

00:39:05.218 --> 00:39:08.888
I would think the best shot
would be while he's diving.

00:39:08.972 --> 00:39:09.973
Okay. How?

00:39:10.557 --> 00:39:12.642
Well, the hose
could get tangled or somethin'.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.154
How much do I get?

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:31.035
If it's done clean, then...

00:39:33.872 --> 00:39:35.081
A million, straight.

00:39:43.673 --> 00:39:45.884
And you better pay it straight.

00:39:46.467 --> 00:39:48.136
This is about someone's life.

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.220
Of course.

00:39:50.889 --> 00:39:53.224
If you go runnin' your mouth,
I'll feed you to the fish.

00:39:54.183 --> 00:39:55.184
Got it.

00:39:56.269 --> 00:39:57.312
Hmm.

00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:00.648
Mmm.

00:40:01.691 --> 00:40:03.067
Mmm.

00:40:18.583 --> 00:40:21.210
The waves have calmed down.
We can head out.

00:40:21.294 --> 00:40:22.295
Mmm.

00:40:23.296 --> 00:40:26.716
All right, we need to set
the diving order.

00:40:26.799 --> 00:40:28.092
Gather around.

00:40:28.176 --> 00:40:31.220
Ugh, come on.
What we gotta go do that for?

00:40:31.304 --> 00:40:33.181
We're all getting in the water anyway.

00:40:33.765 --> 00:40:35.141
I want y'all to listen up.

00:40:35.224 --> 00:40:37.936
The one with the hose
will be sweeping the floor,

00:40:38.019 --> 00:40:40.980
and the one with the tank
will dig up what the first guy found

00:40:41.064 --> 00:40:45.026
and bring it up to the middle, to where
a second guy with an air tank is waiting.

00:40:45.693 --> 00:40:48.446
And that guy will shuttle the pottery
back to the boat. Got it?

00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:51.157
Going back and forth
like that is too exhausting.

00:40:52.325 --> 00:40:54.369
I'll stay at the top 'cause my back hurts.

00:40:54.452 --> 00:40:57.622
Wait a second. You know my knees
are fucked. I can't kick very well.

00:40:57.705 --> 00:40:59.248
I should be up top.

00:40:59.332 --> 00:41:01.334
Damn, what a load of bullshit.

00:41:01.417 --> 00:41:03.962
Listen up, assholes.
This is how the old saying goes.

00:41:04.045 --> 00:41:06.881
There's an order and hierarchy
you follow when it comes to age.

00:41:06.965 --> 00:41:09.759
Who the hell you think you are
trying to call all the shots round here?

00:41:09.842 --> 00:41:10.885
I should be at the top.

00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:13.763
Quit yapping and listen.
Just do what I tell you to do.

00:41:13.846 --> 00:41:14.847
Seokbae!

00:41:15.598 --> 00:41:17.100
- Hey.
- Are you ready to go?

00:41:17.183 --> 00:41:18.643
Yeah, we're ready.

00:41:18.726 --> 00:41:21.229
- You got the hose?
- It's on the boat.

00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:24.774
All right, everyone, let's go!
We're heading out!

00:41:25.984 --> 00:41:28.778
- Jeonchul, get ready.
- Come on. Let's grab the gear.

00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:30.697
Everyone, let's get going.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.365
Hello, how you doing? Good?

00:41:40.081 --> 00:41:41.791
We're here!

00:41:41.874 --> 00:41:42.875
- All right!
- Okay!

00:41:42.959 --> 00:41:44.877
All right, all right!
Everyone, get ready to go!

00:41:44.961 --> 00:41:45.962
"YONGJIN"

00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:48.339
Let's do this quick.
Guys, get your tanks on.

00:41:48.423 --> 00:41:50.383
- Yeah, hurry, hurry.
- Get ready to dive.

00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:53.094
The current's sure looking great today!

00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:55.471
You're right!
The water's nice and calm, huh?

00:41:56.305 --> 00:41:58.016
But you still gotta be careful!

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:01.185
Jeonchul.

00:42:01.936 --> 00:42:02.937
Get ready to dive.

00:42:03.855 --> 00:42:05.481
I'll do it.

00:42:05.565 --> 00:42:07.984
- No, Jeonchul's going first.
- I said I wanna go.

00:42:08.067 --> 00:42:10.069
- For fuck's sake.
- Hey, forget it.

00:42:10.153 --> 00:42:11.612
You think anyone can dive?

00:42:11.696 --> 00:42:13.865
It just looks easy 'cause we're doing it.

00:42:16.159 --> 00:42:19.829
You should just pay me a little extra.
I'll get 'er done.

00:42:20.413 --> 00:42:22.415
- I appreciate this.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:42:22.498 --> 00:42:25.209
Then you two get on the damn pump.

00:42:27.003 --> 00:42:28.504
Let's move it over there.

00:42:28.588 --> 00:42:30.298
One, two, three, lift.

00:42:32.133 --> 00:42:33.760
Hey. Hey, over here.

00:42:34.427 --> 00:42:36.387
- Bring that over here. Grab that end.
- Go help them.

00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:39.307
Be careful not to get
the air hose tangled, okay?

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:41.726
Don't let it get tangled.

00:42:45.521 --> 00:42:46.522
Beolgu...

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.275
He's gonna die, isn't he?

00:42:49.358 --> 00:42:51.986
Yeah, well, there's bubbles
in his lungs, so he's basically a goner.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.071
So...

00:42:54.197 --> 00:42:55.198
think you can handle it?

00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:00.828
Hold on.

00:43:01.496 --> 00:43:02.789
That's a whole 'nother issue.

00:43:03.498 --> 00:43:06.793
We're in deep shit if he dies on us.
We gotta take care of this now.

00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:12.090
Damn, you're right.

00:43:12.173 --> 00:43:13.508
So how, then?

00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:14.884
I guess...

00:43:15.968 --> 00:43:19.680
I know a spot we can dump his body at,
where no one will find him for a while.

00:43:26.354 --> 00:43:27.980
No one will report it, right?

00:43:30.399 --> 00:43:32.527
He's a lost cause even to his family.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.445
They'll throw a party when he's gone.

00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:37.365
The whole neighborhood will show up. Shit.

00:43:44.705 --> 00:43:46.958
Daesik. Wake up now.

00:43:50.211 --> 00:43:51.420
Rise and shine.

00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:55.007
If you sleep all day,
it'll mess up your schedule.

00:43:55.091 --> 00:43:58.094
My foot hurts so bad. What did...

00:44:02.557 --> 00:44:04.392
All right, rest.

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:07.103
Getting some good sleep
should help with the gout.

00:44:07.603 --> 00:44:09.772
Keep your eyes closed. Just rest.

00:44:09.856 --> 00:44:13.151
My foot... My foot feels...

00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:16.195
I know. It must hurt so much.

00:44:16.779 --> 00:44:17.947
You poor thing.

00:44:18.823 --> 00:44:21.284
Get some rest, sleep it off.

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:26.164
I hope we find
more of 'em today.

00:44:27.206 --> 00:44:28.332
Oh, geez.

00:44:28.416 --> 00:44:30.459
Give it a good sweep, all right?

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.589
Let's get up there, then! Here we go!

00:44:35.173 --> 00:44:36.174
Ready?

00:44:37.008 --> 00:44:41.304
- All right.
- One, two, three! Go!

00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:39.278
Huh?

00:46:07.306 --> 00:46:09.475
Oh, oh! We've got a bite!

00:46:09.558 --> 00:46:11.102
- Pull it up!
- Yeah!

00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:14.146
- Keep going.
- Slow down! You need to slow down!

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:16.941
- Yeah!
- Easy, there! Easy!

00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:20.403
It's coming up,
it's coming up!

00:46:20.486 --> 00:46:22.947
- All right, I got it.
- We got it! Hell yeah!

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.742
- Easy there. Easy.
- Hey! Drop the cigarette and help out!

00:46:26.826 --> 00:46:28.911
I've been working my ass off,
so I deserve a break.

00:46:28.995 --> 00:46:31.539
To hit the jackpot,
we all gotta hustle here!

00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:33.541
Come on, put your backs into it!

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:35.918
- Attagirl!
- Be careful not to break it!

00:46:36.002 --> 00:46:37.003
Careful! Careful!

00:46:37.086 --> 00:46:39.797
Hot damn, look at that!
What a beauty. We hit it big.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.716
Careful!

00:46:41.799 --> 00:46:44.260
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- Wow!

00:46:44.343 --> 00:46:46.512
Would you look at that?
That's the jackpot!

00:46:46.595 --> 00:46:49.765
- Put it over there.
- Guys, keep pumping, all right?

00:46:52.143 --> 00:46:55.146
EMERGENCY ROOM
YULSEONG HOSPITAL

00:46:58.816 --> 00:46:59.817
INJECTION ROOM

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.236
- We're all done here.
- How is he?

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.364
His blood pressure has been
all over the place since last week.

00:47:05.448 --> 00:47:06.991
Is he still taking his medication?

00:47:07.074 --> 00:47:08.951
Yes, of course. He doesn't miss a day.

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:14.957
His blood pressure is
dangerously high. Over 200.

00:47:15.041 --> 00:47:19.003
It might be because
he's got so much on his plate.

00:47:19.086 --> 00:47:20.921
His heart doesn't sound
too good either.

00:47:21.005 --> 00:47:23.007
You know he has a heart condition.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:25.468
Do you know of
any good hospitals overseas?

00:47:25.551 --> 00:47:28.095
He could go into cardiac arrest
if he travels abroad.

00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:29.722
Flying is out of the question.

00:47:31.015 --> 00:47:33.476
Overseas? That's ridiculous.

00:47:33.559 --> 00:47:35.311
I'll be careful and watch what I eat.

00:47:36.395 --> 00:47:39.106
Thanks for taking a look, Doctor.

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.525
Not at all, Chairman. You take care.

00:47:41.609 --> 00:47:44.362
You should go on ahead. I have
a few questions I want to ask the doctor.

00:47:44.445 --> 00:47:45.446
Mmm, okay.

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:47.865
- You're headed to the office, right?
- Oh, of course.

00:47:50.409 --> 00:47:52.703
And, sir, please come by
more often.

00:47:52.787 --> 00:47:55.998
All right, have a good day.
Thank you.

00:47:56.499 --> 00:47:57.833
"DR. KIM BYEONGSEOK"

00:47:57.917 --> 00:47:58.918
Hi.

00:48:00.628 --> 00:48:02.463
So then...

00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:04.256
Could we go over it in more detail?

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.176
How bad is it?
Is there any hope for recovery?

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.971
Given his age, recovery will be slow.

00:48:12.098 --> 00:48:14.308
So he'll need to take it easy with work.

00:48:14.392 --> 00:48:15.768
And no more drinking.

00:48:16.477 --> 00:48:19.688
That's unfortunate.
He loves his drink, that man.

00:48:19.772 --> 00:48:22.274
I absolutely forbid it. It could be fatal.

00:48:22.358 --> 00:48:24.235
You can't let him drink.

00:48:28.072 --> 00:48:30.449
It's been so long.

00:48:30.533 --> 00:48:33.536
I regret that we didn't have dinner
after you came back from your trip.

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.414
Yes, that's why
I'm planning another dinner.

00:48:37.498 --> 00:48:39.917
I was thinking my house,
with the chairman, we could eat together.

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:42.378
Yes.

00:48:43.254 --> 00:48:46.048
The ten executives
that got promoted recently,

00:48:46.132 --> 00:48:47.925
you should invite all of them.

00:48:48.008 --> 00:48:49.009
Yes.

00:48:49.093 --> 00:48:51.262
Ah, what's your favorite liquor?

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:54.181
Of course.

00:48:54.265 --> 00:48:56.434
I mean, you just traveled abroad.

00:48:56.517 --> 00:48:58.477
Right. I'll have plenty of whiskey there.

00:48:59.311 --> 00:49:02.064
It's no trouble, no.

00:49:02.148 --> 00:49:03.607
Don't worry about it all.

00:49:04.316 --> 00:49:06.193
Yes, sure.

00:49:06.277 --> 00:49:08.195
All right,
I'll talk to you soon, Director.

00:49:12.074 --> 00:49:15.870
You're all hardworking big shots.
You deserve to unwind a little.

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:24.712
Oh, I'm spent!
I can't do another one, I'm done.

00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:27.047
And look, it's gonna get dark real soon.

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:28.883
We hauled up a lot.

00:49:28.966 --> 00:49:30.926
Okay, we're done. Let's go!

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:33.762
- Got all the pots there?
- Yeah, let's stop here.

00:49:34.263 --> 00:49:36.474
Let's go! I've had enough of the sea.

00:49:37.475 --> 00:49:38.893
Yeah, I'm ready to get outta here.

00:49:38.976 --> 00:49:40.769
Bokgeun, raise anchor.

00:49:40.853 --> 00:49:42.271
Start the boat!

00:49:43.022 --> 00:49:44.899
- All right. Good work, everyone!
- Let's go!

00:49:44.982 --> 00:49:46.400
You guys did great.

00:49:46.484 --> 00:49:48.319
For the first time
we actually got some real work done.

00:49:48.402 --> 00:49:49.403
Good work, everyone.

00:49:49.487 --> 00:49:52.198
In the end this wasn't a job
we could do with a small crew.

00:49:52.907 --> 00:49:55.868
I didn't get it before. But I do now.

00:49:57.077 --> 00:49:59.288
GOOD LUCK COFFEE SHOP

00:50:07.796 --> 00:50:09.715
Of course, I promise.

00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:12.927
Put a stamp on it.

00:50:16.639 --> 00:50:17.932
How's this?

00:50:28.526 --> 00:50:31.070
Are you lying on the floor
because you got your heart broken?

00:50:31.779 --> 00:50:33.405
- Jongmal.
- Yeah?

00:50:33.489 --> 00:50:36.200
What do you think Ms. Jang's doing
all the way in Gwangju?

00:50:37.243 --> 00:50:39.662
It's a memorial thing
at a relative's house.

00:50:40.454 --> 00:50:42.581
Then she probably won't come back today.

00:50:42.665 --> 00:50:44.959
Probably not.
I don't think she has a ride.

00:50:46.585 --> 00:50:48.963
- Jongmal.
- Yeah?

00:50:49.046 --> 00:50:51.340
I actually have to go somewhere, okay?
Cover for me, would you?

00:50:51.423 --> 00:50:52.800
What?

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.677
Wait, you're skipping out again?

00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:57.638
Come on. Hey!

00:51:17.366 --> 00:51:19.368
GOOD LUCK COFFEE SHOP

00:51:19.451 --> 00:51:22.288
- Hey, come back soon, all right?
- Okay.

00:51:23.831 --> 00:51:26.500
In one ear and out the other.

00:51:26.584 --> 00:51:28.752
Ugh, whatever. I don't care.

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:32.381
Any boats heading to Jeungdo?

00:51:32.464 --> 00:51:35.676
Jeungdo, huh? I'm not sure.

00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:37.720
"FIRE STRIKES WITHOUT WARNING,
LET'S ALL STAY ALERT"

00:51:37.803 --> 00:51:40.556
Excuse me, sir. Are there
any boats heading to Jeungdo?

00:51:40.639 --> 00:51:42.224
Jeungdo?
You missed the last one.

00:51:45.144 --> 00:51:46.145
Hey.

00:51:47.605 --> 00:51:49.607
- You're going to Jeungdo?
- Yeah.

00:51:51.358 --> 00:51:53.861
I'll give you a ride.
I was actually heading that way myself.

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:55.321
Are you sure?

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.781
Oh, geez, thank you.

00:51:57.865 --> 00:51:59.408
Watch your step when you get on.

00:51:59.491 --> 00:52:01.368
- Okay.
- Okay, go ahead.

00:52:03.871 --> 00:52:06.373
I got it, so go ahead and hop on.
Keep going.

00:52:23.432 --> 00:52:26.352
Hey, you're the waitress
at Good Luck Coffee, right?

00:52:26.435 --> 00:52:28.437
So then, what brings you to Jeungdo?

00:52:30.064 --> 00:52:31.565
Heading out there to see someone I know.

00:52:31.649 --> 00:52:33.025
Right, so who is it?

00:52:33.734 --> 00:52:35.944
What, you think Jeungdo's
some dinky little island?

00:52:36.528 --> 00:52:38.238
Who you meeting and where you going?

00:52:39.657 --> 00:52:42.159
Can you hurry up and take me
to where the folks from Seoul are at?

00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:43.410
Which folks are those?

00:52:43.494 --> 00:52:45.496
The ones that came from
Seoul and Busan, don't you know?

00:52:45.579 --> 00:52:49.416
Ah, that's those looters you mean, right?
What are you seeing them for?

00:52:50.209 --> 00:52:52.503
Ugh, wh-what's with the 20 questions?

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:54.880
Can't you just take me there quietly?

00:52:54.963 --> 00:52:58.467
What? I'm burning my own gas
and giving you a free ride.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:52:59.885
I can't even ask some questions?

00:53:04.223 --> 00:53:06.642
Hey, can I take you on a date?

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.271
You wanna get murdered?

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:16.068
Sure. I'd be happy
to die in your arms, sweetheart.

00:53:18.612 --> 00:53:20.030
Now come here.

00:53:22.825 --> 00:53:25.119
What are you doing? Get over here.

00:53:25.202 --> 00:53:28.455
Hey, if you don't listen to me,
I'll kill you.

00:53:28.539 --> 00:53:29.748
I said, come here!

00:53:33.127 --> 00:53:34.503
Attagirl. Nice and slow.

00:53:34.586 --> 00:53:36.380
If you're not careful,
you'll crack your head.

00:53:37.297 --> 00:53:39.842
Hey, don't be scared now. I'm good at it.

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:44.513
Here, right here.
Let's do this quickly and go.

00:53:44.596 --> 00:53:46.140
Come on. Hurry.

00:53:47.266 --> 00:53:49.059
I said, hurry up.

00:53:49.143 --> 00:53:50.227
What?

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:52.938
Wha... What the hell are you doing?

00:53:54.565 --> 00:53:55.607
I'll just swim over there.

00:53:55.691 --> 00:53:58.736
Listen, you crazy bitch,
where do you think you are right now?

00:53:58.819 --> 00:54:00.654
We're in the middle of the ocean.

00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:02.239
What?

00:54:08.036 --> 00:54:11.165
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:14.084
Hey! Are you out of your mind?
You trying to get yourself killed?

00:54:14.168 --> 00:54:15.836
Grab my hand! Grab it!

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:18.422
Come on, grab my hand now!

00:54:18.505 --> 00:54:21.175
You nutjob! Just...
Just get back on the boat!

00:54:22.509 --> 00:54:27.389
Fine, I promise I won't do anything,
so just get on! For Pete's sake!

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:29.641
Damn it!

00:54:32.019 --> 00:54:33.812
You'll get swept away and die out there!

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:37.399
Oh, man.

00:54:37.483 --> 00:54:40.110
Look, you're a total nutjob,
you know that?

00:54:40.194 --> 00:54:43.489
You know, I heard crazy things about you.

00:54:44.072 --> 00:54:45.908
Let's just calm down
and I'll take you there.

00:54:45.991 --> 00:54:48.660
Damn, you scared the shit out of me.
