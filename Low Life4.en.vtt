00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.013
Ooh, what have we got here?

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:15.390
All the assholes
in one place, huh?

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:17.809
What the heck? The Professor?

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:21.522
I was wondering who that was.
It's Mr. Ha of Gwangju.

00:00:21.605 --> 00:00:23.065
Ah, fucking hell.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:24.983
Hey, Seokbae.

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:28.278
What? I thought you were locked up.

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.030
What are you doing here?

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:32.574
I rushed over thinking
you'd be here sniffing around.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.201
How'd you get out?

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.246
Now how the hell does
any of that concern you?

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.206
Stop wasting your time out here.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.250
Go have a glass
of whatever it is you like to drink.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.919
I mean, since you're here
and you know the spot already,

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.921
why don't we just
kill two birds with one stone?

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.757
Hey, you're desperate enough
to pull these kind of tricks?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.260
What tricks? And who's desperate?

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:53.845
You know what hoops I had
to jump through to get him out of prison?

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.180
You think you can just freeload?

00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:58.350
Well, we could just
drop down there ourselves over and over.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.143
We're bound to find something.

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:03.438
Then go ahead and dive right on in.
What are you waiting for?

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:04.690
You watch yourself.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.610
When this is over… As soon as
this is over, I'm kicking your damn ass.

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:12.114
You laughing?

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:14.449
All right, let's not do this here.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.286
Let's go to Jeungdo and have a talk.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.954
What's there to even say?

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.414
Then should we just stay here?

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.249
We should figure this out.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:25.419
Fine.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:28.922
Guess we'll come up with something
once we start talking.

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:30.465
Hey, let's go.

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.051
Right, let's go to Jeungdo!

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:34.761
Okay.

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:36.847
- You little piece of shit.
- We'll see you there.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.724
- Just you wait.
- All right.

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.767
Let's move out.

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:43.895
Shit.

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:30.192

{\an8}

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.218
Dang, Jeungdo.

00:02:57.094 --> 00:02:59.179
- It's been a minute.
- It has, Boss.

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.056
You been before?
It's my first time here.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.142
{\an8}Right. This is where Sangbok lives,
isn't it?

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:07.145
{\an8}Oh, yeah. You're right.
Sangbok does live here.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.064
{\an8}Ah, man. How come we never come out here?

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:12.651
{\an8}Hey, Seokbae.
Let's just head to your shed.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:16.154
{\an8}- It's a bit of a mess.
Hold on. Where are we going now?

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:18.448
{\an8}He's got some drinks in his shed.

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:20.325
{\an8}You really think it's the time for that?

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.328
{\an8}Just chill out. We don't bite.

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:25.288
{\an8}

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:26.998
{\an8}Ugh, shit.

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:30.627
{\an8}You can survive a night in
a tiger's den if you keep your eyes open.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:34.631
{\an8}Still, this place is crawling
with hustlers and scammers.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:37.634
All right, enough outta you already.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.594
- Get your hands off me.
- Come on.

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.471
Hey, so, what's the move here?

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.850
What do you think?
We gotta come to a deal.

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.103
I mean, we can't let them have it.
So should we just take them out?

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:52.274
Are you crazy? What kinda stupid shit…

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:57.362
So, I was wondering, how'd you get out?

00:03:57.446 --> 00:04:01.158
Why? You thought you'd just get
to relax and have all the fun on your own?

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.035
Have fun? You can get
the hell outta here with that shit.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.037
I've kept my head down.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.167
Wow, this is nice.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.173
Here you are. Enjoy.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.806
Seonja, did you grow up around here?

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.311
Well, I was born in Beolgyo,
but I spent most of my time here in Mokpo.

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.229
So what's in Seoul then? Why there?

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:34.816
Don't really know
if I wanna tell you, if I'm being honest.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:38.236
Anyway, what made you
wanna go back to Seoul?

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.364
A job thing.

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:44.242
But seriously, why Seoul? Just say it.

00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:48.789
Okay, truth is…

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:53.460
I'm actually into fashion,
and design, and all kinds of outfits.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:55.712
I wanna try and get a job
at a clothing factory there.

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.756
Oh…

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:00.717
Check it out. This one was all me.

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.345
What do you think? Not bad, huh?

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:05.472
That'll only sell
in the countryside.

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.061
Whatever.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.313
People around here say I have
a good fashion sense.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:17.275
Don't worry. When I get a house,
you can be my housekeeper.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.110
You're being an asshole.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.696
I thought we were friends or something.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.165
- Where's this from?
- I just found it.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:36.211
Just found it. Sure you did.

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.714
Holy crap, this is silk.

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:42.592
This is swanky as hell.

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.053
But I'm curious,
what are you giving me this for?

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:48.348
- If you don't want it, gi-give it back.
- No, you already gave it to me.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:49.432
You can't take it back.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.270
Wow, it's so pretty!

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.897
Dang, it's nice.

00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:59.860
What if… what if someone calls the cops
because I look so fancy?

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:03.572
How do I look?

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.240
Well…

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.827
What kind of reaction is that?

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.788
Ugh, I think I look great.

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:14.624
Let's try it like this.

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:16.877
How's this?

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:23.341
Hey, Seokbae. Hit the lights.

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.261
Man, I don't even know
what we're doing.

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:31.433
Wow, look at that.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.643
- Whoa.
- Huh, not bad.

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:36.062
Dang, Seokbae,
you're loaded man.

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:38.315
What exactly is this place?

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:41.401
Well, mostly,
I just use it for storage.

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:42.944
I'll swing by now and then…

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:45.822
…kick back and relax, you know.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.949
Those chickens over there?

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.035
Yeah, the neighbors
take care of them for me.

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:52.954
Hey, if you wanna talk,
why don't we head inside first?

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:54.331
Hang on.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.126
We're all going inside to talk?

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.297
Well, I don't think we all have to.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.675
Instead, let's stick to the three of us.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:06.843
Yeah, why not?

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.804
If we all chime in,
we're never gonna get anywhere.

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:12.557
Be our guest. After you.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.227
Now that's damn funny.

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.480
Since when have I
been your guest?

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:22.400
When you're visiting, what else
would you be? The host?

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:24.569
You two go on ahead.

00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:26.321
Nature calls.

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:28.406
- Right now? Come on, man.
- Excuse me.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.868
- Hey, where's the toilet?
- Uh, it's over there.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.079
Okay, got wipes? Or anything?

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.872
There's straw rope.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:38.083
A straw rope? Fuck…

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.429
Hey, you got anything to eat around here?

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.598
I'll go take a look.

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.184
Thanks, I'm about to starve
to death here.

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:57.894
Hey, what you got?

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:00.689
I know I got kimchi and rice somewhere.

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:07.570
You three.

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:09.572
I wanna have a word.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.168
I have to be honest.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:26.631
Really can't believe you boys
would just stab me in the back like this

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:28.049
over some bits of pottery.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:30.969
Tell me what the hell I did
for you to treat me this way.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:34.472
I bought y'all drinks,
got y'all jobs, and got you your cut!

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:38.518
- So how could you do this to me?
- What's that supposed to mean?

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:41.187
You were the one
who ditched us first. Forget already?

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:42.564
Yeah, exactly.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.774
You started working
with Seokbae instead of us.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:47.193
- What were we supposed to do?
- The money ain't a lot.

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.779
They're giving me crumbs.
How am I supposed to split it?

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.698
Seokbae's got a kid to feed.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.867
- Whatever, man.
- Am I wrong?

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:57.078
Look, I didn't forget about y'all.

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:58.663
Got it all worked out in my head.

00:08:58.747 --> 00:08:59.998
That so?

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:01.791
Then how much you getting?

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.918
You cheeky little bastard.

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:06.880
How much are you getting?

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.131
I can't tell you.

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.134
Afraid that's a secret.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.219
A secret?

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.138
I'm sure it is.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.183
Just use your heads for a second.

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:21.186
Once they dig up all that pottery
and leave, guess who's still here?

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.937
Think you'll never see me again?

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:27.525
Once we bring in a fat haul,
who will I be drinking with?

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:28.902
I do everything with you.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.362
It's true, isn't it?

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:34.407
Well, in that case,
why don't you tell us first?

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:35.909
Screw you then, motherfuckers.

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.912
You have no damn loyalty.
Forget I said anything.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.583
He's giving us half, okay? You happy?

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:54.344
- What does that mean?
- Exactly that.

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:57.263
Everything we find here…
Half the market price.

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:59.265
How does he know how much that'll be?

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:01.851
He's a professional, of course he'd know.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.394
Does he have that kinda cash?

00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:09.067
Uh, the thing is…

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:12.403
…something's shady about that guy.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.573
Some bad vibes.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:23.164
Damn, that hurts. Shit.

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:26.459
Let's go. Come on.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:41.474
Oh man, they're all whispering
like little kids out there.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.811
They were spilling everything
as far as I could tell.

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:47.897
- What do we do?
- Let's just cut the bullshit and be clear.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:49.732
Why don't we work on different days?

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:54.112
{\an8}We can flip a coin, or roll dice,
or play cards. Whatever you wanna do.

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:56.197
And the winner gets to pick.

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.907
Why go through all that?

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:02.412
We already know where it is.
Just lend us the diver, it's that simple.

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:03.830
Don't worry about the money,

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.039
I got you covered.

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:06.875
Look, you're underestimating us.

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.878
If we keep our eyes peeled
in Bangchuk-ri waters day and night,

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.088
of course we'll find it sooner or later.

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.174
We'll all get nothing
if we fight over this.

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:15.300
Do you realize that?

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.887
I've got someone lined up
in Seoul who's willing to buy all of it.

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:22.640
After that, we break it down.
Then we can determine the cut per head.

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:26.144
My guy's Japanese,
so it'll be easier to sell.

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:28.813
And I got a guy in Gwangju, all right?

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:30.190
And the thing with my guy is…

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:33.568
…if I say it's a hundred,
he'll pay a hundred. No questions asked.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:34.652
Yeah?

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.113
The guy I've got would point
at the shelf and go,

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:40.325
"Give me everything from here to here."
I could even slip in fakes.

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:43.453
Think you're the only one?
I always sell out my stuff too.

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:45.872
All right, just forget it.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.249
Whatever happens out there,
I'll handle it on my own.

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.626
Hey, hey, wait.

00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:52.170
Why don't we do this?

00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:57.300
We can't get all
those ceramics out by ourselves.

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.510
Hiring more people
might mean word getting out.

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:01.512
And since we already know each other…

00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:04.182
…let's just do this together.

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:06.517
Okay, but how do we divide it all?

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.728
We'll just have to split it all evenly.

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:11.064
- Mm-hmm.
- You think that'll work?

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:14.192
The pieces aren't all worth
the same thing. You can't split that way.

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.444
We got two experts right here, don't we?

00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:19.072
Appraise the ceramics
and we'll figure it out after that.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:22.992
Sorry. Since my buyer's
in Japan, I'll need quality pieces.

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:27.413
Come on, I'll need quality
pieces too if I wanna sell anything.

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:30.875
Did I say you didn't?
Look, nice try, but this won't work.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.168
Water and oil don't mix.

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:35.380
Hey, you're not gonna walk outta here
in the middle of our conversation.

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:37.548
We've got nothing more
to say to each other.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.717
- I'm the one holding the key.
- What key?

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.135
You don't even know where the spot is.

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:42.512
- Let go.
- You shit.

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:43.972
I said let go.

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:46.099
Are you a thug, huh?

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.228
This is stupid.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.107
- Oh, damn it.
- Shit.

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.067
Son of a bitch.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.318
Hey! Let's go!

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:58.861
Damn idiots.

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:00.738
Shit.

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:04.033
I knew this would happen.

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:06.327
Fine, let's do it your way!

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.914
I'll be watching you like a hawk, okay?

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:12.083
I'll be sticking to you
like white on rice.

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.376
Let's see how you like that shit.

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.545
Can you believe
this stupid fucking asshole?

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.463
The fuck you just say, bitch?

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:19.966
- You wanna talk shit, huh?
- Keep your damn shirts on!

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:23.428
You gonna take your pants off too?

00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:25.013
All right, let's stop it here.

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:27.181
Call it a night for now.

00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:29.934
Clear your heads
and talk about it tomorrow.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.605
All right, then.

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:38.318
Ah, crap. I don't know if we can find
a place to stay.

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:43.322
- Why'd they take off their shirts?
- It's a long story.

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:45.742
Kid's always running hot.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.681
Oh, shit. Gotta hold it in…

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.310
There I go.

00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:20.359
Oh, shit.

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:23.404
Work with me.

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:26.115
Why the hell, would you sneak up on a man

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:29.118
who's clearly taking a piss?

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:31.788
Just join us and we could get it all.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.790
We wouldn't have to split the pot so much.

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.917
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.251
Ah, come on, man.

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:38.628
I'll cut you a good deal.

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:42.590
How's 30% of the profits sound? Damn, 30%.

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:44.425
- I said no.
- Wow.

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:46.844
What are you trying to pull over there?

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:55.853
Thing is, you're not even asking
the real question. It's pretty obvious.

00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:57.188
What's that?

00:14:57.271 --> 00:15:00.358
The fact that we're talking out here
instead of in prison.

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:02.944
I'm still supposed to be locked up.

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.823
You can ask me all you want.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.699
I'm afraid my lips are sealed.

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:19.293
Well, well. I wonder
what Mr. Big Shot from Seoul is up to now?

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:33.224
{\an8}THE SUNKEN TREASURE OFF DODEOKDO

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:50.074
Oh…

00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:53.035
You're still up, Mrs. Yang?

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:54.704
Hi, you're awake.

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:57.498
Would you like something to eat?

00:15:57.582 --> 00:16:00.877
No, it's okay.
I won't be up much longer.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.545
Hmm, okay.

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:03.963
Good night, Mrs. Yang.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.529
Hey, wake up.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:31.866
Hey now, get up. I'm going to work.
Aren't you gonna see me off?

00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:36.829
Ah, shit.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.956
Ow, my head hurts.

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:42.335
You were drinking like a fish last night.

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:45.296
What? Where are we?

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:47.506
In my room. Where do you think?

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.799
Don't say you forgot.

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.345
Wait, did I sleep here?

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.557
Do you remember what I said last night?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.353
Um, was it about that Busan guy?

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.230
You remember. Well, that's good.

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:05.524
That must mean
you remember your promise too, right?

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:06.943
What do you mean?

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:10.071
Uh, do you only remember
whatever you want to?

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:12.907
You said you'd talk to the madam,
and help me move to Seoul.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.325
Wha… Really?

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:17.119
Uh, you said there was
a clothing store I could work at.

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.537
You knew a big one over in Jongno.

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:21.207
- How am I getting you work?
- How the hell would I know?

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:26.003
Uh, wait, where are my clothes?

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:29.966
Hey.

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.009
Did we do it last night?

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:35.638
What? Don't tell me you forgot it all.

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:38.683
After you started getting all handsy
with me like this, we had sex, yeah.

00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:40.726
Ah, shit. You're kidding.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:42.645
Uh, was there anything else?

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.313
Yeah, you kept talking a lot.

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:47.066
It only takes a few drinks
for you to turn into a motormouth.

00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:50.027
Hey listen. Don't repeat anything I said
last night to anyone, for your own good.

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:51.362
You get me?

00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:53.030
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:54.907
Just forget everything
I said last night, okay?

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.952
I was just, you know,
talking shit to get into your pants.

00:17:58.035 --> 00:17:59.412
Shit.

00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:04.667
Hey, did…
did he say anything about pottery?

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.544
- The Busan guy?
- No, he didn't.

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:09.630
But he definitely had a gun in his bag.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:12.758
Gun?

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:14.802
Like, what kind of a gun? Like a pistol?

00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:16.596
Yeah, it looked real fancy.

00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:21.642
Seonja, tell your boyfriend
to eat something and sober up.

00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:25.688
Where you off to, cutie-pie?
There's food for you.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.440
Ah, shit.

00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:31.235
Damn it…

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:34.030
Shit.

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:35.781
It's cramped in here.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.908
Fuck.

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:42.204
Shit.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.707
I'm surprised you let him sleep
in here, though.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.168
I thought you couldn't stand men.

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:49.128
I might've played a little trick on him.

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:50.379
What'd you do?

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:52.048
He kept talking about buried things,

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:54.175
so I buried a little something.

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:55.885
Yeah, I bet you had fun

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.179
burying that little something something
last night.

00:18:58.262 --> 00:19:00.473
Let's go eat.

00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:04.226
Oh, shit.

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:08.189
Ah, shit.

00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:09.732
Ma'am? Ma'am!

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:12.276
- Hey.
- Oh, boy, why didn't you come sooner?

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.196
- Everyone's already gone out.
- Where'd they go?

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:17.490
Didn't they go to Jeungdo?

00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:20.242
Jeungdo?
W-When's the next boat heading there?

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:23.037
Well, to get out that way,
there's only two boats a day.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.331
And the morning one left a while ago.

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:27.792
Don't know
if there's a second boat in the afternoon.

00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:29.877
Uh, why'd I do that?

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.712
I shouldn't have drank.

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:36.717
Yeah. He went to catch the boat?

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:41.972
Guess he'll take the next one.
All right, ma'am. Thanks.

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.227
That idiot said he'd be here yesterday.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.562
Well, it ain't like we can watch him
round the clock anyway.

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:50.439
It'd be better
if we had Bokgeun here, though.

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:52.441
Ain't there
a way to flip him?

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:56.612
Also, how did Kim get him out?
I mean he was locked up.

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:58.698
He's got connections all over.

00:19:58.781 --> 00:20:01.033
I bet he knows someone
on the inside.

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:04.203
We should just kick their ass.
We outnumber these idiots with Heedong.

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:07.540
What's wrong?
Your blood boiling again?

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:12.128
Well, what if we all just worked together?

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:15.589
Hey, how're we supposed
to split the money then, huh?

00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:17.842
Why split it?
Just take it and bail.

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:21.512
What's the point in trying
to split it when we can take it all?

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:24.473
Wow, I like the way you think.

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:26.058
You're not as dumb as I thought.

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:30.521
Well, that's not a bad idea.

00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:43.951
Hey, yeah.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:47.830
What brings you here?

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:49.707
Uh, what the…

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:52.126
Hey there.

00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:53.461
Professor Kim.

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:56.422
Here, do you like melons?

00:20:57.631 --> 00:20:59.216
Could I have a word with you?

00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:05.931
I should tell you,

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.142
before we came down here,

00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:10.770
we placed
some pieces underwater.

00:21:14.523 --> 00:21:17.401
So, how many pieces are there?

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:20.863
Well, it's sure to be
a lot more than what we dig up out there.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.365
And, with your expert appraisal,

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:26.202
we could easily pull one over
on our buyer in Seoul.

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.162
So you don't lift a finger…

00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:30.164
And you still cash in, huh?

00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:31.332
Right.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:34.877
'Cause no one needs to die for these ones.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.464
In that case, you're raking
in all that cash by yourself.

00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:40.883
You can flip
that money several times over.

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:43.803
How we handle our sales,
that's our business.

00:21:43.886 --> 00:21:46.472
I'm here to try
and figure out something else, all right?

00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:47.556
Our impasse.

00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:51.101
You sure know how to wheel and deal.

00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:55.564
All right, which are you taking?
The ones you farmed?

00:22:03.447 --> 00:22:05.449
Let's include all the farmed pots.

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:08.410
Then we'll divvy it up.
Evenly, after costs.

00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:13.415
And those guys?

00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:17.294
Nah, they're not part of the deal.

00:22:17.378 --> 00:22:20.089
I mean, they're your guys.
You can handle it.

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:23.259
Wait. Wait a minute.

00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:27.721
Tell me, how are we gonna do this?
You, me, and…

00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:28.931
The Tiger.

00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:30.808
- And the Tiger?
- Three ways.

00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:34.144
And whoever's working for us,
we handle on our own.

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:36.647
What do you say?

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:40.734
Pretty damn good, huh?

00:22:42.444 --> 00:22:45.614
What is it?
Do you want it in writing, sir?

00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:49.410
Writing? Don't be silly.

00:22:49.493 --> 00:22:50.703
We're just digging salvage.

00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:55.332
All right, let's do this.

00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:11.348
Hello, sir. Welcome.

00:23:12.016 --> 00:23:14.643
- Hey, it's been a while.
- Yes, sir.

00:23:14.727 --> 00:23:17.021
- Right this way to the chairman.
- Wow.

00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:19.023
It's a fine day.

00:23:19.106 --> 00:23:21.734
Here. It's fully stocked.

00:23:21.817 --> 00:23:23.402
Oh, I couldn't.

00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:25.070
Thank you so much, Chairman Cheon.

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:31.118
So, uh, have you been out
for drinks much these days?

00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:33.287
No. Hardly ever.
Only when I see you.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.247
There's not enough time in the day for me.

00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:37.833
Oh, but you're taking care of the country.

00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:39.585
You have to find time for yourself.

00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:42.046
By the way, um… What was it again?

00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:44.423
- What?
- You mentioned starting a school?

00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:48.510
Oh.

00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:52.348
Well, you know, it's so chaotic out there.

00:23:53.349 --> 00:23:54.975
I just hold on to that one lifeline.

00:23:55.059 --> 00:23:57.311
Uh-huh. What do you mean?

00:23:57.394 --> 00:24:00.481
Well, of course I'm talking about you.

00:24:00.564 --> 00:24:04.026
Because you're the only one
I can count on these days.

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:07.655
Ah, geez. You're making
it sound bigger than it is.

00:24:07.738 --> 00:24:11.992
Oh, and also, I'm building a museum,
right there at the school.

00:24:12.076 --> 00:24:14.536
A cushy position for you after retirement.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.164
Settling down on campus
wouldn't be so bad.

00:24:17.247 --> 00:24:18.707
Museum, huh?

00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:20.501
What kind of museum is it?

00:24:20.584 --> 00:24:22.461
You know about the ship?

00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:24.964
The treasure ship that sank off Sinan.

00:24:25.047 --> 00:24:28.258
Well, I sent some people there,
to go and bring up the relics.

00:24:28.342 --> 00:24:29.677
That means you're breaking the law.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.930
Do you know how many times fisherman
have pulled them up already?

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:37.267
- Somebody's got to buy them.
- Well, in that case, um…

00:24:37.351 --> 00:24:40.854
Would you mind setting aside
some pieces for me to take?

00:24:40.938 --> 00:24:43.107
- What?
- Americans, you know.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.567
They're obsessed with everything oriental.

00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:48.195
I mean, give them a gift of that caliber,

00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:49.905
I swear they'll go head over heels.

00:24:49.989 --> 00:24:52.408
- Over the moon, even.
- I see.

00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:53.951
I'd love it if you could set aside

00:24:54.034 --> 00:24:56.078
a good deal of it.

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:57.830
There's a lot of hands
I'm gonna have to shake.

00:24:57.913 --> 00:25:00.708
I'll set aside
the very best pieces I can find.

00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:02.793
Ah, the drinks are hitting just right.

00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:04.461
Oh, here. Cheers.

00:25:07.589 --> 00:25:09.216
Look,
we've got too many people here.

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:11.010
We have to figure out
who's getting on the boat.

00:25:11.093 --> 00:25:13.220
Why can't we
just take two boats out there?

00:25:13.303 --> 00:25:15.681
We can't 'cause of the locals.
Let's take one boat.

00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:16.765
Why?

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:19.893
Back when they first
pulled it up, no one really gave a shit.

00:25:19.977 --> 00:25:22.521
But then, last year the navy showed up.

00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:24.189
That got people's attention quick.

00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:26.150
They put up a watch post,

00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:28.569
so if we take two boats out,
we'll get caught.

00:25:28.652 --> 00:25:30.320
So only one boat, that's for sure.

00:25:30.404 --> 00:25:32.448
Next, we'll need guys
who are gonna dive in the water.

00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:34.825
So then, how many people
are we talking here?

00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:38.787
If all of us get on,
we won't have room for the pottery.

00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:41.999
Uh, are you guys yapping
the whole time or what?

00:25:42.082 --> 00:25:43.709
Only one of us should be the leader.

00:25:43.792 --> 00:25:45.335
All right, then. I'll talk.

00:25:45.419 --> 00:25:48.047
No, no, no, no. For this one,
I should do the talking.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.548
Remember, I'm a professor.

00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:52.384
But I've got the most experience
selling these things.

00:25:52.468 --> 00:25:54.928
Well, if we're talking man power,
I've got the most guys.

00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:57.097
Listen up, the second
I make a call,

00:25:57.181 --> 00:26:00.059
a whole group of guys
will come running. You can bet on that.

00:26:01.477 --> 00:26:03.479
You don't think I have guys?
I'll make a call.

00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.481
Stay out of this
before you say something dumb.

00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:06.815
Hey, let's just cool down.

00:26:06.899 --> 00:26:08.817
Why don't we just go
and get a bigger boat?

00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:11.445
- That ought to fix this, right?
- I already told you we need a small one

00:26:11.528 --> 00:26:13.155
'cause anything bigger
will get us caught out there!

00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:14.740
Hey, hey, hey. Be quiet.

00:26:15.616 --> 00:26:19.453
Professor Kim. Hey, you too.
Let's have a talk.

00:26:21.455 --> 00:26:24.041
Ugh, what the hell is this shit?

00:26:29.088 --> 00:26:31.632
Hey, I don't wanna do this.
Let's all be adults.

00:26:31.715 --> 00:26:34.718
That's real rich from the guy
who is always trying to pull something.

00:26:34.802 --> 00:26:36.553
Look, we can't all get on the boat.

00:26:36.637 --> 00:26:39.515
You two are pottery experts.
You're not cut out for this.

00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:42.643
I'm not cut out
for this, am I?

00:26:42.726 --> 00:26:44.603
I've been raiding tombs for 30 years.

00:26:44.686 --> 00:26:47.648
Great, but when we're out there,
we need guys who can haul pottery.

00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:49.525
Do the appraisal when we get back.

00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:52.653
Yeah, 'cause you won't pull
a fast one on us and stash it away?

00:26:52.736 --> 00:26:54.404
You think I don't see your angle here?

00:26:57.825 --> 00:26:58.992
All right, sure.

00:26:59.535 --> 00:27:02.788
Once we're on this boat, we get out there
and we all do what we have to do.

00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:04.581
- Understand?
- Don't order me around.

00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:06.917
I know what I'm doing.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.295
- You better not slack off.
- Hey, Uncle.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:12.965
What the hell happened?

00:27:13.048 --> 00:27:14.883
Uh, what…
what's going on here?

00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:18.220
- We're doing it together.
- What?

00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:19.805
The pottery, what do you think?

00:27:19.888 --> 00:27:21.348
Oh, hey, kid.

00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:24.101
I tried hitting on that coffee shop girl,

00:27:24.184 --> 00:27:26.103
but she shot me down right down.

00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:29.773
Man, that chick's got the softest hands,
though, doesn't she?

00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:31.608
- Damn it.
- Wha…

00:27:31.692 --> 00:27:33.360
- What are you doing?
- Hey,

00:27:33.443 --> 00:27:35.988
- what do you think you're doing?
- Hey, Heedong.

00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:38.866
Is this guy usually this nuts?

00:27:39.658 --> 00:27:41.827
Come on. What's your problem?

00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:44.621
- Whoa. What the hell?
- Get down.

00:27:44.705 --> 00:27:45.706
You piece of shit!

00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:48.250
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey, come here.

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:50.878
What?

00:27:50.961 --> 00:27:52.421
That guy's carrying a gun.

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:54.506
Seonja said she saw it in his bag.

00:27:56.258 --> 00:27:58.427
- Hey, pick up my shit.
- Wait, this whole time you were with her?

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.595
Come on.

00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:03.223
I told you to be careful, you little shit.
Not go around town flapping your mouth.

00:28:04.224 --> 00:28:06.768
- Damn it.
- You need to get your shit together.

00:28:11.982 --> 00:28:13.692
Look, before we all get on.

00:28:14.568 --> 00:28:16.236
I need to check everyone's pockets.

00:28:18.655 --> 00:28:20.240
And who the fuck are you?

00:28:20.324 --> 00:28:22.451
Who the fuck are you
to go through my shit?

00:28:23.577 --> 00:28:24.620
Hey…

00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:26.413
Well, look what we got here.

00:28:26.496 --> 00:28:28.498
- Son of a bitch.
- Hey, give it here.

00:28:30.334 --> 00:28:33.378
If you have any useless crap like this,
let me see it.

00:28:33.462 --> 00:28:36.214
I got these nail clippers
right here.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.050
Are these okay to bring?

00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:39.843
They're not, give it here.

00:28:39.927 --> 00:28:41.386
Really?

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:43.805
Anything sharp or jagged, take it out now.

00:28:43.889 --> 00:28:46.099
No, there's no fucking way
this is gonna work.

00:28:46.892 --> 00:28:48.560
We got too many cooks in the kitchen.

00:28:49.144 --> 00:28:50.604
Fuck!

00:28:53.357 --> 00:28:54.608
The hell's his deal?

00:28:54.691 --> 00:28:56.735
Look, I spent years
on deep-sea fishing vessels.

00:28:57.486 --> 00:29:00.948
Once a boat goes out on the water,
the laws of the land don't apply.

00:29:01.031 --> 00:29:02.616
Does that mean chaos?

00:29:03.116 --> 00:29:05.327
Not quite. 'Cause we got
the captain there.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.371
The captain's word is the law!

00:29:08.205 --> 00:29:09.581
If we head out to sea like this,

00:29:09.665 --> 00:29:11.333
it's gonna be a fight
over who's in charge.

00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:14.586
He said stop and he said go.
It'll be a total shit show out there.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.172
He's got a point.
We're gonna need a leader.

00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:20.425
I say someone who knows
the sea should take the lead.

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:21.843
He's right.

00:29:21.927 --> 00:29:26.264
We ended up with a bigger crew,
but we have to work together out at sea.

00:29:26.348 --> 00:29:29.434
We'll need a boss.
One who can really make that happen, yeah?

00:29:29.518 --> 00:29:30.602
All right, then.

00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:32.646
Let's go ahead and pick the boss.

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:34.648
Let's do it then.

00:29:34.731 --> 00:29:36.900
Hi, I've been meaning to ask.

00:29:36.984 --> 00:29:40.696
Is there any chance
some pieces could be high-end?

00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:42.030
"High-end," you mean, uh…

00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:44.366
I need them
as a gift for someone.

00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:48.078
I'll need around 30.
The finest ones you can source.

00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:49.329
Uh, but…

00:29:49.413 --> 00:29:51.790
Chairman, would this be included
in the five million?

00:29:51.873 --> 00:29:54.459
Of course not.
This is a whole different thing.

00:29:54.543 --> 00:29:56.753
So make sure you get the best ones.

00:29:56.837 --> 00:29:59.840
Oh, of course, Chairman Cheon.
I'll scale things up a bit.

00:29:59.923 --> 00:30:01.174
Okay then.

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:07.639
Uh, has Jeonchul called recently?

00:30:08.348 --> 00:30:09.683
No.

00:30:09.766 --> 00:30:11.935
It's been a while since he reported in.

00:30:12.019 --> 00:30:15.564
They could've started working.
You can't make calls out at sea.

00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:19.609
So then, you're scaling things up?

00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:22.654
Yeah,
we had to change course.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.574
And what made you change your tune?

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:30.037
Assemblyman Kim agreed
he's going to back me, 100%.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:34.416
He's got a lot of palms to grease,
so he asked if I had anything good.

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:35.500
Anything good?

00:30:35.584 --> 00:30:37.544
Gifts military officers would like.

00:30:37.627 --> 00:30:41.840
These Americans,
they go crazy over oriental ceramics.

00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:44.301
That's good news.

00:30:44.384 --> 00:30:48.472
Really? The museum idea was
so repulsive to you. What changed?

00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:51.349
Well,
this is great if it helps us grow.

00:30:52.059 --> 00:30:54.436
But don't you think we can
do a lot more than this?

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:55.687
How so?

00:30:55.771 --> 00:30:59.107
Once word gets out, his bosses
and superiors will also want in.

00:30:59.191 --> 00:31:00.650
Stock up on ceramics.

00:31:00.734 --> 00:31:03.153
That way we can make real money
from the start.

00:31:03.236 --> 00:31:07.783
Since we need
pieces for the museum already,

00:31:09.034 --> 00:31:11.703
we might as well profit
while we're at it, yeah?

00:31:11.787 --> 00:31:12.788
Precisely.

00:31:13.288 --> 00:31:15.457
A museum's not going to draw attention.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.293
I mean we just need to put
a few real ones in the front.

00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:20.629
The rest we can put to greater use.

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:25.550
You sure got a damn sharp mind
for things like this.

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:29.346
Now…

00:31:29.429 --> 00:31:31.306
{\an8}Here's everything you need to know.

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:34.810
{\an8}I'm the guy who'll always
find a way to get a piece of the pie.

00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:37.604
{\an8}When it comes to money…

00:31:37.687 --> 00:31:39.231
…I'm like a moth to a flame,

00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:40.482
I just can't help it.

00:31:41.191 --> 00:31:44.027
They always ask how
I'm so good at sniffing out jackpots.

00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:48.365
So I tell them, "It's not money
that has a smell, it's people."

00:31:48.448 --> 00:31:51.451
And speaking from experience,
everyone here reeks.

00:31:51.535 --> 00:31:52.536
Y'all reek.

00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:54.496
Y'all reek of money.

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:57.290
{\an8}Our goal is to ensure that
this is fair and just.

00:31:57.374 --> 00:32:01.419
{\an8}All the while trying to get
the greatest payout we can get.

00:32:01.503 --> 00:32:03.463
Now, the key here

00:32:03.547 --> 00:32:07.259
is gonna be excavating first
and splitting the shares later.

00:32:07.342 --> 00:32:08.677
Let me say one more thing.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.179
{\an8}Well, the reason I should be
in charge here

00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:12.597
{\an8}is 'cause I was born to do it.

00:32:12.681 --> 00:32:15.142
{\an8}Even when I was in prison,
I was in charge.

00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:17.227
And obviously I'm the boss here now.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:21.398
And I bring out
the greatest energy in people.

00:32:21.481 --> 00:32:23.942
Like, uh, you do this, you do that.

00:32:24.025 --> 00:32:25.861
Roles. I hand those out.

00:32:31.366 --> 00:32:32.450
Seongcheol.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:34.870
What are you doing out here?

00:32:36.037 --> 00:32:38.665
Listen, Cheon? He's grabbing the reins.

00:32:38.748 --> 00:32:40.959
Oh, yeah?

00:32:41.042 --> 00:32:43.420
Not exactly sure
how he wants this race to play out.

00:32:43.503 --> 00:32:45.714
But one thing's for sure,
he definitely wants to run it.

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:49.593
I wonder what got into
that stubborn old man.

00:32:50.177 --> 00:32:51.178
I have no idea.

00:32:51.261 --> 00:32:53.471
Maybe he saw
the Grim Reaper in his dreams,

00:32:53.555 --> 00:32:55.765
or maybe it was
the gift to his wife that did it.

00:32:55.849 --> 00:32:58.143
What do you mean? What'd you give her?

00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:00.437
You don't need to know.

00:33:01.062 --> 00:33:04.065
Hey. The guy that Cheon wants me
to give the pottery to…

00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:06.651
I think he's a big shot,
at least from what I heard.

00:33:06.735 --> 00:33:09.196
We should probably give him
one of the pieces from Sinan.

00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:10.572
That's not a problem.

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:14.117
Celadon or white porcelain, just give him
whatever he wants, done deal.

00:33:14.784 --> 00:33:18.371
By the way,
how much did you promise Ha Yeongsu?

00:33:18.455 --> 00:33:19.456
What do you mean?

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:21.583
He'll want a bigger slice
for a bigger a haul.

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:22.792
Okay, look.

00:33:23.293 --> 00:33:25.086
Does he have any money or any guys?

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.380
Does he do anything
besides just sit there?

00:33:27.464 --> 00:33:31.176
Maybe not, but Ha Yeongsu is
the only appraisal expert you got.

00:33:31.927 --> 00:33:33.511
What if he tries something?

00:33:33.595 --> 00:33:35.931
Nah, he doesn't have
the guts to do that. No.

00:33:36.514 --> 00:33:38.183
He's a small-time grifter.

00:33:38.266 --> 00:33:40.393
If I throw him a little extra,
he'll fall in line quick.

00:33:40.477 --> 00:33:41.895
{\an8}-
Also,

00:33:41.978 --> 00:33:44.105
{\an8}there was this guy, Kim, in Daein-dong.

00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:46.024
{\an8}He was a Saemaul leader.

00:33:46.107 --> 00:33:48.235
{\an8}He'd sit in on
all sorts of big discussions

00:33:48.318 --> 00:33:50.111
at the table with President Park.

00:33:50.612 --> 00:33:54.032
He and I go way back, you know.

00:33:54.115 --> 00:33:55.283
Let me see…

00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:58.119
What elementary school did he go to…

00:33:58.662 --> 00:34:00.538
Was he in Daein-dong then?

00:34:00.622 --> 00:34:03.083
Im-dong sounds right though.

00:34:03.166 --> 00:34:05.877
Or maybe Ilpyeong Elementary, was that it?

00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:08.129
What's your point? Just get to it.

00:34:08.213 --> 00:34:10.799
Ah, well, so anyway…

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:12.425
What I'm trying to say is…

00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:16.638
I was wondering if it was necessary
or if it was just a waste

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:18.306
for me to tag along with y'all.

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:20.934
Then why don't you stay at the inn
and you can appraise all of it later.

00:34:21.017 --> 00:34:23.436
But sitting around drinking
and waiting out the clock,

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.731
well, that doesn't seem wise.
Now that would be a waste.

00:34:26.815 --> 00:34:30.318
If you look around we got
experts out the ass. Go back to Gwangju.

00:34:30.402 --> 00:34:33.071
Well, I came all this way,
so I don't want to leave with nothing.

00:34:33.154 --> 00:34:36.241
Obviously, in this life,
we're born with empty hands,

00:34:36.866 --> 00:34:38.702
and in death, we leave with empty hands.

00:34:38.785 --> 00:34:40.203
However, I'm involved now,

00:34:40.287 --> 00:34:42.914
so my conscience tells me
I have to contribute in some way.

00:34:42.998 --> 00:34:44.791
It'd be the right thing to do.

00:34:44.874 --> 00:34:48.962
Man, the Gwangju Tiger really
has a way with words now, doesn't he?

00:34:49.045 --> 00:34:50.880
I could tell just by looking,

00:34:50.964 --> 00:34:54.676
the instant
anyone here tried to take control,

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:56.845
no one else would abide or accept it, see?

00:34:57.512 --> 00:34:59.055
So, with that in mind,

00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:04.394
I ask for your support as I take it upon
myself to bear this heavy responsibility.

00:35:05.353 --> 00:35:08.106
As the only one here
without conflicting interests,

00:35:08.189 --> 00:35:10.567
I'd appreciate if
y'all would consider for this--

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.986
Well, we're gonna have fights
no matter who we choose.

00:35:13.612 --> 00:35:16.990
- Got a solid point.
- Wait, is this your first time out at sea?

00:35:17.073 --> 00:35:19.826
I took a boat out
to raid some tombs in Aphaedo.

00:35:19.909 --> 00:35:21.828
You wouldn't believe it,
absolutely terrible.

00:35:21.911 --> 00:35:24.539
If it's that awful,
why put yourself through it?

00:35:24.623 --> 00:35:26.416
Nothing succeeds without toil.

00:35:26.499 --> 00:35:29.377
And now it's become one
of my most cherished remembrances.

00:35:29.461 --> 00:35:31.880
I don't know if
this is the right call or not.

00:35:32.422 --> 00:35:34.758
Trying to avoid a puddle
but stepping in dog shit.

00:35:34.841 --> 00:35:37.469
I would like to remind y'all once again,

00:35:37.552 --> 00:35:39.971
that I'm purely acting
in everyone's interest.

00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:42.057
Could I get a round of applause?

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.475
Should I go on?

00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:45.518
I could do this all night.

00:35:45.602 --> 00:35:47.729
Yeah, that's more like it.

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:50.106
Why, thank you.

00:35:52.108 --> 00:35:55.862
All right, listen.
There are a lot of people, so be careful.

00:35:55.945 --> 00:35:58.657
{\an8}And make sure that
the weight on both sides is equal.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.741
{\an8}"THE FIRST BOSS
HA YEONG-SU"

00:36:00.867 --> 00:36:02.243
Go ahead.

00:36:02.327 --> 00:36:05.205
I'm the boss and my word is law,
all right?

00:36:05.747 --> 00:36:07.165
Hey, take this.

00:36:08.208 --> 00:36:09.209
Hey!

00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:12.504
Bokgeun, you're the one who knows
where it is, so we need you up front!

00:36:12.587 --> 00:36:15.048
- Here, take this with you too.
- Don't talk to me.

00:36:15.131 --> 00:36:16.758
I know what I'm doing.

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:19.511
Don't you think it'll sink
if everyone gets on?

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:22.222
You two stay here.
Heedong and I will check it out.

00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:23.306
Are you sure?

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.183
We're just gonna go
and check out the spot.

00:36:25.266 --> 00:36:28.061
Hey. One of you guys should come too.

00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:32.232
Hey, give it.

00:36:33.274 --> 00:36:35.568
Excuse me, coming through.

00:36:35.652 --> 00:36:37.862
- All right, hurry up.
- Get on already.

00:36:37.946 --> 00:36:40.073
Captain Hwang! Let's head out!

00:36:40.156 --> 00:36:42.409
Oh, man.

00:36:42.951 --> 00:36:45.662
This is killing me! How much longer?

00:36:46.996 --> 00:36:48.790
Just a little bit further now!

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:50.792
That's Dodeokdo over there!

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:52.919
Yeah!

00:36:53.002 --> 00:36:54.295
That's Sodando!

00:36:54.379 --> 00:36:57.382
Daedando! Naegaldo! Oegaldo!

00:36:57.465 --> 00:36:59.843
What's wrong?
Is there a problem here?

00:36:59.926 --> 00:37:01.928
Damn it, can you just give me a second?

00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:04.305
I was locked up for too long,
it ain't easy.

00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:05.807
You can't forget where it is!

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.143
Man, this is rough as shit.

00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:11.521
The current's so strong, of course
the navy couldn't haul it all out!

00:37:11.604 --> 00:37:13.148
We're barely moving!

00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:15.525
This boat's seriously a piece of shit!

00:37:15.608 --> 00:37:18.361
Yeah, I know.
I don't think this boat's going to cut it!

00:37:18.445 --> 00:37:20.155
Ah, fuck this.

00:37:20.238 --> 00:37:22.782
Somebody's going to end up dead
before we even find this shit.

00:37:23.408 --> 00:37:25.034
What, down there?

00:37:25.118 --> 00:37:26.619
- Here?
- Are you sure?

00:37:26.703 --> 00:37:28.788
- Yeah, hey. Stop!
- Hey, cut the engine already!

00:37:28.872 --> 00:37:30.707
We'll drift away if we just do that.

00:37:32.167 --> 00:37:35.795
I should be able to see, uh,
the head of Naegaldo and the tail of, uh…

00:37:35.879 --> 00:37:37.714
and the tail of Oegaldo from here!

00:37:37.797 --> 00:37:39.549
Ah, come on. Fuck!

00:37:39.632 --> 00:37:41.176
Does he even know where it is?

00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:42.969
- This motherfucker.
- Hey, you dumb asshat!

00:37:43.052 --> 00:37:45.096
You're going right back
if you don't find it!

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.640
Fuck me!

00:37:47.724 --> 00:37:49.392
It's right around here!

00:37:49.476 --> 00:37:52.187
What the fuck.
It all looks the same.

00:37:59.068 --> 00:38:00.069
Huh?

00:38:05.033 --> 00:38:06.743
Hey!

00:38:06.826 --> 00:38:08.912
There!

00:38:08.995 --> 00:38:11.247
- Wait, are you serious?
- It's there?

00:38:11.331 --> 00:38:13.500
- Yeah! I'm sure! There!
- Hurry, quick drop the anchor!

00:38:13.583 --> 00:38:16.044
Hurry up! Come on.

00:38:19.172 --> 00:38:20.173
Throw it down.

00:38:21.508 --> 00:38:23.593
Hey, Seokbae, get ready now!

00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:28.056
Oh, hey, Seongcheol!
Hey, Seongcheol.

00:38:29.474 --> 00:38:30.725
Here, here, here, here.

00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:36.064
So, I talked to Cheon
and set up a meeting with the big shot.

00:38:36.648 --> 00:38:37.899
Who is it?

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:40.109
The politician, Kim Myeonggu.

00:38:40.735 --> 00:38:43.988
I'm meeting him in a bit at a restaurant
for lunch, and you should join us.

00:38:44.072 --> 00:38:45.114
Who else is going?

00:38:45.198 --> 00:38:47.826
I think just him.
He wouldn't want anyone seeing this.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.329
Cheon really made a huge decision
this time around.

00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:54.123
I mean, the fact that he's leaving
this client and deal to me says a lot.

00:38:54.207 --> 00:38:56.042
It looks like you and Cheon
are in bed together

00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:57.460
for the time being, aren't you?

00:38:57.544 --> 00:39:00.338
Ugh, gross! Why would you
put that image in my head?

00:39:00.421 --> 00:39:02.048
Geez.

00:39:56.019 --> 00:39:57.562
- Oh! Hey.
- Oh, hey!

00:39:57.645 --> 00:39:59.772
Did you find anything?

00:39:59.856 --> 00:40:01.900
- Are we in the right spot?
- Nothing down there.

00:40:01.983 --> 00:40:04.819
You checked the whole area down there?

00:40:04.903 --> 00:40:06.779
I mean, I looked everywhere.
Nothing but dirt.

00:40:06.863 --> 00:40:09.449
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Sure you know where it is?

00:40:10.033 --> 00:40:13.077
Seokbae,
you should try searching over here.

00:40:13.161 --> 00:40:15.830
Hey, man, you want me
to search the whole sea floor?

00:40:16.456 --> 00:40:19.208
Look, damn it.
This here current is strong as all hell!

00:40:19.292 --> 00:40:20.793
I'm telling you, it's around here.

00:40:20.877 --> 00:40:22.295
Come on, try over this way.

00:40:22.378 --> 00:40:25.048
Hey, you're not the one diving,
you son of a bitch.

00:40:25.131 --> 00:40:27.258
- Just swim that way.
- Ah, hell with this.

00:40:27.342 --> 00:40:28.676
I'm exhausted, man.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.136
Search the whole area!

00:40:32.889 --> 00:40:34.641
Damn it.

00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:39.729
Hi, I'm sorry I'm so late.

00:40:39.812 --> 00:40:40.813
- Oh.
- No, it's okay.

00:40:40.897 --> 00:40:42.106
My meeting ran long.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:46.069
- So sorry.
- Don't worry about it, Mr. Kim.

00:40:46.152 --> 00:40:49.572
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
I'm Song Gitaek, an antiques dealer.

00:40:49.656 --> 00:40:51.783
Oh, wow, the pleasure's mine.

00:40:51.866 --> 00:40:53.368
- Kim Myeonggu.
- Hello.

00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:55.745
I'm Han Seongcheol. I work as a potter.

00:40:55.828 --> 00:40:57.538
- Right. Pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

00:40:57.622 --> 00:40:59.916
- All right. Let's sit down.
- Yes, of course.

00:41:01.584 --> 00:41:05.171
I know you have a really busy schedule,
so I appreciate you meeting with us today.

00:41:06.965 --> 00:41:10.468
- Mr. Kim, would you like your usual?
- Yeah, sure. I'll have the usual.

00:41:10.551 --> 00:41:12.095
You too. Go have dinner.

00:41:12.929 --> 00:41:15.014
From what I hear,

00:41:15.098 --> 00:41:17.392
you two gentlemen have
a lot of great pieces.

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:18.810
Right, yes, yes.

00:41:18.893 --> 00:41:22.730
I must admit we do have some fine pieces
in our collection, Mr. Kim.

00:41:22.814 --> 00:41:25.566
All right, well, are any of them
worth taking a look at?

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:26.818
Yes, of course.

00:41:26.901 --> 00:41:29.195
I got this one that's
extremely valuable and unique.

00:41:29.278 --> 00:41:31.197
It carries the true essence of Goryeo--

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.282
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:41:33.366 --> 00:41:34.909
Hey…

00:41:35.451 --> 00:41:38.162
Guys like me, we wouldn't get it
even if you explained it.

00:41:39.372 --> 00:41:42.333
Just go ahead and choose the ones
that are the best of their kind.

00:41:42.834 --> 00:41:45.461
Mmm. Well, what are you looking for?

00:41:45.545 --> 00:41:47.797
An obvious showpiece.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.881
Hmm?

00:41:48.965 --> 00:41:52.427
You know, something that gets you to go,
"Wow! That's a masterpiece."

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:55.346
If that's the case,
then I have this piece here.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.807
I really hope this one's to your tastes.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:01.019
It's white porcelain from
the Joseon dynasty, and it's very rare.

00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:05.148
If you look here, you'll see,
it's got a really magnificent color.

00:42:05.773 --> 00:42:06.774
What do you think?

00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:11.112
This is exactly what I don't want.

00:42:12.071 --> 00:42:15.116
It could have
an orchid painted right here.

00:42:16.451 --> 00:42:18.953
Or maybe some other kind of flowers,
you know?

00:42:19.454 --> 00:42:21.998
This is just plain white. It's no good.

00:42:22.081 --> 00:42:25.960
Mr. Kim,
how about something like this?

00:42:29.756 --> 00:42:33.926
This here is
a Yuan-dynasty-made water dropper.

00:42:35.595 --> 00:42:38.431
Wow, this is great.

00:42:38.514 --> 00:42:41.809
How nice.

00:42:42.769 --> 00:42:44.562
Look at this pattern!

00:42:44.645 --> 00:42:46.355
Just beautiful.

00:42:51.986 --> 00:42:54.530
Are you insane? What were you thinking?

00:42:55.156 --> 00:42:57.617
Looked like he was about to walk out
if I didn't do it.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.453
{\an8}Even if things were going that way,
you can't show him a fake.

00:43:00.536 --> 00:43:02.330
{\an8}I can't deal with you right now.

00:43:02.997 --> 00:43:04.290
You saw it in there.

00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:07.168
He couldn't even tell what was real.

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:09.754
Isn't this better for us?

00:43:09.837 --> 00:43:11.005
What do you mean?

00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:14.258
What if all they can find are just
plain pieces from Sinan, what then?

00:43:14.342 --> 00:43:17.053
- Hmm.
- Now we know what he likes.

00:43:17.136 --> 00:43:21.474
We should focus on
farming ones that are decorated like that.

00:43:22.975 --> 00:43:24.227
Mm-hmm.

00:44:29.625 --> 00:44:31.836
- I can't take this.
- Boss man.

00:44:31.919 --> 00:44:33.171
- What?
- What are you doing?

00:44:33.254 --> 00:44:36.007
To hell with this boss shit.

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:38.092
I don't want it. You be the boss.

00:44:38.176 --> 00:44:39.635
Nah, I'm good.

00:44:39.719 --> 00:44:42.263
Ah, at least
the water's calmed down a little.

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:45.099
It's only like this for a bit.
It's gonna get rough again soon.

00:44:45.933 --> 00:44:48.936
The sun's setting.
Once he's up, let's call it a day.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.731
- Uh-huh.
- You fucking bastard!

00:44:51.814 --> 00:44:53.274
What the hell is this, huh?

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:57.653
I got your ass out of prison
and you can't even find it, piece of shit.

00:44:59.572 --> 00:45:01.699
- Don't rock the boat.
- Gross.

00:45:15.755 --> 00:45:18.174
Hey, you were right!

00:45:20.468 --> 00:45:23.387
- We're gonna be rich!
- Take it!

00:45:25.014 --> 00:45:28.017
You have to be careful!
Here! Don't drop it, careful!

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.478
Hey, that's
a good-looking piece right there.

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:33.439
Come on,
I wanna look at it too! Let me see it!

00:45:35.107 --> 00:45:37.693
- Over here!
- Hey, is he okay?

00:45:37.777 --> 00:45:40.655
Wow. Now this is the real deal.
The real deal.

00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:43.616
- Did you see a lot? Did you?
- I couldn't really tell.

00:45:43.699 --> 00:45:45.618
- What?
- I couldn't see that well.

00:45:45.701 --> 00:45:47.828
- Can I see?
- Hey, careful.

00:45:47.912 --> 00:45:50.498
We've got to get a pump as soon as we can.

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:51.582
Like, for diving?

00:45:51.666 --> 00:45:54.252
Yeah. It supplies air
to the helmet diver.

00:45:54.335 --> 00:45:57.380
You keep it on the boat,
and pump air down through a hose.

00:45:57.463 --> 00:46:01.050
Oh, so one goes down with an air tank, and
the other guy goes down with the helmet?

00:46:01.133 --> 00:46:03.386
Yeah, we'll go in with the helmet,
we'll go in with the air tank--

00:46:03.469 --> 00:46:05.054
- And you'll go in!
- Yeah, and I'll go in.

00:46:05.137 --> 00:46:06.681
- And I'll go in!
- And you'll go in! Exactly!

00:46:07.223 --> 00:46:10.434
Everyone's going in! Come on,
man. It's too tough to dive alone.

00:46:10.518 --> 00:46:13.145
- Ah, hell nah!
- All right, all right! Back to Mokpo!

00:46:13.229 --> 00:46:15.564
- Yeah, yeah. Let's go.
- Let's get all the stuff ready to go!

00:46:17.984 --> 00:46:19.986
We found the goddamn pottery!

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:27.285
We went back to Mokpo
and started getting ready for the job.

00:46:27.368 --> 00:46:30.746
We mixed up the two groups and divided
the tasks so no one would try anything.

00:46:32.373 --> 00:46:33.374
Ow!

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:36.711
Seokbae, Beolgu, and Jeonchul
handled the diving gear and pump.

00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:39.547
While Daesik and Bokgeun took care of
the ropes and nets

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.048
for hauling everything up.

00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:44.552
Captain Hwang was in charge of
fuel for the boat and food for the trip.

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:48.556
Uncle Gwanseok, Professor Kim,
Mr. Ha and I handled everything else.

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.766
To make it fair,
we split things down the middle.

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:52.476
I want to sleep in my own room.

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.272
We have to stick together
before we go to Jeungdo.

00:46:56.981 --> 00:46:58.941
Let's just grin and bear it, Professor.

00:47:00.276 --> 00:47:01.902
What are we doing for food?

00:47:02.403 --> 00:47:03.696
We'll just have to eat out.

00:47:03.779 --> 00:47:06.949
Loose lips sink ships.
And too many drinks will get us talking.

00:47:07.033 --> 00:47:08.326
Let's cook our own meals.

00:47:08.409 --> 00:47:10.077
We're gonna have to buy groceries.

00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:15.875
I can't really cook.

00:47:15.958 --> 00:47:19.754
Come on now. How can a grown man
be afraid of a little cooking?

00:47:21.297 --> 00:47:22.882
Let's go. You're with me.

00:47:23.466 --> 00:47:25.843
- Go.
- Shit.

00:47:25.926 --> 00:47:28.554
My legs.

00:47:30.222 --> 00:47:32.475
All right, let's see.

00:47:32.558 --> 00:47:35.353
- How much is this?
- Oh, these are fresh.

00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:37.855
These ones here, how much for three?

00:47:38.481 --> 00:47:41.233
Those ones?
I'll let them go for 100 each.

00:47:41.317 --> 00:47:42.651
So just 300 won.

00:47:42.735 --> 00:47:44.987
How about I give you 200?

00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:46.405
Come on, you're kidding?

00:47:46.489 --> 00:47:49.367
I'd rather throw them out
instead of selling them at that price.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:51.327
Hey, come on now. Barter.

00:47:52.036 --> 00:47:55.456
Mr. Ha, who was born
in the year, month and hour of the Tiger,

00:47:55.539 --> 00:47:58.667
was like a predator out hunting
even when shopping for groceries.

00:47:59.168 --> 00:48:02.004
One, two, three. I'll go somewhere else!

00:48:02.922 --> 00:48:05.049
He was very meticulous with his work.

00:48:05.132 --> 00:48:08.010
He had a specific plan
for what to cook and in what order.

00:48:08.094 --> 00:48:10.679
You take the fish heads
and put them on one side.

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.393
You gotta quit smoking.
We're cooking here.

00:48:16.477 --> 00:48:17.937
Ah, man, what the hell?

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.563
Red light, green light!

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:23.567
- Hey, slow down.
- Careful.

00:48:23.651 --> 00:48:25.694
The kids' shoes
are already worn out?

00:48:25.778 --> 00:48:28.155
Yeah, they're busted in the front,

00:48:28.239 --> 00:48:29.949
so now their toes are sticking out.

00:48:30.783 --> 00:48:33.285
It's always something or other.
They should be studying

00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:34.620
instead of running around.

00:48:35.121 --> 00:48:36.956
And here I am busting my ass.

00:48:37.039 --> 00:48:39.458
What are you doing? Do you just
let them go out and play all day?

00:48:39.542 --> 00:48:40.876
Enough of that.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.254
Our baby girl,
her hospital bill was pretty high.

00:48:43.337 --> 00:48:45.339
- What should we do?
- How much?

00:48:45.423 --> 00:48:47.925
Five thousand won, including the medicine.

00:48:48.008 --> 00:48:51.804
What could possibly cost 5,000 won?
You trying to make us broke?

00:48:51.887 --> 00:48:54.473
I did it for her. Our daughter's sick.

00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:56.767
I need you to figure it out.

00:48:56.851 --> 00:48:59.019
Don't make things harder for me
while I'm working.

00:48:59.103 --> 00:49:00.146
Bye.

00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:08.988
I have another long call.
You wanna go first?

00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:10.781
It's all right. Go ahead.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:15.202
Geez, raising kids is no joke, huh?

00:49:17.413 --> 00:49:18.789
Are you married?

00:49:19.498 --> 00:49:21.709
I wouldn't really call it that.

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:24.044
Sometimes you're with someone,
sometimes you're not,

00:49:24.128 --> 00:49:25.963
and that's how the cookie crumbles.

00:49:27.298 --> 00:49:30.301
- By the way, where did you say you teach?
- Oh, well…

00:49:30.384 --> 00:49:33.095
I only did it for a few years,

00:49:33.179 --> 00:49:37.141
and to this day, people still call me
the professor, so I just go with it.

00:49:37.224 --> 00:49:38.267
So which university?

00:49:38.893 --> 00:49:40.060
What's it matter to you?

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.521
Would you even know if I told you?

00:49:42.605 --> 00:49:45.649
It was just some school.
Why are you prying?

00:49:52.531 --> 00:49:53.866
Professor, my ass.

00:49:53.949 --> 00:49:55.034
Yeah, that's right.

00:49:55.117 --> 00:49:57.661
Even if we were to use fakes,
they wouldn't last.

00:49:57.745 --> 00:49:59.163
We'll need genuine pieces either way.

00:49:59.246 --> 00:50:02.124
So I need you to find those as soon as
you can, especially decorated ones.

00:50:02.208 --> 00:50:04.251
All that aside,
you need to send more money.

00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:05.836
This is gonna take more than a few guys.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.713
How much more
are you asking for here?

00:50:07.796 --> 00:50:10.549
Will you stop being cheap?
Just send me a good amount.

00:50:10.633 --> 00:50:12.301
There's a couple of guys
I need to keep quiet.

00:50:12.384 --> 00:50:15.179
Listen, I've only got so much cash
I can give you.

00:50:15.262 --> 00:50:17.389
Anything more
and I need to get it from Cheon.

00:50:17.473 --> 00:50:18.891
And I'll need a good reason to ask.

00:50:18.974 --> 00:50:21.519
That's on you to figure out.
'Cause we're outta time here.

00:50:21.602 --> 00:50:25.314
Wow, you're asking for money
when you don't even know where it's going?

00:50:25.397 --> 00:50:27.358
Who's gonna deal with the consequences?

00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:28.817
It's for the excavation.

00:50:28.901 --> 00:50:31.362
It's costing a lot more
than everyone thought it would.

00:50:31.445 --> 00:50:34.949
I thought you said you would cover it.
The excavation costs were on you.

00:50:35.032 --> 00:50:36.825
I'm completely in over my head here, sir,

00:50:36.909 --> 00:50:39.203
and that's why I'm reaching out
to ask you to help us both.

00:50:39.286 --> 00:50:42.831
And in return, I'll put pieces aside that
I think the Assemblyman would like.

00:50:42.915 --> 00:50:45.167
Well, that was already a given, you know.

00:50:46.126 --> 00:50:48.796
You wanna send money
to people you can't keep track of?

00:50:48.879 --> 00:50:51.298
- What the hell are you thinking?
- Well, it's just…

00:50:51.382 --> 00:50:53.801
The thing is I can't really
explain everything in detail right now…

00:50:53.884 --> 00:50:57.221
Forget it. I can't send it
if I don't know where it's going, okay?

00:50:57.304 --> 00:50:58.514
End of discussion.

00:50:58.597 --> 00:51:02.893
Then the second request you made
at Seoul Station, I'm sure you remember.

00:51:03.852 --> 00:51:07.690
Unfortunately, he says
he won't do it unless he's paid first.

00:51:11.318 --> 00:51:12.570
Oh, that's, uh…

00:51:13.612 --> 00:51:16.824
Uh, let's talk tomorrow.
We'll work it out. Mmm.

00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:19.535
What was that?

00:51:19.618 --> 00:51:22.162
Well, that was Song calling.

00:51:22.955 --> 00:51:27.459
Apparently, the guys he sent,
they keep pestering him for more money.

00:51:28.877 --> 00:51:30.296
I'll go check on them myself.

00:51:31.797 --> 00:51:33.340
Why would you go there?

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.594
I'll take Kim and Park, I won't go alone.

00:51:37.303 --> 00:51:39.888
There's something fishy about it,
so I want to take a look.

00:51:45.561 --> 00:51:48.022
Wouldn't it be great if I went
to see if they really need the money

00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:49.231
and then give it to them?

00:51:50.024 --> 00:51:51.775
And like I said, I won't be alone.

00:51:53.819 --> 00:51:57.906
Then, while you're at it,

00:51:58.699 --> 00:52:03.662
go check out the lands in Suwon,
Daedeok and Yeongi too if you can.

00:52:03.746 --> 00:52:05.205
Wait, you're actually letting me go?

00:52:05.289 --> 00:52:08.626
Would you mind if I visit the sea?

00:52:08.709 --> 00:52:11.337
The new capital's
going to be administrative.

00:52:12.463 --> 00:52:14.715
So I should take a look
before things get heated.

00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:18.844
So you're sending me
to scout the land instead of the pottery?

00:52:18.927 --> 00:52:21.972
Forget it if you don't want to.

00:52:22.056 --> 00:52:23.390
Uh…

00:52:23.474 --> 00:52:26.894
Of course I do.
I'll go scour the whole entire area.

00:52:27.519 --> 00:52:31.482
Ah, seeing everything,
it'll take a few days.

00:52:39.573 --> 00:52:41.784
{\an8}Where the hell's Professor Kim?

00:52:41.867 --> 00:52:43.869
Bring him out here this minute
or you're dead.

00:52:43.952 --> 00:52:46.163
Oh, the professor,
that little weasel bastard,

00:52:46.246 --> 00:52:47.665
he just scuttled off into the night?

00:52:47.748 --> 00:52:49.792
If you can't bring him
in front of me right now,

00:52:49.875 --> 00:52:51.543
then at least take back your trash

00:52:51.627 --> 00:52:53.420
and give me back everything
you took from me that day!

00:52:53.504 --> 00:52:55.464
I just sell pottery here, that's all.

00:52:55.547 --> 00:52:57.216
I was just sitting right here.

00:52:57.299 --> 00:52:59.343
It was the professor
who was doing all the talking.

00:52:59.426 --> 00:53:01.428
Geez, do you think
I'm a beggar or something?

00:53:01.512 --> 00:53:03.889
Why would I scam you
in order to make money, huh?

00:53:03.972 --> 00:53:06.392
Wow, lady, I'm surprised you can
keep a straight face

00:53:06.475 --> 00:53:09.269
after selling that trash to me.
Give me my stuff right now!

00:53:09.353 --> 00:53:12.481
Listen, junior, you better learn.
When it comes to antiques,

00:53:12.564 --> 00:53:15.150
the best thing you can do
is accept that you're gonna get scammed.

00:53:15.234 --> 00:53:18.070
What do you think, you're the only one
who's ever been made a mark?

00:53:18.153 --> 00:53:21.240
Wow, I'm shocked, you idiot.
You think that makes it better, huh?

00:53:21.323 --> 00:53:22.449
Who's the real idiot?

00:53:22.533 --> 00:53:25.244
- The con artist or the conned?
- Fine, let's do this then!

00:53:25.327 --> 00:53:26.870
All right, let's do this.

00:53:27.663 --> 00:53:29.331
Kim, where is he?

00:53:29.915 --> 00:53:32.918
- Oh, no.
- So?

00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:34.378
- You ready to talk?
- What are you doing?

00:53:34.461 --> 00:53:38.215
Or should I break another one?
Bring that bastard here now! Shit!

00:53:38.298 --> 00:53:39.717
Please! Just go!

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.385
Just shut it!

00:53:41.468 --> 00:53:43.512
You better bring that asshole here
right now!

00:53:43.595 --> 00:53:44.596
DEOKSAN ANTIQUE SHOP

00:53:53.939 --> 00:53:56.567
Hey, Ma.

00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:58.527
You celebrate your birthday
or something, huh?

00:53:59.695 --> 00:54:02.531
Shit, they're all busted. Fucking hell.

00:54:05.617 --> 00:54:08.829
I might be a shitty son, yeah?

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:12.082
Still wish I got an invitation
to this party, you know?

00:54:12.166 --> 00:54:13.292
Listen.

00:54:14.376 --> 00:54:16.795
Go find and bring Professor Kim here.

00:54:16.879 --> 00:54:20.215
You do that and I'll talk to your dad
about getting you a boat.

00:54:20.758 --> 00:54:22.551
Hey, Ma, you serious?

00:54:22.634 --> 00:54:25.012
Dang, even the tightwad can change, huh?

00:54:25.095 --> 00:54:27.639
Mokpo's where he's at.
Small fishing village there.

00:54:28.682 --> 00:54:30.768
Bring him back in one piece, you hear me?

00:54:31.393 --> 00:54:32.394
Got it.

00:54:33.395 --> 00:54:34.646
Hey, tightwad.

00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:35.731
Tightwad!

00:54:35.814 --> 00:54:37.733
You gotta keep your word, all right?

00:54:38.358 --> 00:54:39.568
Okay?

00:54:41.528 --> 00:54:42.738
Tightwad.

00:54:46.533 --> 00:54:50.287
Where did you get
this trash? Damn, man.

00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:52.789
Take a look at the edges.
Make sure they aren't ripped.

00:54:52.873 --> 00:54:55.459
This thing's old as hell.
It's been through it.

00:54:55.542 --> 00:54:56.627
It's nothing but rips.

00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:58.670
Here.
I think this will do, right?

00:54:58.754 --> 00:54:59.755
Let me see.

00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:04.301
Yeah, looks good. So how many dives
can you do in one day?

00:55:04.384 --> 00:55:06.261
Ah, with that nasty current,

00:55:06.345 --> 00:55:08.514
think I could do a couple,
then I'll be burnt out.

00:55:08.597 --> 00:55:12.601
A couple?
Guess we gotta get it right, every dive.

00:55:12.684 --> 00:55:14.478
The helmet divers can
load up these here nets,

00:55:14.561 --> 00:55:16.563
and we'll pull 'em out, all nice and easy.

00:55:16.647 --> 00:55:20.025
They already did another excavation,
and I bet they pulled out a ton.

00:55:20.108 --> 00:55:22.694
- And there were looters too.
- Is there anything there then?

00:55:22.778 --> 00:55:25.489
Everything the navy salvaged,
all of it was junk.

00:55:25.572 --> 00:55:27.533
The real ones are still there,
buried at the bottom.

00:55:27.616 --> 00:55:32.204
That area was flat, whole thing
was all solid mud stretching a kilometer.

00:55:32.287 --> 00:55:34.790
- So how do you get it out of the mud?
- Use your hands.

00:55:34.873 --> 00:55:37.292
You gotta do it slowly and it'll come out.

00:55:37.376 --> 00:55:40.504
Well, we gotta wrap this up
before they start excavating again.

00:55:40.587 --> 00:55:42.464
Should I talk to Honggi?

00:55:42.548 --> 00:55:45.008
And ask when they're coming back?
What do you reckon?

00:55:45.092 --> 00:55:46.760
I bet he won't tell us.

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:49.221
Well, at least he still
listens to you, doesn't he?

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.641
And to think that asshole
used to be my lackey

00:55:52.724 --> 00:55:54.309
back when we were all in school together.

00:55:54.393 --> 00:55:57.145
But ever since he became a fucking cop,
he acts like we're idiots.

00:55:57.229 --> 00:55:58.689
If I ask him a favor,

00:55:58.772 --> 00:56:00.232
I gotta sit through a two-hour lecture.

00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:02.442
- You should still ask.
- Hi, this is the Peace Inn.

00:56:02.526 --> 00:56:04.194
If the dates overlap, we're fucked.

00:56:05.279 --> 00:56:07.531
Mr. Oh Gwanseok?
You've got a call.

00:56:07.614 --> 00:56:08.740
- Yeah.
- Here.

00:56:11.159 --> 00:56:12.160
Thank you.

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:14.496
Hello? This is Oh Gwanseok.

00:56:15.122 --> 00:56:16.123
Mr. Song.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.042
Huh?

00:56:19.126 --> 00:56:20.377
His wife's coming?

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:22.087
Yeah, all right.

00:56:22.713 --> 00:56:24.006
I'll get her myself then.

00:56:24.089 --> 00:56:25.090
Sounds good.

00:56:25.173 --> 00:56:27.384
Who was it?

00:56:27.467 --> 00:56:28.885
Song called.

00:56:28.969 --> 00:56:31.138
Cheon's wife, she's coming here.

00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:33.807
- You serious?
- She'll be here tomorrow afternoon.

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:36.184
We have to
push the schedule back a little.

00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:40.314
Look here. Who's so important
that you're pushing the schedule?

00:56:40.397 --> 00:56:43.442
You don't need to know. Back to work.

00:56:43.525 --> 00:56:44.860
Hey, care to repeat that?

00:56:48.864 --> 00:56:53.744
{\an8}THE NEXT DAY

00:56:53.827 --> 00:56:55.704
{\an8}It just had to rain while I'm here.

00:57:05.839 --> 00:57:08.925
Oh, damn. Well, that blows.

00:57:12.179 --> 00:57:15.932
Damn it. Oh, what the hell?
Son of a bitch.

00:57:19.353 --> 00:57:20.604
Ma'am, he's here.

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.067
Hi there.

00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:30.030
Welcome, ma'am.

00:57:30.739 --> 00:57:32.366
Oh, you came to pick me up?

00:57:33.367 --> 00:57:35.494
It just seemed like
the proper thing to do.

00:57:35.577 --> 00:57:37.621
- Lead the way.
- Yes, let's go.

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:41.333
Hey, man. Can I borrow a match?

00:57:41.416 --> 00:57:42.793
Sorry, I don't smoke.

00:57:42.876 --> 00:57:44.127
Uh, have you got a light?

00:57:48.256 --> 00:57:49.299
Are you from Busan?

00:57:50.258 --> 00:57:53.095
Why? Why are you asking?

00:57:53.178 --> 00:57:55.013
I just noticed your accent, that's all.

00:58:02.646 --> 00:58:05.524
Just go ahead and keep on walking
like you were gonna, little guy.

00:58:05.607 --> 00:58:07.609
Son of a bitch, better watch yourself.

00:58:08.402 --> 00:58:09.611
What'd you say?

00:58:12.239 --> 00:58:14.116
I said, watch yourself, fat ass.

00:58:15.826 --> 00:58:18.578
Go ahead and let me know
when you're done talking

00:58:18.662 --> 00:58:20.205
and I'll drop your ass in one hit.

00:58:33.427 --> 00:58:35.429
{\an8}
