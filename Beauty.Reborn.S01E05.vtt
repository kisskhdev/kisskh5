00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.200
I'm sorry for everything I've done before.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.760
I don't even know
why I treated you so badly.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.160
But from now on,
I promise I won't do it again.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.120
Your father's muscular heart disease

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.080
has been getting worse, and right now,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.440
it's reached a critical stage.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.520
I can help you.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.080
It's just that… you'll have to marry me.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.520
I accept your offer.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.840
But it's only a marriage in name.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.440
Don't you dare lay a finger on me.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.000
Agreed.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.880
Did Ms. Sarah turn you down?

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.400
Not just turn me down,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.040
she's marrying Din.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.600
You brought Eyes to see me,
hoping I'd get distracted.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.120
So, I showed you

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.320
it didn't work.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.480
Sara and I will never fall apart
over your cheap tricks.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.440
Please don't take Din's side.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.200
You're the only one I've got left.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.680
But I'm not taking your side either.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.960
I told you already.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.600
I don't approve of you
using that woman as a tool.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.200
But Eyes, she…

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.800
I came to see you because of Din.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.000
He used Ms. Sarah to get at me.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.320
But they're actually getting married.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.160
That's part of Din's plan.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.520
Even though I don't have solid proof yet

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.320
why Ms. Sarah agreed
to marry him so easily,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.200
I'll never let him ruin her life.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.920
You really think
Din doesn't love Ms. Sarah?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.360
He's my brother. Of course, I know him.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.680
What's wrong with you?
Why did you call so early this morning?

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.400
Has the gift set sample arrived yet?

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.280
Changing the subject, huh?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.160
I'm not changing the subject.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.760
It's work hours now,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.160
so it's right we talk about work.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.280
I've told you many times already.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.080
It's arrived, sir.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.959
We're looking for a test group.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.200
Then we'll evaluate and decide…

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.360
EYES

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.280
Hello?

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.360
Din.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.240
Are you free today?

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.240
I really need to talk to you.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.880
Can you come to my condo?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.480
If you're not comfortable,
we can meet somewhere else.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.160
I'm busy. I have work.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.040
Okay. I understand.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.360
Sorry for bothering you.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.920
Was that a work call just now?

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.200
Well, you're the one who keeps saying,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.800
"Work hours are for work."

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.080
Ms. Eyes called, didn't she?
No need to act cool.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.280
Our wedding is just
a business arrangement anyway.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.440
Who am I to blame you?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.560
You should get back to work.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.200
Suit yourself.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.680
But my offer still stands.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.040
Call off the wedding.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.840
Let me pay for Dad's treatment
in installments.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.160
Then you can go back to your ex
or date whoever you want.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.200
At least we won't have
to keep pretending like this.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.840
What the hell did I just say?

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.520
What are you doing?

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.720
Come with me.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.720
To where? Hey!

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.600
Didn't you just tell me to get
back to work? What's your deal?

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.920
Hey! I'm supposed to meet with Toy!

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.640
I'm giving him
the gift set samples for testing.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.040
You dragging me off like this,
I'm gonna be late.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.920
Stop complaining already.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.160
Let's just get this over with.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.200
Get what over with? I've been asking
the whole way and you won't tell me.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.160
This is Eyes's condo.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.960
And?

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.840
She called and asked me to come.
Not sure what about.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.800
So, I brought you along.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.640
I'll just tell her straight up
that we're getting married.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.800
-What?
-Twice.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.760
You've used me twice today already.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.360
If you're trying to move on, why can't you
do it yourself? Why drag me into it?

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.680
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.480
Fine, I admit it.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.880
I didn't dare tell her myself.
Just help me out this once, please.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.120
When the company makes a profit,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.800
you owe me a bonus. Deal?

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.440
Greedy.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.000
Deal or not?

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.440
Okay, deal.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.640
Eyes.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.520
Eyes, I'm coming in.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.160
Eyes?

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.080
Eyes! Eyes!

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.320
Eyes! Eyes! Eyes.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.080
Eyes!

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.200
Eyes! Eyes!

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.360
Eyes!

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.440
Eyes! Eyes!

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.120
Hello, please send an ambulance here.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.159
Eyes… Eyes, can you hear me? Eyes?

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.720
Thank you.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.640
If you hadn't helped, I wouldn't…

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.760
have known what to do.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.320
Ms. Eyes has regained consciousness.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.800
Then… I'll be going now.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.720
Thank you.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.360
Are you a human or the Yellow River?

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.440
You really let your fiancé

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.800
stay with his ex?

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.200
Did you expect me to make a scene?

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.200
"Oh my, Mr. Din, come back right now!

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.840
You can't stay alone together!"

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.400
Even saying it out loud
is so damn annoying.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.800
Alright, you diva.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.320
Less than a month after getting married,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.240
he started showing his true colors.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.560
I couldn't stand his constant womanizing,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.800
and we ended up divorced.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.720
But I didn't want to come back
to Thailand. It felt like failure.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.400
So, you started a business there.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.440
After the divorce, I got a chunk of money.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.560
But I wasn't smart with it,
and it ran out.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.880
Then I fell into informal debt.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.520
That's why I had to come back here, Din.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.400
I really messed up, didn't I?
Repeating the same mistakes?

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.520
Eyes…

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.360
Listen to me.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.360
People who work

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.560
make mistakes.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.040
The only ones who never do

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.800
are the ones who never try anything.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.760
What matters

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.880
is what happens next,

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.160
what you'll do from here.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.720
I really don't know, Din.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.040
Um…

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.320
Wait, wait, hold on.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.600
-Yes?
-Sarach, try this pose.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.560
One hand at the nape,
the other in your pocket.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.600
Nice, change it up a bit.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.160
Ah, like that, yes!

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.680
Wow, so handsome.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.960
Looking great.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.720
Oh my God.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.840
Thank you. I'll head off now.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.200
Where are you rushing off to, Sarach?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.920
Come to a party with me first.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.240
Your makeup and hair look good today.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.400
Trust me. This place will be fun.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.960
Sorry, I have to see
my dad at the hospital.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.320
Thank you so much
for giving me this opportunity.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.360
Mhm.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.680
I already sent the photos.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.920
Boss.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.560
Got a new boy to introduce.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.440
He's fresh and looks great.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.600
I'll send you the pics.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.400
Okay, thanks.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.680
Where are you headed?

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.280
Mmm.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.680
You actually eat street food like this?

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.720
I thought you only went
to thousand-baht-a-meal mall restaurants.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.360
Sorry, I look so tasteful,
you got the wrong idea.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.800
I've got good taste.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.600
But honestly, I can eat street food too.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.880
You've been staring
at me forever. What's up?

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.640
Well, I just came to warn you. Be careful.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.280
The person who asked you
to work with him isn't exactly clean.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.320
Oh, Pong?

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.680
What's wrong with him?

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.120
He's…

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.480
kind of a scammer.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.480
I don't think he is.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.160
Because after the job,
he transferred the pay right away

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.480
and didn't take a commission.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.160
Whatever.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.240
Consider this my warning.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.120
Oh,

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.440
and thanks for the noodles.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.400
No problem.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.080
I just don't like owing people favors.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.320
Like my dad owing your family.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.880
Have some soy milk.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.920
If you drink coffee now, you won't sleep.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.080
Thanks.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.960
What made you come see me?

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.160
I needed someone to hear me out.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.240
And I couldn't think of anyone but you.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.520
Should I be happy about that?

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.640
That you think of me
when you have problems?

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.240
I think so.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.120
Not everyone
would get me to open up like that.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.800
How much personal money
do you have left right now?

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.000
Not enough to help Eyes.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.440
Because you already helped my dad.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.560
But actually,

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.160
I do have another way to help her.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.400
It's just…

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.520
I don't want to choose that way.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.440
Then let me rephrase.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.360
Between helping Ms. Eyes and not helping,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.720
which would make you feel worse afterward?

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.720
That's something
you have to decide for yourself.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.320
I can't make that call for you.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.520
There is only one thing I can do.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.480
What is it?

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.960
I'll stand by your side.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.080
No matter which choice you make,

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.000
or whatever comes from it,

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.680
I promise

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.880
I will be by your side.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.840
Yes, Pong?

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.800
Right now?

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.240
Yes, I'm free.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.560
Okay, I'll head out now. See you there.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.560
-Hello, Pong.
-Hi.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.080
I'm so sorry. This is so urgent.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.560
No worries.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.120
Go get changed. I've left clothes
in the dressing room.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.160
Okay, I'll change now.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.880
Alright.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.080
I transferred the money to you, Sarach.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.840
Yes, thank you, Pong.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.200
Why are you rushing home?

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.160
Come hang out with me first.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.640
I'm not available.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.160
Not available?

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.760
You can come with me willingly,

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.320
or I'll make you come.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.200
Make me?

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.640
Hey!

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.360
Let go!

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.480
How can you do this? It's illegal.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.440
Why can't I?

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.840
You did everything yourself in this clip.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.680
Where's the part where I forced you?

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.240
Gross.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.040
Don't get mouthy with me.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.040
If you go meet the client
properly with me,

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.200
you'll get paid well.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.560
And maybe I'll even
be kind enough to delete this clip.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.880
Well?

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.040
-Hm?
-Yeah.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.920
Huh? What?

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.120
Police!

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.800
What?

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.560
Take him!

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.560
-Go, go.
-Let me go!

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.760
Yo.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.880
I never thought he'd be that rotten.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.560
Too bad he escaped.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.880
He won't be free for long.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.360
And you. Before you accept work,
do some background checks.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.920
Is it that easy to check?

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.200
It's not.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.600
But if you try, you can find something.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.280
Otherwise, how could I help you?

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.200
Oh, you there!

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.240
Yes, you.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.480
Well… Hello.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.240
I run a modeling agency
and recruit talent.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.960
Here's my card.
Contact me if you're interested.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.040
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.840
Alright, caught a new prospect.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.240
"Scammer playing modeling agent

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.640
with name starting with P.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.200
Always uses photo shoots as an excuse,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.920
but really, it's a trafficking ring."

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.720
Once I was sure Pong was one of them,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.000
I went to the police.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.080
Luckily, they had leads.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.320
How did you know I had work today?

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.600
You seemed so confident
he wouldn't scam you,

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.440
so I thought
you might continue to take the gig.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.760
I told the cops to tail you.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.200
Luckily, they followed you
from the university.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.320
They caught him red-handed.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.560
Hey, I need to ask you something.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.920
What is it?

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.960
Please don't tell my sister about today.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.800
I don't want her to worry.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.320
-About Dad alone--
-Don't worry.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.480
It won't slip from my mouth.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.720
Promise?

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.680
-If my sister finds out, I'll kill you.
-Got it.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.040
You're the only one I'd do this for.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.160
Slowly.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.680
Don't forget to take your meds, okay?

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.840
Okay.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.960
Din.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.080
You transferred me this money?

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.240
It's company money.
I don't have that much myself.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.720
So, won't that get you in trouble?

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.160
Don't worry.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.280
I can handle it.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.160
Thank you so much, Din.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.480
When I have no one left,

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.360
you still won't abandon me.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.360
How could I ever abandon you?

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.160
No matter what happens,

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.960
we'll always be friends.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.240
I'll head back now,

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.840
so you can get some rest.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.120
No Chef's Table, really?

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.560
You want it?
How many chefs, how many tables?

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.000
Bring all the chefs. Chef-palooza!

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.400
Oh, Mr. Nam.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.200
Mr. Toy, why are you here?

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.760
He's here as a test subject
for the sample.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.840
Want to grab lunch together?

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.040
But it's the canteen,

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.320
not the lethal mortar-and-pestle
papaya salad again.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.680
It's fine. I'm swamped with work.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.560
Aren't you taking a lunch break?

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.480
I want to prove
I can work as well as anyone,

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.120
and that I'm reliable.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.920
Excuse me.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.240
Yes.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.520
Why did Mr. Apo say that?

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.000
Like he just can't let go.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.640
You're about to marry
his brother, you know.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.760
Exactly, headache material.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.480
Let's go.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.720
Really? The canteen? For real?

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.600
Din.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.320
I'm sorry for everything.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.880
Forget it, Eyes.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.400
It's in the past.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.880
No, Din. I still have to apologize.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.360
I'm sorry, Din.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.240
I'm sorry.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.360
I'm really sorry.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.000
Don't blame yourself.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.240
Up until now,

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.240
I've never been angry at you.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.280
Wow.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.440
I don't have that kind of money.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.840
But Din probably does.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.040
Why don't you try asking him?

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.640
I wouldn't dare to.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.320
You know what I did to him.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.640
Come on. Din's not the vindictive type.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.840
Since the breakup,

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.720
he's just been working, not seeing anyone.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.400
I think…

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.480
Din hasn't forgotten you.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.520
Is this because I'm a widow?

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.040
It's not like that, Eyes.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.480
-If it's not, then why?
-I'm getting married.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.640
Din.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.000
Mom, is something wrong?

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.360
Accounting called and told me

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.400
you withdrew two million
from the company advance funds.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.680
What did you use it for?

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.440
You used the advance
to help your ex pay her debts?

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.240
Are you out of your mind?

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.440
I'm really sorry

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.960
I messed with company funds.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.160
But I already spent my personal money
helping Uncle Suthee. It was necessary.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.640
So, you're saying
I forced you into this? Huh?

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.040
I didn't think that. You know that.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.320
Let's just say,

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.040
I'll return the company money
as fast as I can.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.040
How fast is "as fast as you can"?

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.880
Shareholders' meeting is in a few days.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.440
Even if this money
was within your authority to use,

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.000
if you used it for personal reasons,
you're done.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.760
Company account data is internal.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.960
No one outside will find out.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.520
Good. Confidence is one thing.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.880
But if something happens,
don't come asking for help.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.680
Can Din be that stupid?

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.400
Well, that helps. Thanks for the tip.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.360
Bitcoin up? Look at that grin.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.000
No.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.440
I just have something fun to do.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.480
Din.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.760
He signed a company advance

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.640
to help pay off his ex's debts.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.720
Eyes?

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.120
That old flame

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.120
will finish him off this time.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.560
Just wait and see.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.160
Dad.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.720
Why didn't you tell me
Dad moved back to a regular ward?

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.800
So that you could skip class?

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.000
You'll see when you get here.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.080
Dad moved sooner than the doctor expected.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.560
If this keeps up,
you might be allowed home in a few days.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.800
I also want to go home.
I'm sick of the hospital already.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.400
Uncle, I brought a gift basket to visit.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.320
Thank you, Mr. Din.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.880
I'll step outside for a bit,
so you two can talk properly.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.880
Uncle.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.920
I have something I need to tell you.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.960
Why so formal all of a sudden?

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.800
Well…

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.320
Sara and I…

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.480
We're getting married.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.159
What's up?

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:17.159
Yeah, hello, Rach?

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.400
Did you take my lecture notes?
I can't find them anywhere.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.199
Oh, really?

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.840
Can you look for it too?

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:29.120
So I can stop looking.
I've searched everywhere.

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:31.239
Okay, hang on. I'll call you back.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.000
Please look after my daughter.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.400
I'm really happy

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.320
that our families
are like one sheet of gold.

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:50.639
"One sheet of gold?"
What do you mean, Dad?

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.600
Come on.

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:55.120
What else would it mean?

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:59.480
It means Din and your sister
are going to get married.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.480
You said Din lent you money
for Dad's treatment,

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.240
so how did a wedding
happen all of a sudden?

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.160
Did you force her to marry you?

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.680
Why are you so quiet? Say something.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.360
You're the one who should be quiet!

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.400
Don't get aggressive
with elders like that! I--

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.440
-Dad!
-Uncle!

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.760
Dad.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.360
Sarach.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.200
I'll go after him.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.440
Sarach.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.200
Sarach.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.240
Sarach, wait.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.680
Sarach, wait. Listen to me first.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.120
What excuse are you going to give?

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.960
Yes, I lent her money.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.320
But I didn't force your sister
to marry me.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.640
Our families have always been close.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.880
But you've always taken advantage of us.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.000
Now you're using money
to make my sister marry you?

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.240
What will come next?

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.880
So, how about this?

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.440
Let time be the proof

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.640
that I didn't force Sara.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:19.000
If you didn't force her, then you and Sara
must really love each other, huh?

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.000
Hello.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.040
Hello.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.560
-Hello. Please come in.
-Hello. Please.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.960
-Hello. Please come in.
-Hello. I'll show you the way.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.080
Thanks for telling me to talk to Din.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.920
At first, I was hesitant.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.760
It's okay.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.240
We're all friends here.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.200
If Din hadn't helped,
I might not have made it.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.720
Anyway, thanks again, Nam.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.400
And thank you

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.600
for keeping my debt situation quiet.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.400
I'm not one for gossip.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.160
Congrats on clearing your debt.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.400
More like I changed creditors.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.880
At least a familiar face
puts less pressure on me.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.360
I'll still have to get the money
to clear Din's debt.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.200
I already told you

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.600
that Din

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.160
hasn't forgotten you.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.880
If he hadn't forgotten,
he wouldn't be getting married.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:02.440
Din said you know
the person he's marrying.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.520
From last quarter's results,

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:13.520
we recorded only a slight loss
from investing in a new product.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.960
Does anyone want more details?

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.440
Mr. Chakrit.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.760
What question do you have?

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.080
Here you go.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:39.640
Please take a look.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:49.080
The documents in everyone's hands
are evidence

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.280
of suspicious activity by the CEO.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.920
Now you've seen
that Mr. Pathawee used his authority

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.280
to transfer company advance funds

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.120
to an outside individual.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.720
And we heard

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.840
the recipient was his ex-girlfriend.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:24.120
Hey, live from the boardroom.
It's intense.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.920
Mr. Chakrit picked up

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.760
that Mr. Pathawee used
company funds for personal matters.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.800
Whoa, seriously?

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.360
Could that be true?

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.680
Seems unlikely.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.560
So…

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.520
Mr. Pathawee,
is what Mr. Chakrit said true?

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.360
Two million

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.600
was within the CEO's authority.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.320
But it's still wrong.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.280
As an executive,

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.880
you should be transparent, shouldn't you?

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.240
I admit it.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.120
I did use company money

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.240
for personal reasons.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.040
Now I hate my claustrophobia the most.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.960
I couln't even use the elevator!

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.320
See?

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.960
He's already admitted it himself.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.800
So, he must take responsibility
by resigning from his position.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.040
Isn't that right, Mr. Pathawee?

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.960
I'll beat you

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.080
the right way.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.680
And I'll make Ms. Sarah see my worth.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.160
If Nam says he won't give up on Ms. Sarah,

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.400
then I won't give up on you either.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.320
Is this Sarach's?

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.880
Yes. He was so upset,
he forgot to grab it all.

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.040
Call him right now and tell him.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.600
-Pong?
-You called the cops on me, didn't you?

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:39.600
Beat him up.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.880
