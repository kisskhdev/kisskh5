[Episode 12]

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.130
Let's go, Mr. Huang.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.060
Agency Chief Sawa is waiting.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.690
Wait, you went
to spy outside Sawa Agency?

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.910
Do you even know
what kind of place that is?

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.970
Is that how you
throw your life away?

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.850
But I still have to do my job.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.810
Right.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.640
You're the big boss
in the British Army Service Station.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.440
Yesterday, you went

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.950
sniffing around
the Bachongtian Club entrance,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.970
asking how many agents are
in their Special Operations Team.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.420
The day before, you were
at Lyun Coeng's warehouse,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.920
trying to find out
what goods they're smuggling.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.310
You think carrying
a vegetable basket is enough

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.470
to make people believe
you're a vegetable seller?

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.230
If I hadn't diverted those agents,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.970
you'd have been caught
more times than you can count.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:44.750
Don't you get it?

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.810
You're not cut out for this.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.579
Quit while you're ahead.

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.380
-Okay?
-You've been tailing me?

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.710
You owe me money.

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.290
If something happens to you,
who am I supposed to collect from?

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.690
Fine.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.450
Thank you, Yang Chang.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.220
I'll remember your advice

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.120
and work on improving my skills.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.640
Are you still planning
to go out and cause trouble?

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.540
Like I said,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.730
it's my duty.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.030
If you insist on doing this,

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.260
could you at least
be smarter about it?

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.910
If

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.470
you don't know how,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.390
find someone who does.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.230
Find who?

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.480
Find who?

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.450
Who, who?

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.970
Me!

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.579
Alright.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.070
As the Chief of the British Army
Service Station in Macau,

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.130
I, Mary Jones,

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.100
hereby appoint Mr. Yang Chang

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.950
as a covert intelligence operative
for this station.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.180
Mr. Yang Chang,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.510
welcome aboard.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.840
Hold on—

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.070
when hiring someone,
shouldn't we discuss the terms first?

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.810
How can we start
without agreeing on the conditions?

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.270
What terms? Go ahead.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.650
Three points.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.200
First,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.100
what's the pay?

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.690
Same as your previous salary
as a marine police officer, acceptable?

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.450
But I don't have funds right now—

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.280
it'll have to be on credit for now.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.870
Fine.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.370
Interest will be charged separately.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.870
And what you already owe me

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.530
will be settled in full later.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.640
Agreed.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.380
Second?

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.940
Division of duties.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.750
Well, the man handles
outside affairs,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.550
and the woman manages domestic matters.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.050
From now on,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.220
all external activities—

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.400
including reconnaissance,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.370
running errands,
gathering intelligence—

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.250
will fall under my responsibility.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.990
You'll

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.110
stay at the station,

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.170
overseeing logistics and internal affairs.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.770
And third?

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.340
Third is management.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.310
Without rules,
nothing gets done properly.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.200
Even a small service station like ours

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.930
needs a clear chain of command—

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.320
who's in charge,
whose word counts.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.880
So what are you proposing?

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.170
You're the station chief,
and I'm the intelligence operative.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.460
So of course you outrank me—

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.990
you're the one managing me.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.630
But to ensure smooth operations

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.690
and your personal safety,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.750
every decision you make

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.250
must be approved
by the intelligence operative.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.750
And every recommendation
from the intelligence operative

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.430
must be adopted
and acted upon by the chief.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.320
Why not just say

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.750
you want to be the one in charge?

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.250
Let's not put it that way.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.960
You're the chief—

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.380
you're naturally the boss.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.370
It's just that while you're the manager,

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.510
you'll voluntarily

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.130
cede all decision-making to me.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.860
So, these 3 points—deal or not?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.820
Deal.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.190
Really?

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.170
Yes.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.490
It's official.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.870
could you help Yinwan
tidy up a bit more?

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.310
I'm heading to the tailor's

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.050
to pick up the curtains
and bedsheets we ordered.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.020
Thank you, Mrs. He.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.110
Don't mention it.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.990
Ms. Qiao,

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.380
the general affairs office
has prepared

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.190
some daily supplies for you.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.980
I'll go get them for you.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.930
Alright, thank you, Yu.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.730
Xian, you've really gone
to so much trouble for us this time.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.840
No trouble at all.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.660
Where should I put these books?

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.700
Just on that table, please.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.370
Alright.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.570
This photo album
must be really precious to you.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.190
How could you tell?

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.990
On the night we escaped Hong Kong,

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.640
your luggage was jostled away
in the crowd,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.110
but you desperately tried

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.170
to protect this album no matter what.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.200
I thought then

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.820
that the photos inside

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.620
must be really important to you.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.090
Would you like to see them?

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:05.840
This is you,

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.700
and this is your brother.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.460
Who else?

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.220
You two looked quite
alike as children.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.010
Mm-hmm.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.130
My parents passed away

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.450
before I could even remember anything.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:22.670
So it was my brother

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.810
who took me along,
wandering everywhere.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.070
When I was 7,

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.010
both my brother and I

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.470
were taken in
by the Benevolence Orphanage.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.700
Look at this photo—

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.159
can you tell our eyes are still swollen?

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.340
Right before it was taken,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.960
we'd just finished
crying our eyes out.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.990
Why?

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.810
I remember it was Christmas Day.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.720
It was my first time
seeing the priest and Madam,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.720
and I was so scared

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.630
that I hid inside a concealed wall.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.720
A concealed wall?

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.050
Like the ones

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.810
people built in the old days

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.940
to guard against bandits and thieves.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.080
A concealed wall.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.750
Oh, I know—

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.450
the kind wealthy families

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.190
would build in their big houses,

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.490
so people could hide inside

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:01.880
if there was danger.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.550
But those concealed walls a

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:04.840
re usually very discreet;

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.460
someone could live in a house

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.130
for years
without even knowing it existed.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.260
How did you find it?

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.390
That concealed wall

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.460
was built behind a statue
of the Virgin Mary,

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.750
and the switch was actually
one of her shoes.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.050
I stumbled into it completely
by accident—

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.990
somehow, I just crawled in.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:20.940
I remember that day—

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.580
the entire orphanage
was turned upside down

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.220
searching for me for half the day.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.260
When they couldn't find me,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.790
everyone went to sing hymns
and eat apple pie—

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.120
only my brother kept looking.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.120
He must have been exhausted

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.200
because he actually crouched
by the wall and started crying.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.270
And that's when he heard me

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.460
singing "Moonlight shines"
from inside the wall.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.320
You felt like singing at a time like that?

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.840
You have no idea how dark
it was inside that concealed wall—

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.120
not a single glimmer of light.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.170
Of course I had to sing

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.370
to keep my courage up.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.250
Then what happened?

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.790
Then

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.810
the priest took this photo

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:01.930
for us afterward.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.200
And the Madam made us apple pie again,

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.220
but my brother didn't eat a single bite—

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.360
he let me have it all.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.980
Who would've thought?

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.360
Your brother

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.260
was really good to you.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.430
Yeah.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.450
Even though my parents
were gone so early,

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.820
as long as I have my brother,

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:27.980
I've always felt like I have a home.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.740
But

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.580
these last two years,

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.620
we've been arguing a lot.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.290
Why is that?

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.390
It's always

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.900
about charity gala for the Resistance.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.580
My brother's afraid the Japanese
might retaliate against me,

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.040
so he doesn't want me to go.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.820
I think he's being cowardly,

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.960
not manly enough.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.120
We've fought over this

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.700
countless times.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.230
You're his closest family—

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.460
it's only natural
he doesn't want you taking risks.

[Participated in a school event
with Renyu at age seven.]

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.670
I wonder how my brother is doing,

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.110
whether he's suffering.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:22.680
I'm really worried—

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.670
with his temperament,

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.800
I don't know if he can hold up
if he's fallen into Japanese hands.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.320

Yes,

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.570

General Yazaki,

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.790
according to Hong Kong dollar
issuance regulations,

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:40.700
before issuing new banknotes,
all banks

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.390
must hold reserve funds
in pounds sterling—

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.810
at the fixed exchange rate

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.740
of £1 to HK$16—

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.900
equivalent to the value

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.460
of those notes.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.360
This batch of unsigned banknotes

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.790
exceeds 100 million in value,

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.840
yet there are no equivalent reserves

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.270
to secure the currency's worth.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.030
If issued into circulation,

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.570
they would completely destroy
confidence in the Hong Kong dollar

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.460
and could even

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.950
trigger a severe financial crisis

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:15.070
in regions that use it.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.980
As banking managers,

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.120
we simply cannot carry out something

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.480
that violates professional ethics
so fundamentally.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.700

Our inventory doesn't hold

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.370
that much gold in reserve.

In that case,

With all the fanfare
surrounding your opening,

I thought Macau's banking scene

had gained a formidable new player.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.700
That's why I came eagerly
seeking cooperation.

But now it seems
Tai Fung Bank's capabilities

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.060
are rather limited.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.760
In that case,
Specie Bank won't press further.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.820
Consider this visit never happened.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:14.830
Let's go.

It's just a pity that so many
business peers and ordinary depositors,

I truly can't understand their decision—

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.610
I'm genuinely concerned for them.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.630
Who says Tai Fung Bank lacks capability?

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.240
Mr. Liang.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:41.840
Mr. Liang.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.890
Mr. He,

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:47.320
I have a transaction
I'd like to entrust to Tai Fung Bank.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.710
What transaction would that be?

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:51.370
Here are 2.5 million

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.830
in Chinese Customs Gold Units.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.490
I'd like to exchange them
for Hong Kong dollars.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.890
No problem, we'll handle that
for you right away.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.820
Would you prefer cash or a deposit?

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:01.780
Deposit.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.980
I trust Tai Fung Bank's

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.670
reputation completely—

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.580
just deposit it into my account.

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:07.330
Very well.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:08.930
Then I'll accept the funds.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:09.630
Excellent.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.850

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:11.590
Xian.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.590
Mr. Ogata,

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.670
you just said

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.800
any currency directly pegged to gold

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.670
at equivalent value would be acceptable.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.370
The Chinese National
Government's Customs Gold Units

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.900
are directly linked
to gold units in customs.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.570
That should meet
your requirement, correct?

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.950

We currently have 2.5 million

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.870
enough to convert
over 13 million Hong Kong dollars.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.760
We accept Specie Bank's

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.690

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:05.500
Mr. Rodrigues,

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.220
I heard you have
a significant stock of rubber.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.590
Now that I have the funds,

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.930
I'd like to discuss the business.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:11.430
Sure.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.610
Where would you prefer to talk?

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:13.940
No need to go elsewhere.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.960
Our bank has a private lounge,

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:16.830
which is relatively quiet.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.130
Allow me to show you both there.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:18.720
Good.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.350
I'd feel most comfortable
conducting business at Tai Fung Bank.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.960
Please.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:22.930
This way.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:23.530
All right.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:36.690
Chief,

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.180
we've investigated He Xian.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.740
He's merely a minor shareholder
in Tai Fung Bank,

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.670
and his position is just manager—

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.400
nothing suspicious about him.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.280
But he was the one

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.870
who handled that grain deal last time,

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.830
and it ended up
causing us serious trouble.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:52.890
Now

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.700
he's mixed up with people
like Ma Wanqi.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:56.780
This guy

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.080
might not be as simple
as he seems, don't you think?

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:01.980
Wasn't the last incident

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.000
already thoroughly investigated?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.240
He was cleared.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.520
Back in Hong Kong, he ran a bank—

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.020
now he's just returning to his old trade

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.630
to make a living.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.800
He's certainly not working
against the Imperial Army.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.170
Right now,

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.570
I don't have time
to worry about a minor manager.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.500
Since you vouch for him,

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.280
just focus your surveillance

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.130
on Liang Yanming and Rodrigues for now.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.170
Report back immediately

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:28.740
if anything's up.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.330
Yes, sir.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.560
Is there truly no more available?

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.170
With a war going on, everyone
in the world is scrambling for rubber.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.890
The biggest rubber-producing region,
Southeast Asia,

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.590
was just seized by the Japanese—

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.150
supplies are completely cut off.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:46.260
This is honestly all the stock I have.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.630
But word on the street is

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.910
that you bought up the huge stockpile

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.480
of Lee Kong Chian,
the Rubber King of Southeast Asia.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.140
If only I had managed to buy it.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.430
I've been pleading
with Lee Kong Chian for years,

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.540
hoping to secure the rights
to distribute his rubber.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.800
But he's the famous Rubber King—

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:01.130
he never had any interest

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.330
in a small-time Macau merchant like me.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:06.760
It was't until the Japanese suddenly
attacked Southeast Asia

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.020
that he got desperate.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.130
He said whoever could send ships
before the Japanese arrived

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:12.530
would get his stockpile.

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:15.000
The moment I got the message,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.690
I sent my fleet over.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.090
But it was still too late.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.460
What happened
to Lee Kong Chian's stock then?

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.190
Before the Japanese takeover,

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.930
it was secretly shipped

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.240
to Hawaii by U.S. warships
from the Philippines.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.500
That's confidential.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.830
If he hadn't needed
to tell me to recall my fleet,

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.850
Lee Kong Chian wouldn't
have even informed me.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.670
On the very day my fleet turned back,

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:36.870
the Japanese arrived.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:37.670
They're still

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:39.870
searching everywhere for that rubber.

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.000

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:33.610
some people are inevitably eager
to offload.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:34.800
Once stability returns to the market,

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.860
it should rebound.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:37.130
Mm-Hmm,

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.410
we'll just have to keep observing

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:40.540
and adapt as needed.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:46.370
We only sold off 2 million HKD today,

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.150
Mr. Ogata.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.030
At this rate,

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.700
how long will it take

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.230
to offload the 120 million?

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:04.250
Macau's circulating currency
is the Hong Kong dollar,

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:08.870
and those Chinese merchants don't hold
large amounts of National Currency.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:13.650
They need time to raise funds.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.020
Colonel, the intricacies
of market manipulation

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.960
are beyond the grasp

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.480
of an intelligence officer like yourself.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.190
Slowly boiling these Chinese frogs alive

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.980
is my specialty,

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.230
so you needn't trouble yourself.

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.180
[HKD: 3.55]

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:41.020
[HKD: 2.98]

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:48.800
Even with our Tai Fung Bank alone

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.170
having taken in
over 5 million Hong Kong dollars,

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:52.540
how can things still be like this?

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.390
Most likely, it's because

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.000
too much capital has fled Hong Kong
for Macau.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.020
People are still shaken

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.480
after the recent blockade,

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.850
and with the Japanese
plundering resources in Hong Kong,

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:03.090
businesses have been

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:05.700
buying frantically at any cost
these past few days.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.760
That's the biggest shock to the market.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.190
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.980
I looked into it—

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.830
all the Hong Kong dollars
issued on the market before

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:12.610
were printed

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.250
before 1937.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.440
But the ones we've been receiving lately

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.750
were all printed after 1937.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.240
Not only are they newly printed,

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.860
but there are also
many more 500-dollar notes in circulation.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.460
We've verified repeatedly—

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.070
these Hong Kong dollars
are not counterfeit.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:29.950
Hong Kong had previously released

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.520
sample designs for 500-dollar notes.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.720
They were within the planned issuance.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:36.370
These notes bear

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:39.240
the signatures of the HSBC
chief manager and chief accountant.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.300
HSBC's reputation

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.200
wouldn't allow for recklessness.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.690
That may be true in principle,

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.090
but since Hong Kong fell,

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:47.190
HSBC has been effectively
in Japanese hands.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.930
If there's any trickery involved,

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.280
it's a risk we simply can't control.

00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.890
Hello.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:00.650
Mr. Liang.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:02.260
What?

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.780
Because the Hong Kong dollar
has fallen too sharply,

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:09.380
Rodrigues is unwilling to honor
the original contract anymore.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.040
Liang Yanming and
the people from Tai Fung Bank

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.430
went to Rodrigues' company.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:14.930
I don't know what was said there,

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:15.960
but when they came out,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.130
my men reported

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:18.860
that they all looked dejected.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:21.720
Okay.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:28.460
See?

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.090
Just as I said—

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.910
as long as we keep driving
down the Hong Kong dollar,

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.440
Liang Yanming's business
will fall through.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:36.540
But

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.950
so far, after selling
just over 20 million,

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:42.500
we've already pushed
the Hong Kong dollar below 3.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:43.560
And these past few days,

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.060
those Chinese merchants
have clearly grown more cautious,

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.990
increasingly unwilling to buy in.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.760
Even if we disrupt Liang Yanming's deal,

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.860
as long as the Chinese banks
retain some strength,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.000
we won't have full control
over Macau's finances.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.760
That's why

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:02.210
I plan to use
Liang Yanming's stalled business

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:05.190
to provoke those Chinese merchants again,

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.610
to squeeze every last drop from them.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:13.850
Do you have a way

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:17.560
to make them keep buying?

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.130

how to boil frogs slowly, do you?

Don't worry—

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.960
when the heat rises enough

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.240
for them to feel the pain,

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.760
I'll have the anesthetic ready.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.800
Only then will I turn up the fire

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.410

The situation is clear to everyone now.

When Mr. Liang placed the order

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.960
for these wartime supplies
with Rodrigues,

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.000
the Hong Kong dollar was still
at 3.8 against the National Currency.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.270
But in just a few short days,

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:13.770
it has fallen below 3.

Rodrigues was relatively reasonable.

However, his final condition is

that today's closing price
of the Hong Kong dollar

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.600
over 16 million Hong Kong dollars.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.830
Yet at the current rate of decline,

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.000
even with the combined strength
of our 4 banks,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.860
we may not be able to hold the line.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:20.140
And we have no idea

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.390
how much selling pressure
there is in the market.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.920
Fighting blindly like this

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.640
carries far too great a risk.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:27.350
Xian, gentlemen,

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:31.500
HSBC has just made an announcement
regarding the Hong Kong dollar.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.970
[New HKD notes are safe
to accept and use.]

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:38.770
The escaped British treasurer
is named Robert.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:39.810
He was shot

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:44.290
and fell into the waters off Hong Kong's
Causeway Bay late last night.

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:45.590
The Hong Kong garrison

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:49.100
detained all vessels
and personnel in the area.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.100
The search continued until this morning,

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.160
but his whereabouts remain unknown.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:57.810
That doesn't necessarily mean
he fled to Macau, though.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.040
Causeway Bay is known
for the highest number

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:03.350
of smuggling boats traveling
between Hong Kong and Macau.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:07.810
It's possible a few slipped through.

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.390
General's orders are clear—
this man holds

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:13.910
the entire truth about the forced signing
of the Hong Kong dollars.

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:15.710
We must act with utmost caution.

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:16.910
Inform Huang Gongjie

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.160
to immediately launch
a comprehensive search

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.360
of all docks and coastal areas in Macau.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.000
Yes, sir.

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:26.250
Listen—

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:32.850
dead or alive,
we need to find him.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:35.220
Under no circumstances

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:39.730
can Robert be allowed
to leak any information.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:40.890
Yes, sir!

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.500
[East Asia Hotel]

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.770
Hurry up, hurry.

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:09.270
What do you think?

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:11.870
I'm just worried—

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:13.350
we stopped buying,

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:15.080
and just then the news came out.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.620
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:17.960
Something doesn't feel
right to me either.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.850
What if this batch of Hong Kong dollars
amounts to more than 10 million?

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.850
Are you suggesting HSBC
released false information?

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.680
That can't be, right?

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:27.230
With HSBC's reputation,

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:28.080
plus the confirmation from Mr. Grayburn

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.060
and Mr. Qiao…

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.020
Given their stature,

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.790
would they truly disregard
all professional ethics

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:35.450
and tell such an enormous lie?

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:38.050
But they are, after all,
in Japanese hands now.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:39.520
The press conference

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.430
was also held jointly
with the Japanese.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.770
The Japanese
are capable of anything.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.380
You two, keep searching,

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:53.890
keep at it.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:55.060
Mr. Huang.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.920
How much for this wine?

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:12.100
This wine…

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.270

there are no major sell orders.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.600
Just as expected.

Xian, Wan Qi,

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.910
you can finally set your minds
at ease now, right?

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:37.950
I propose

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:40.850
that this afternoon,
all four of us join forces

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:43.310
to prop up the market
and push the Hong Kong dollar above 3.4.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:45.230
-I agree.
-I agree.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.450
-Agreed.
-Agreed.

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:50.350
Xian,

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.000
this afternoon's battle

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.770
isn't just about

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:53.790
recouping our

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:55.540
massive losses—

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.960
it also has a direct bearing
on Mr. Liang's contract

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.620
and the overall Resistance effort
at the front.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.790
Mr. He, do you still have any concerns?

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:11.600
If that's the case,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.960
I'll personally monitor
the exchange this afternoon.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:18.020
That way, if anything changes,
we can adapt on the spot.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.350
Good, that puts me
even more at ease.

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:28.410
Chang, I saw you from across the way.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:29.950
What's up?

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.420
Come and see for yourself.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.330
Alright.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.270
I'm heading out for a bit.

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:37.600
I'll be back
before the afternoon session opens.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.270
Where to?

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.280
Kiang Wu Elementary School.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.390
Yinwan reads the Xiangdao Daily
every day.

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:43.210
If she finds out

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:44.960
her brother is collaborating
with the Japanese…

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.680
I understand.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.830
Go quickly and come back soon.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:47.480
Alright.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.410
Here you go.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:55.980
Did you just find him?

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.870
Stop joking. The smuggling sampans
from Hong Kong

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.370
often deliver goods for the gang.

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:01.850
Late last night, this one
set out from Causeway Bay,

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:02.560
and it was almost to Macau

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.540
when they found this foreigner
in the cabin.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:05.870
No idea who he is—

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:06.940
all they know is that last night,

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.960
the Japanese were causing
a huge commotion in Causeway Bay,

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.060
detaining hundreds of boats,

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:12.730
probably all for him.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.430
Huang Gongjie's men
are also out in full force,

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:16.490
searching for him.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.270
This man isn't ordinary.

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:19.270
Take a look.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:20.370
He's seriously injured,

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:21.410
shot twice.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.050
He keeps mumbling incoherently

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:23.930
in a foreign language.

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:25.500
You're the only one
who can understand him.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:26.870
What's your name?

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:28.160
Who are you?

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:31.330
HSBC Hong Kong...

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.620
Yea, that was what he kept saying.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.620
What does it mean?

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.500
Oh, okay, okay.

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.250
What does it mean?

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:41.390
He said HSBC and the Hong Kong dollar.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:44.460
Since the Japanese
are making such a fuss over him,

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.460
this person must be very important.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.400
Master Huang,

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.290
please take him

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:49.560
to Dr. Ke right away.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.560
I'll go find Xian.

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:52.760
No one understands HSBC

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.950
and the Hong Kong dollar better than Xian.

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:56.680
Alright, I'll find a rickshaw.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:57.660
Okay.

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:07.330
Don't run so fast.

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:12.750
Xian.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:14.400
Goodbye, Miss Qiao.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.490
Goodbye. Wei,
you can go now.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:17.640
Yinwan.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:18.450
Class is over?

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:19.250
Class is over.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:20.930
Did you come to see me?

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:22.330
Is something the matter?

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:23.710
It's nothing.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:24.330
I was just passing by

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:25.660
and thought I'd drop in.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.360
Come on in and have a seat.

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.890
How come the school janitor
didn't deliver the newspaper today?

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:34.160
Probably too busy.

00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:35.560
Xian, have a seat.

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.890
I'll get you some water.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:42.100
Hurry up, hurry up.

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:42.830
Hurry up!

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.620
Make way, make way.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.710
Chief,

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:54.080
I just heard from the rickshaw drivers
over there

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.980
that someone carried a person
wrapped tightly in blankets

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:56.940
onto a rickshaw—

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:58.960
there was blood on the blanket.

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:00.350
Where did they go?

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:01.250
Headed west.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:03.840
After them.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:04.290
Yes, sir.
