WEBVTT

00:00:00.065 --> 00:00:25.953


00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:35.953
BEYOND THE BAR

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.403
{\an8}What are you doing?

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.158
{\an8}What's with this woman?

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.535
{\an8}Who is she?

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:46.249
{\an8}Stop it.

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.460
Who the hell is this nutjob?

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:50.212
Let's go.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:51.963
Wait. Let me call the cops.

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:53.840
Let's just go. Okay?

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.667
If it's too hard to talk about it now,
we can wait--

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.421
I broke up with someone I loved.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:37.008
We were together for eight months,

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:41.388
and it's been three months
since the breakup.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:42.848
I see.

00:03:43.974 --> 00:03:46.059
He already has a new girlfriend.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.562
I loved him a lot.

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:50.647
So…

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:53.900
it's been really hard on me.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:55.694
Right.

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:03.535
I want to sue my ex-boyfriend.

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:07.539
I get that you're upset about the breakup,

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:11.918
but you can't press criminal
or civil charges without legal grounds.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:16.256
I'm sorry you're hurting from the breakup,

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.468
but the damage isn't
something the law can compensate for,

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:22.137
so I'm afraid there's nothing
I can help you with.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:42.657
My ex-boyfriend did this to me.

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:43.658
Pardon?

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:52.584
I want to sue him.

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:05.847
LOVE IS AN IMPAIRMENT

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.280
Be extra careful
not to irritate the wound.

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:26.034
You have keloid-prone skin,

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:29.204
so whenever you get injured,
the scars tend to rise up

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.540
and spread beyond the original wound.

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.418
You have sensitive skin
that reacts even to small wounds.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:43.134
With normal skin, this would have healed
without leaving a scar.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:47.055
But because your skin
forms aggressive keloids,

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:49.140
it left noticeable scars like this.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:54.104
Will the scars go away if I get treatment?

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.857
Keloid scars are
very difficult to get rid of.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:06:00.277
This injection is
the only way to help reduce it.

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:02.612
If I treated it surgically--

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.781
No, that will make it worse.

00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:08.368
Because the surgical scars
will likely form keloids too.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.248
Is there no other way?

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:15.542
I work as a model,

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:18.003
but I can't model anymore
because of these scars.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.172
Gosh…

00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:35.562
Since time is money for everyone here,

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.355
I'll keep this short.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.442
I've gathered you
for an important announcement.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.319
As of today, I'll be retired

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.279
but staying on as an advisor.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.198
What's going on here?

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.409
Now, I'd like to introduce my successor,

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:53.830
our new managing partner.

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.957
Ms. Kwon Na-yeon.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.293
Please step up.

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.253
The attorney whose name
is a brand in itself?

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:10.055
Kwon Na-yeon?

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:11.139
I've never seen her.

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:13.725
She was assigned
to DA Solutions, remember?

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:14.935
DA Solutions?

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:17.187
It's a tiny company
out in the middle of nowhere.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.357
Assigned? She just got sidelined
because of office politics.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.776
What a triumphant return.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.696
The inauguration
and my retirement ceremony

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.115
will be held tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.621
This will be a historic moment.
The first time a major Korean law firm

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:39.209
will be led by a woman in her forties
who is not a graduate of SNU Law.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:42.629
Your presence at this historic moment

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.506
would be greatly appreciated.

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:45.966
Thank you.

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:50.720
Hey, it's the rainmaker.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.389
Hey, watch what you say.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.395
YULLIM APPOINTS FIRST FEMALE
MANAGING PARTNER IN HER FORTIES

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:01.940
Mr. Ko!

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:03.692
You didn't even consult me on this.

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:04.651
Take a seat.

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.277
Why Kwon Na-yeon…

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:07.654
What on earth are you thinking?

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.240
Don't get worked up. Sit.

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.866
Are you really retiring?

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.535
Why not stay for about five more years

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:14.828
and hand me the baton--

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.705
- Hand you the baton?
- I…

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.623
And if I do,

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.458
will anyone follow you?

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:21.418
Sorry?

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.006
A law firm isn't like a corporation.

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:29.509
You can't just transfer
management rights like that.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.678
A law firm is a partnership.

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:35.515
Which one of the partners here
would follow you like they follow me?

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.767
But… Father.

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:41.771
Besides, why would you want to be
the captain of a sinking ship anyway?

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:44.733
I asked you to warn
Yoon Seok-hoon to stay in line.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.860
How could you side with him?

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:49.821
You brought back his mentor
who we worked so hard to get rid of--

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.573
The world has changed.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:55.285
It's time law firms competed
based on expertise.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.413
How long are we going to let
those dinosaurs keep getting cases

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:01.124
through personal ties
instead of actual skill?

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.792
Can you get your hands dirty?

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:03.960
Can you do that?

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.426
You see,

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.887
we watch from behind, hands folded,

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.598
while those hatchet men
swing their swords.

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:19.559
And when the chaos dies down,
we chop their heads off

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.687
and gracefully step
onto the newly arranged playing field

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.898
and just keep doing what we've been doing.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.024
Sorry?

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.901
They're just

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:29.986
our tools.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.945
Just hatchet men.

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.281
But…

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:35.325
They…

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:38.495
Kwon Na-yeon and Yoon Seok-hoon
are not people we can mess with.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.954
They're not.

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:41.623
That's why I gave them the swords.

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:42.582
Then

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.877
how will you chop their heads off
once they're done?

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:50.548
Who do you think they'll target first?

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:52.926
Those overpaid
former judges and prosecutors

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.261
and advisors who can't land any clients.

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:59.474
Who would follow a hatchet man
who swung their sword at them?

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:02.727
What's a law firm again?

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:06.314
- Part…
- Yes, partnership.

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.400
A leader who hasn't earned
the respect of the partners

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:11.402
can never truly lead.

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:15.573
Sadist?

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.201
So?

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:20.912
As it turns out, Ms. Seol Eun-yeong

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.957
has keloid-prone skin,
which reacts severely to injuries.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.127
What wouldn't leave a mark
on someone with normal skin,

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.337
such as sexual activity,

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.048
left keloidal scarring in Ms. Seol's case,
which gradually spread

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:34.259
and has now become quite unsightly.

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:36.177
On top of everything,

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.638
she's a model.

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:42.183
That's rough.

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:43.226
But

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:46.354
if the client did not consent
to the sadistic act,

00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:48.273
it could constitute assault.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.274
That's right.

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.900
I actually asked her that.

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:53.778
She said he made her sign
a consent form before sex,

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:55.864
like some kind of ritual.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:57.448
How thorough.

00:10:58.032 --> 00:10:58.992
How about alcohol?

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:01.077
If she was intoxicated at the time
she gave consent,

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:03.663
we could argue she lacked capacity,
so the consent wouldn't hold.

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:05.415
I asked her that too,

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.376
but she can't drink at all,
so that never happened.

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:09.711
This is difficult.

00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:12.797
To establish assault,

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:16.342
we'd have to argue
that the consent was not valid.

00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:19.846
Why is that?

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.766
What does the validity of consent
have to do with assault?

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.768
Jeez, you scared me.

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:29.147
If I were to flick
your forehead right now,

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.106
would that be assault?

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.649
Of course.

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:35.195
Then what if we both agreed
to a forehead flick if we lost a game?

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:36.905
- That's not assault.
- Why not?

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:40.533
I don't know.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:43.328
What about boxing?
They hit each other. Isn't that assault?

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.079
That's not assault.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:46.372
Why not?

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.416
Because it's a sport.

00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:51.502
In principle, the act itself
constitutes assault,

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.922
but because the other party consented,

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.840
it doesn't amount to a crime.

00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:00.303
Say you were a victim of school violence

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:03.139
and only agreed to the forehead flick game

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:06.476
out of fear of retaliation.
Would that consent still be valid?

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.229
That's not genuine consent,
so it's assault.

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.313
Exactly.

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.565
For consent to negate
the unlawfulness of the act,

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:15.944
it must be given by the victim
while in a state capable of making

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:16.945
a voluntary decision.

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.947
A straightforward example would be

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.699
someone signing a contract
while under the influence of drugs,

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:25.328
under hypnosis,
or with a knife pointed at them.

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:28.790
That can't be considered
genuine consent, so--

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:31.501
It can't be regarded
as a valid expression of consent.

00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:34.003
So that's why it constitutes assault.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:34.963
Exactly.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.758
There was written consent,

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:41.219
but there may be room
to argue one key point…

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:44.973
- Which is?
- Ms. Seol was in love.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:48.893
Therefore, she was in a state
of diminished capacity.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.436
What?

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.648
Can't we say love is
a form of diminished capacity too?

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.403
You never disappoint.

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.405
How creative. Good job, Hyo-min.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:03.491
That's the funniest thing
I've heard recently.

00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:05.243
Hear me out.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.745
When we fall in love,
we all lose a bit of judgment

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:08.913
and become irrational.

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:11.082
You've all been in love, right?

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:14.002
Let's say you're at the beach in winter,

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:17.130
and the woman you love says,
"If you love me, jump in."

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:20.133
Jumping into the sea
in the middle of a freezing winter…

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.802
There's nothing rational
or normal about that, is there?

00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:27.098
Come to think of it,

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:30.143
my high school girlfriend
was kind of a perv.

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.645
One time she was chewing
this super juicy gum,

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:35.523
and then she spat out her saliva
into a cup and said,

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:37.900
"Drink it

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:40.111
if you want to date me."

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:42.322
- So I…
- So you what?

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.032
I drank it.

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:45.241
Jeez.

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:47.285
It makes me sick now,

00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:49.120
but back then,

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:52.623
I was able do it because I was in love.

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:55.460
Love can impair your mind
and body to the point

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:57.920
where rational judgment
becomes impossible.

00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:01.007
So if the consent was given
under diminished capacity,

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.300
it's not legally valid,

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:04.677
and that makes it assault.

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:07.221
Your argument doesn't make any sense,

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:09.724
but it kind of makes sense
at the same time.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.233
No way.

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:23.112
Are you seriously thinking
of going with this absurd argument?

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:25.031
Since an assault charge requires

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:27.742
grounds to invalidate the consent,

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:31.496
we have no choice but to consider
Ms. Kang's argument more thoroughly.

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:33.915
Why not just drop the case?

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:36.334
We're drowning in work
because the whole universe knows

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:37.960
how good you are.

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:40.546
Is it really necessary
to take on a case like this?

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.048
It's intriguing.

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:45.676
Why do you think the Anglo-American
legal system is so developed?

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.719
I'm not sure.

00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:50.556
They file lawsuits
for tripping over a rock

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.352
or for getting cancer
after years of chain smoking.

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:56.187
That gives courts

00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:01.150
a chance to think through legal principles
more creatively and in broader contexts.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:04.987
Over time, precedents build up,
reducing legal uncertainty.

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:09.367
As a result, legal predictability
and trust in court rulings increase.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.078
People come to rely on the law

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:14.956
rather than keeping their problems

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:16.666
to themselves.

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:19.293
That's the start of a virtuous cycle.

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:20.920
I see.

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:23.548
I think it's worth trying too.

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:27.093
Genuine consent must be voluntary.

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:29.387
If consent was given
under psychological pressure,

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.097
then it can't be considered legally valid.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:35.268
We can probably look into whether
she felt pressured when she agreed.

00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:38.980
There was a case in the US in which
a woman claimed to have been raped,

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:44.485
arguing that her consent
to a seemingly consensual sexual encounter

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:47.321
was the result of psychological
and economic pressure.

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:49.907
Let's work on this case.

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:50.908
Okay, Mr. Yoon.

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:04.672
Yes.

00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:05.798
Come in.

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:08.301
This is our new client
in the divorce case…

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:09.343
What are you doing here?

00:16:11.762 --> 00:16:13.181
Do you two know each other?

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:14.474
It's been a while.

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:17.518
I said, what are you doing here?

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:20.688
What's going on?

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:26.402
I'm sorry, but would you
mind giving us a moment?

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:32.033
Sure.

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.368
I can do that.

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:46.547
I almost didn't recognize you.

00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:48.841
Had we bumped
into each other on the street,

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:51.469
- I would have walked right past you.
- Cut to the chase.

00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:54.263
I'm divorcing him.

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:55.431
And?

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:56.766
I'll probably sue him.

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:57.892
And?

00:16:58.976 --> 00:17:00.394
Please take my case.

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:01.479
Seriously?

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.898
- Min-jeong--
- Don't "Min-jeong" me.

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.570
You're the perfect person
for this case, Ms. Heo.

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.114
I saw people praising you

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:15.117
as the top divorce attorney
on a support forum for moms,

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:16.911
so I checked your profile.

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:20.289
But at the time,
I never imagined it would be you.

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:24.669
I was going to let it go
when I found out it was you.

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:26.379
But then I thought

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.549
you'd understand me better than anyone--

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:32.510
How would I understand
what it's like to be a mistress?

00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:34.804
You were wronged by his family

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:36.514
and by him.

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.183
The same thing happened to me.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.729
You reap what you sow.
Justice has prevailed.

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:50.444
Don't ever come here again.

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:54.115
Don't go dragging someone through the mud

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:56.784
when they've wiped their past clean.

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:38.492
That was nice.

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:43.164
Heavens. Just look at her.

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:46.208
No wonder she's getting fat.

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:47.168
You!

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:49.962
We'll go broke at this rate. Stop eating!

00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:52.381
- At this hour?
- Yes, Mother.

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:54.800
It reeks of food in here.

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:56.677
Gosh, I'm getting a headache.

00:18:56.761 --> 00:19:01.849
No wonder my son is never home!
It's all because of you!

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:05.436
My poor son.

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:09.148
I don't know how he ended up
getting involved with someone like you.

00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:11.525
You got pregnant without a plan

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:16.030
and used that as an excuse
to tie my son down!

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:17.365
And now…

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.583
APPLICATION FOR CONFIRMATION
OF AGREEMENT TO DIVORCE

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.001
{\an8}CHOI DAE-WON
HEO MIN-JEONG

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:30.836
Sign it.

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:35.633
Whatever.

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:38.594
She's moving in.

00:19:40.054 --> 00:19:41.514
Stay if that's what you want.

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:46.727
I'll do better.

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:50.356
Let's not do this.

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:54.276
For So-hyeon's sake,
let's forget about this.

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:57.279
Don't use me as your excuse.
Just get a divorce!

00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:00.991
That's what I want,
and that's what's best for me.

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.300
Ms. Heo.

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:22.930
Min-jeong.

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:24.724
Yes?

00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:26.684
What's on your mind? Didn't you hear me?

00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:28.644
It's nothing. What is it?

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:32.398
They want us in the conference room.
It's Ms. Kwon Na-yeon's inauguration.

00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:34.191
Right. Let's go.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:37.987
Hurry.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.197
INAUGURATION OF
MANAGING PARTNER KWON NA-YEON

00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:41.657
Yullim is lost

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:44.869
and adrift at the moment.

00:20:46.412 --> 00:20:47.747
But it is okay.

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:51.292
The great writer Goethe once said,

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:55.921
"Man errs so long as he strives."

00:20:57.339 --> 00:20:58.549
To err means

00:20:58.632 --> 00:21:00.509
you have a goal.

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:04.388
It's proof that there is a point
you're trying to reach.

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:06.724
An organization that no longer struggles

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:09.769
and settles into complacency
and stagnation

00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:14.231
is as good as dead.

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.485
Our goal is clear.

00:21:18.402 --> 00:21:20.446
A law firm that earns trust with expertise

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:23.157
and wins through excellence.

00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:25.326
It's time for Yullim

00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:27.244
to pursue sustainable growth

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:30.706
through professional expertise.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.292
We must choose competence over indulgence

00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:35.336
and expertise

00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:37.046
over connections.

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:42.843
This is the path that Yullim must follow.

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:46.514
Let us move forward together

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:49.809
towards Yullim's new future!

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.742
Let me know if you need anything.

00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:07.701
I will.

00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:10.621
It's been a while.

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:13.499
I really enjoyed your speech.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.376
Did you?

00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:18.671
The comment about indulgence
and connections

00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:20.297
wasn't directed at you, Mr. Ko.

00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:22.383
I know that.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:23.926
Tell me.

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:26.345
What does it feel like to return in glory?

00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:29.807
Thanks to you,
I had some truly amazing experiences.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.016
Wasn't it over too soon?

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.935
I wish you'd stayed there
a few more years.

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:35.896
It's only right that such a position
should go to you, Mr. Ko.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.022
I'm good here.

00:22:37.648 --> 00:22:39.567
I've learned a lot thanks to you.

00:22:40.401 --> 00:22:42.361
I'll make sure to pay you back.

00:22:42.444 --> 00:22:43.487
You will?

00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:44.947
I look forward to that.

00:22:50.327 --> 00:22:51.871
You're a professional, aren't you?

00:22:51.954 --> 00:22:54.915
Are you not aware of who your client is?

00:22:54.999 --> 00:22:56.959
Your client, Ms. Kwon,

00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:59.295
is Hynic Core Inc.,

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:02.298
not its CEO, Lee Seong-bin.

00:23:03.132 --> 00:23:07.344
Of course, a company's CEO
may identify themselves with the company.

00:23:07.428 --> 00:23:09.597
That is, when one
does not have legal knowledge.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.140
How could a lawyer

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:12.933
possibly be unaware

00:23:13.017 --> 00:23:16.103
that a company and its representative

00:23:16.186 --> 00:23:17.396
are legally separate entities?

00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:18.898
I am aware.

00:23:19.523 --> 00:23:22.735
But if CEO Lee Seong-bin goes down,
so does Hynic Core.

00:23:22.818 --> 00:23:25.029
Who are you to make that judgment call?

00:23:25.738 --> 00:23:26.780
Mr. Ko.

00:23:27.531 --> 00:23:31.035
Tell me.
Do you really need to take it this far?

00:23:31.118 --> 00:23:32.995
This is embezzlement in a technical sense,

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:35.706
but it's not like Mr. Lee
actually stole any money.

00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:37.166
With the right legal advice--

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:40.920
We're saying such legal advice
is a conflict of interest.

00:23:41.003 --> 00:23:43.964
If you're so eager
to personally represent Lee Seong-bin,

00:23:44.048 --> 00:23:47.009
then leave Yullim,
open your own office in Seocho-dong,

00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:48.052
and go ahead.

00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:49.470
No one is stopping you.

00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:52.181
These days, even lawyers in Seocho-dong

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:54.767
{\an8}are setting up joint offices
with separate-account systems…

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.394
{\an8}SEPARATE-ACCOUNT SYSTEMS
EACH ATTORNEY HANDLES THEIR OWN FINANCES

00:23:57.478 --> 00:23:58.938
…and calling them law firms.

00:23:59.021 --> 00:24:01.982
Why don't you go join them?
She'd fit right in, wouldn't she?

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:07.905
They brought down

00:24:07.988 --> 00:24:10.032
an entire company just to force me out.

00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:13.160
They're capable of anything.

00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:16.497
- Yes.
- An eye for an eye, right?

00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:18.040
Right.

00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:21.126
They'll make the first move.

00:24:21.752 --> 00:24:24.129
The priority is keeping Yullim alive.

00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:27.174
Let's start with the restructuring.

00:24:27.257 --> 00:24:28.217
Definitely.

00:24:32.429 --> 00:24:33.597
Diminished capacity?

00:24:34.264 --> 00:24:35.140
Yes.

00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:38.185
Can love also constitute
diminished capacity?

00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:43.357
The only argument we can make
is that the consent wasn't valid,

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.442
which means you'd have to claim

00:24:45.526 --> 00:24:48.570
you weren't
mentally competent at the time.

00:24:49.738 --> 00:24:50.739
I see.

00:24:50.823 --> 00:24:53.117
So we have a few questions to ask.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.576
Sure.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.621
Do you have masochistic tendencies?

00:24:57.705 --> 00:24:58.914
Masochistic?

00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:01.542
What is that?

00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:03.210
A masochist

00:25:03.752 --> 00:25:07.423
is someone who gets sexually aroused
by pain or being abused--

00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:08.590
No.

00:25:09.091 --> 00:25:10.384
Not at all.

00:25:10.467 --> 00:25:12.928
Are there people who like that?

00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:17.891
Then why did you give consent?

00:25:18.934 --> 00:25:20.602
I refused at first.

00:25:20.686 --> 00:25:22.229
But then,

00:25:23.063 --> 00:25:24.940
he wanted to break up with me.

00:25:26.108 --> 00:25:27.860
That's why we broke up,

00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:29.486
but I missed him.

00:25:30.821 --> 00:25:32.031
A lot.

00:25:32.573 --> 00:25:35.492
I couldn't even last a week
and ended up reaching out to him.

00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:36.452
But…

00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:40.581
he wouldn't take me back.

00:25:42.416 --> 00:25:44.043
For a whole month,

00:25:44.668 --> 00:25:46.462
I would call him like crazy,

00:25:47.254 --> 00:25:48.464
I would show up unannounced,

00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:51.425
I would break down in tears,
and make a scene.

00:25:52.051 --> 00:25:56.346
I never imagined that someone
who was so kind and devoted to me

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.809
could also be so cold.

00:26:01.727 --> 00:26:04.605
The sense of loss and emptiness
was so overwhelming,

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.107
I could barely function.

00:26:10.152 --> 00:26:12.696
About a month later,

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.907
he reached out to me.

00:26:15.491 --> 00:26:17.785
That's how we got back together.

00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:21.371
I felt like

00:26:21.997 --> 00:26:24.166
I had the whole world in my hands.

00:26:24.917 --> 00:26:27.544
He must have demanded sadistic sex again.

00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:29.880
Yes.

00:26:29.963 --> 00:26:32.508
Were you aware

00:26:33.133 --> 00:26:35.636
that you have

00:26:35.719 --> 00:26:36.929
keloid-prone skin?

00:26:37.012 --> 00:26:39.264
Of course I was.

00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:42.684
I've dreamed of being a model
since I was a little girl,

00:26:42.768 --> 00:26:45.771
so I've always been careful,

00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:48.065
scared of irritating
even a small paper cut.

00:26:48.148 --> 00:26:51.568
Are you saying you gave consent
despite knowing all that?

00:26:51.652 --> 00:26:53.904
I know it sounds crazy,

00:26:54.863 --> 00:26:56.115
but I had…

00:26:58.325 --> 00:26:59.952
no choice back then.

00:27:00.744 --> 00:27:02.830
Just the thought of him leaving me again…

00:27:03.872 --> 00:27:06.542
I felt like I was gonna die
just thinking about it.

00:27:12.548 --> 00:27:15.050
As Ms. Kang Hyo-min said,

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:18.428
the chances of winning this case are slim.

00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:20.681
If you still want to proceed,

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.935
then we need to frame you
clearly as the victim.

00:27:25.853 --> 00:27:27.813
As someone so weak and incapable

00:27:27.896 --> 00:27:30.399
that you couldn't even
give legally valid consent.

00:27:32.359 --> 00:27:34.194
This alone could be painful.

00:27:35.028 --> 00:27:37.156
Is that how you see me?

00:27:37.906 --> 00:27:38.907
I'm sorry,

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.744
but judging by your story, yes.

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:46.874
I think love made you that way.

00:27:48.417 --> 00:27:51.378
You were
in that diminished state we call love,

00:27:51.461 --> 00:27:53.297
a state that anyone can fall into.

00:27:53.964 --> 00:27:57.050
And unfortunately, you met someone
who took advantage of that.

00:27:57.593 --> 00:27:59.261
Do you…

00:28:00.888 --> 00:28:01.930
I mean,

00:28:02.806 --> 00:28:04.808
does it also happen

00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:06.810
to someone like you?

00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:10.147
Yes.

00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:14.902
The more I love,
the more vulnerable I become.

00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:17.905
In the face of love,

00:28:19.615 --> 00:28:22.075
everyone becomes irrational and weak.

00:28:23.243 --> 00:28:26.413
So love and vulnerability
always go hand in hand.

00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:37.841
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:28:37.925 --> 00:28:39.176
Happy birthday.

00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:48.185
It takes a birthday for us
to come to a place like this.

00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:55.234
What the heck? He's so handsome.

00:28:55.317 --> 00:28:57.069
He really is.

00:28:57.152 --> 00:28:58.737
Look how he's surrounded by women.

00:28:59.655 --> 00:29:01.698
If only there were fewer of them…

00:29:02.658 --> 00:29:03.533
Go on.

00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:05.452
Go and wipe them out.

00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:07.412
Forget it.

00:29:07.913 --> 00:29:09.831
The handsome ones are always trouble.

00:29:09.915 --> 00:29:11.541
That's right.

00:29:11.625 --> 00:29:14.544
He's more your type, Hyo-min.

00:29:15.254 --> 00:29:16.546
What?

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:17.923
You're into those kinds of guys.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.719
Not at all.

00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:28.809
Thank you.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:34.815
I'm sorry.

00:29:35.983 --> 00:29:36.858
It's fine.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.362
You spilled your drinks.

00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:42.364
Let me get you some new ones.

00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:43.740
That's fine.

00:29:44.574 --> 00:29:45.701
It was my fault.

00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:47.160
Some of it was mine too.

00:29:50.247 --> 00:29:52.249
Give her the same drinks,

00:29:52.332 --> 00:29:54.501
and I'll get a gin and tonic, please.

00:29:54.584 --> 00:29:55.502
Okay.

00:30:08.015 --> 00:30:09.141
What's going on?

00:30:09.766 --> 00:30:10.851
No way.

00:30:14.187 --> 00:30:16.315
- Shall I put them here?
- Yes, thank you.

00:30:19.443 --> 00:30:22.237
He said he'd bring them for me

00:30:22.321 --> 00:30:24.364
because I already spilled them once.

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:27.576
That's so kind of you.

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:29.369
Please. Take a seat.

00:30:30.537 --> 00:30:32.331
Should I?

00:30:37.044 --> 00:30:38.211
Are you here alone?

00:30:38.295 --> 00:30:39.629
Yes.

00:30:39.713 --> 00:30:42.215
I saw you hanging out
with a lot of people over there.

00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:46.803
It's what you do… at bars.

00:30:49.222 --> 00:30:51.350
- Should we make toast?
- Sure.

00:31:00.067 --> 00:31:01.860
I've decided to let all that go.

00:31:01.943 --> 00:31:03.153
You have?

00:31:04.821 --> 00:31:06.782
Wait, what do you do exactly?

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:09.409
How can someone look this good,
be this interesting,

00:31:09.493 --> 00:31:10.702
and still be so charming?

00:31:10.786 --> 00:31:12.037
I make mobile games.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.497
Are you a programmer?

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.915
No, I'm the CEO.

00:31:14.998 --> 00:31:17.876
Oh, you're a CEO.

00:31:17.959 --> 00:31:21.380
Don't tell me you're the CEO
of the top company in the industry.

00:31:21.463 --> 00:31:22.798
What's the top company?

00:31:23.423 --> 00:31:27.219
Marble Soft, Horizon, Ruma Entertainment?

00:31:27.302 --> 00:31:28.428
Thank you

00:31:28.512 --> 00:31:30.138
for mentioning my company first.

00:31:31.139 --> 00:31:32.474
I run Marble Soft.

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:33.517
That's my company.

00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:38.313
What's your name?

00:31:39.773 --> 00:31:41.066
Jung Han-seok.

00:31:43.693 --> 00:31:45.028
Who is your ex-boyfriend?

00:31:45.946 --> 00:31:50.075
Jung Han-seok,
the CEO of Marble Soft.

00:31:51.034 --> 00:31:52.536
Marble Soft.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.039
No wonder.
I knew you weren't an ordinary person.

00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:59.251
I read about you in an article.
You really are something.

00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:00.710
Thank you.

00:32:01.628 --> 00:32:04.506
Can you tell me about yourselves?

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:07.634
Sure. I'm Han Seol-a, and I'm a doctor.

00:32:08.802 --> 00:32:09.970
I'm 28.

00:32:10.053 --> 00:32:11.721
I'm two years older than you.

00:32:11.805 --> 00:32:13.723
We're all the same age.

00:32:13.807 --> 00:32:15.392
We're childhood friends.

00:32:15.475 --> 00:32:16.852
You guys go way back.

00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:21.314
We've lived together since college,
so we're roommates too.

00:32:21.398 --> 00:32:23.692
- I see.
- This is Lee Ji-eun.

00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:26.278
- She's a lyricist.
- Are you?

00:32:26.361 --> 00:32:27.571
What songs have you written?

00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:29.948
Nothing too famous.

00:32:30.031 --> 00:32:31.575
Humility isn't really a virtue nowadays.

00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:33.743
She's written a lot of famous songs.

00:32:33.827 --> 00:32:35.162
Right.

00:32:39.666 --> 00:32:41.460
I'm most curious about you.

00:32:41.543 --> 00:32:45.589
I already know
that you're two years younger than me.

00:32:46.298 --> 00:32:47.632
What's your name?

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:52.679
Kang Hyo-min.

00:32:52.762 --> 00:32:53.763
Kang Hyo-min.

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:55.765
Kang Hyo-min.

00:32:57.267 --> 00:32:58.351
What do you do, Hyo-min?

00:33:01.062 --> 00:33:02.147
I just…

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:03.773
She's a lawyer.

00:33:03.857 --> 00:33:05.066
Really?

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.902
She's a hotshot at a big law firm.

00:33:07.944 --> 00:33:10.614
You don't look like a lawyer,

00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:13.950
but you definitely have the aura of one.

00:33:18.038 --> 00:33:20.248
What are you thinking about so deeply?

00:33:20.332 --> 00:33:21.416
Sorry?

00:33:25.545 --> 00:33:28.131
I haven't been a lawyer for long,

00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:31.676
so I'm not sure
I have much of an aura yet.

00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:34.638
A first-year?
That makes sense considering your age.

00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:41.520
I bet you'd look prettier

00:33:42.145 --> 00:33:43.522
if you let your hair down.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.193
Try letting it down.

00:33:49.277 --> 00:33:50.612
Trust me on this. Go on.

00:33:53.406 --> 00:33:54.366
Wait.

00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:07.504
You look so pretty.

00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:23.728
Come in.

00:34:27.232 --> 00:34:28.108
I'm here too.

00:34:28.942 --> 00:34:30.068
Come on in.

00:34:30.819 --> 00:34:33.488
Wow, your office is nice.

00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:36.283
It looks much more spacious
without so much stuff in it.

00:34:36.366 --> 00:34:37.909
How's it going?

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.203
I still feel a little dazed.

00:34:41.162 --> 00:34:43.873
Where I was dispatched to,
I didn't even have an office.

00:34:43.957 --> 00:34:44.833
Right.

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:48.712
An in-house counsel at a mid-sized company
couldn't possibly have an office.

00:34:49.254 --> 00:34:51.131
- Take a seat.
- Sure.

00:34:51.214 --> 00:34:52.465
Here.

00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:54.634
What is this?

00:34:54.718 --> 00:34:56.386
It's the data
for the restructuring process.

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:58.847
The employees subject
to the restructuring measures are marked

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.808
based on their sales
or performance in the past five years.

00:35:02.309 --> 00:35:04.686
Mostly senior advisors
and former officials, I see.

00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:06.938
Yes. We need to go through
with the restructuring first--

00:35:07.022 --> 00:35:10.942
A law firm's rank is based on its revenue
and the number of lawyers, isn't it?

00:35:12.319 --> 00:35:15.280
Isn't the real issue
not that they're still at the firm,

00:35:15.363 --> 00:35:17.699
but that their pay throws off the balance?

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:20.535
Then it needs re-alignment.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.622
We just need to change the bonus system.

00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:25.081
That's right.

00:35:25.624 --> 00:35:27.792
Given the choice between
a pay cut and leaving,

00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:29.836
they'd choose the pay cut.

00:35:30.587 --> 00:35:34.007
What really matters to them
is social status and a sense of belonging.

00:35:34.633 --> 00:35:36.134
They're not the ones

00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:38.553
who actually need to leave.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.555
There are others.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.521
Yes?

00:35:50.273 --> 00:35:51.483
Yul-seong.

00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:53.234
Come in.

00:35:55.403 --> 00:35:56.363
{\an8}No.

00:35:56.446 --> 00:35:59.616
You're a managing partner now.
I should be more polite.

00:35:59.699 --> 00:36:01.618
Just treat me like usual.

00:36:01.701 --> 00:36:03.953
To you, I probably
still look like a first-year.

00:36:04.037 --> 00:36:05.705
No way.

00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:06.748
That's not true.

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.333
Please. Take a seat, Ms. Kwon.

00:36:14.964 --> 00:36:16.091
So you're curious

00:36:17.342 --> 00:36:19.844
why Seung-cheol made you
a managing partner

00:36:19.928 --> 00:36:22.847
when you were previously sidelined
due to office politics.

00:36:22.931 --> 00:36:23.932
Yes.

00:36:24.432 --> 00:36:27.102
I thought you might know something,

00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:29.270
since you've known Mr. Ko for a long time.

00:36:30.897 --> 00:36:34.567
I mean, I've been following Seung-cheol
around since college.

00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:37.070
Still, I don't know
everything that's on his mind.

00:36:38.238 --> 00:36:39.739
One thing's for sure.

00:36:40.657 --> 00:36:42.492
He doesn't just look at the person.

00:36:43.243 --> 00:36:45.161
He looks at the ripple effect they create.

00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:47.205
The ripple effect?

00:36:47.288 --> 00:36:49.457
He probably put you in this position

00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:51.501
not just for the ripple you'd create,

00:36:51.584 --> 00:36:54.129
but for the momentum it would build
and the outdated structures

00:36:54.212 --> 00:36:55.588
it would eventually break down.

00:36:55.672 --> 00:36:57.507
He never holds the sword himself.

00:36:58.133 --> 00:36:59.843
He just calculates how it will swing.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.222
Isn't that a little risky, then?

00:37:04.305 --> 00:37:07.475
Someone more political

00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:10.186
and easier to manage
would probably be better than me.

00:37:11.646 --> 00:37:14.107
But someone like that
can't change the system.

00:37:14.733 --> 00:37:17.318
They're too flexible.
They bend to fit the mold.

00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:20.822
The way I see it, you're not the sword.
You're the one who wields it.

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:23.283
Someone who swings
the sword their own way.

00:37:23.783 --> 00:37:26.703
So go ahead and swing it
in your own style.

00:37:27.537 --> 00:37:28.455
Make it count.

00:37:30.623 --> 00:37:31.624
Should I?

00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:40.592
"As the consent is not legally valid,
the offense of assault applies."

00:37:41.885 --> 00:37:42.927
Seriously?

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.388
Is this worth responding to?

00:37:46.765 --> 00:37:47.974
Well,

00:37:48.057 --> 00:37:50.059
legally speaking,
I don't think we would lose.

00:37:50.143 --> 00:37:53.104
It is a very provocative issue,
so it might create unnecessary noise.

00:37:53.188 --> 00:37:54.105
Right.

00:37:54.189 --> 00:37:57.650
I can't allow my personal tastes
to become gossip for others.

00:37:59.736 --> 00:38:01.738
We'll start with a meeting
between the lawyers

00:38:01.821 --> 00:38:03.531
and try to settle things there.

00:38:03.615 --> 00:38:04.783
Please do that.

00:38:06.242 --> 00:38:08.661
I'm sorry to trouble you
with something so personal.

00:38:08.745 --> 00:38:10.914
Not at all. Don't mention it.

00:38:10.997 --> 00:38:14.417
You are Marble Soft,
and Marble Soft is you.

00:38:14.501 --> 00:38:16.669
This kind of personal litigation
isn't entirely personal.

00:38:16.753 --> 00:38:18.797
{\an8}With the IPO coming up,
we can't afford any noise.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.089
{\an8}A COMPANY'S FIRST STOCK LISTING

00:38:23.092 --> 00:38:25.011
Who's representing the plaintiff?

00:38:25.094 --> 00:38:27.931
It's Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon
and Ms. Kang Hyo-min from Yullim.

00:38:29.015 --> 00:38:30.016
Kang Hyo-min?

00:38:30.642 --> 00:38:31.976
Did you just say Kang Hyo-min?

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:32.977
Yes.

00:38:33.478 --> 00:38:34.729
Let me see the complaint.

00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:41.653
What's wrong?

00:38:42.862 --> 00:38:43.863
Interesting.

00:38:50.286 --> 00:38:52.747
COMPLAINT
ATTORNEYS YOON SEOK-HOON, KANG HYO-MIN

00:38:52.831 --> 00:38:54.791
The recourse claim lawsuit
has been resolved,

00:38:54.874 --> 00:38:58.711
and the Labor Office's administrative
hearing has been set for next month.

00:38:58.795 --> 00:39:00.129
- Okay.
- Yes.

00:39:01.256 --> 00:39:02.423
Ms. Kang Hyo-min.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:06.761
Ms. Kang?

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.805
What are you doing?

00:39:09.556 --> 00:39:10.473
Yes.

00:39:10.557 --> 00:39:13.935
Is the claim that love impairs judgment
shaping up well?

00:39:14.978 --> 00:39:16.187
Yes.

00:39:16.688 --> 00:39:18.439
Give it your best shot.

00:39:18.523 --> 00:39:20.108
I will.

00:39:21.276 --> 00:39:23.611
- If that's everything, let's wrap it up.
- Okay.

00:39:24.487 --> 00:39:25.446
Mr. Yoon.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:31.953
Not that I'm comparing or anything,

00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:34.247
but the antitrust law
and the financial law teams

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:37.584
have already had three team dinners.

00:39:38.751 --> 00:39:42.422
Are we not going to have one?

00:39:42.505 --> 00:39:43.673
Mr. Ji.

00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:49.679
I have something important to do today,
so I'll leave you my credit card.

00:39:50.346 --> 00:39:53.349
Still, it's our first get-together.
Why don't you join us?

00:39:53.975 --> 00:39:55.602
I'll join if work allows.

00:39:55.685 --> 00:39:57.103
Okay. Thank you.

00:39:57.186 --> 00:39:58.563
Is there a limit on the card?

00:39:58.646 --> 00:39:59.772
Of course not.

00:40:03.818 --> 00:40:05.528
Didn't know you had it in you!

00:40:15.997 --> 00:40:17.790
PAYMENT APPROVED
760,000 WON, OMAKASE

430,000 WON, JAPANESE PUB

00:40:48.696 --> 00:40:50.156
Yes, meet me at the entrance.

00:40:50.698 --> 00:40:51.741
Okay.

00:41:03.628 --> 00:41:06.005
KANG HYO-MIN
ARE YUO NOT COING?

00:41:06.089 --> 00:41:07.548
ARE YOU NOY COMUNG?

00:41:08.174 --> 00:41:09.509
ARU YOU NOT CIMING?

00:41:09.592 --> 00:41:10.927
How much did they drink?

00:41:20.436 --> 00:41:25.108
BA CARD PAYMENT APPROVED
260,000 WON, BEAR PUB

00:41:25.191 --> 00:41:26.401
Jeez, they drank a lot.

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:28.111
Mr. Hwang,

00:41:28.903 --> 00:41:30.238
is Bear Pub nearby?

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:32.031
We're about to pass it.

00:41:32.115 --> 00:41:33.825
Can you head that way?

00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:35.076
Okay.

00:41:39.455 --> 00:41:43.418
Why isn't Heo Min-jeong
answering her phone?

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.338
No matter how busy she is,
she should come to the get-together.

00:41:47.422 --> 00:41:49.298
- Take me with you!
- Jeez.

00:41:49.382 --> 00:41:51.718
Heo Min-jeong!

00:41:54.554 --> 00:41:57.557
No. Take your shoes off,
and I'll massage them.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.058
- I'm gonna…
- What?

00:41:59.142 --> 00:42:00.476
…head home now.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.228
- Okay.
- Bye.

00:42:02.311 --> 00:42:05.023
- Bye. See you tomorrow!
- Bye.

00:42:05.106 --> 00:42:07.650
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

00:42:07.734 --> 00:42:09.444
- Good job today!
- Thanks!

00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:11.237
Taxi!

00:42:13.239 --> 00:42:15.533
Are you available?

00:42:16.451 --> 00:42:17.702
Do you need a cab?

00:42:18.327 --> 00:42:19.620
It's Yoon Seok-hoon.

00:42:19.704 --> 00:42:20.955
Mr. Yoon!

00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:22.707
What took you so long?

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:26.919
Do you know how long
we've been waiting for you?

00:42:27.003 --> 00:42:30.006
Okay. Just hop in.

00:42:30.089 --> 00:42:31.132
Let me take you home.

00:42:32.091 --> 00:42:33.426
Mr. Hwang, have her sit up front.

00:42:33.509 --> 00:42:34.594
Okay.

00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:36.095
You're a total meanie.

00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:38.014
Let me.

00:42:43.144 --> 00:42:44.187
Are you okay?

00:42:47.273 --> 00:42:48.232
Gosh.

00:42:49.692 --> 00:42:52.528
At this rate,
her head isn't going to survive.

00:42:53.279 --> 00:42:54.697
I'm fine. I'm…

00:43:06.834 --> 00:43:07.960
Have some water.

00:43:09.337 --> 00:43:11.047
Thank… you.

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:15.426
Take small sips, or you'll throw up.

00:43:16.177 --> 00:43:17.095
Okay.

00:43:23.518 --> 00:43:24.560
Are you okay?

00:43:25.103 --> 00:43:26.145
I'm fine.

00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:29.982
Here.

00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:32.819
Thank… you.

00:43:36.989 --> 00:43:39.033
It's the third handkerchief.

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:45.748
Mr. Yoon,

00:43:45.832 --> 00:43:47.959
what cologne do you use?

00:43:49.585 --> 00:43:51.003
It smells good.

00:43:57.009 --> 00:43:58.636
Please pull over if you see a pharmacy.

00:43:59.512 --> 00:44:00.930
Okay.

00:44:20.283 --> 00:44:22.785
ANMYEONG PHARMACY

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:25.997
Take one of them

00:44:26.747 --> 00:44:28.166
with this drink.

00:44:29.208 --> 00:44:30.126
Okay.

00:44:31.586 --> 00:44:32.628
This is inappropriate.

00:44:32.712 --> 00:44:33.921
It's inappropriate.

00:44:36.716 --> 00:44:38.551
This is inappropriate, Kang Hyo-min!

00:45:15.254 --> 00:45:16.339
What is it?

00:45:16.923 --> 00:45:19.300
What is it? What's wrong?

00:45:20.051 --> 00:45:22.845
Min-jeong. Why are you here?

00:45:25.223 --> 00:45:27.016
I knew you'd pull this crap.

00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:28.893
I knew you'd play dumb.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.145
After what you put me through last night.

00:45:31.229 --> 00:45:32.313
I did?

00:45:33.856 --> 00:45:35.608
Go shower.
I gotta shower after I work out.

00:45:35.691 --> 00:45:37.068
What did you do with my clothes?

00:45:38.736 --> 00:45:39.862
I folded them.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.496
What the heck did I do last night?

00:45:50.248 --> 00:45:51.832
My head is killing me, damn it.

00:46:30.913 --> 00:46:32.123
What's with those eyes?

00:46:34.083 --> 00:46:35.418
What?

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:43.342
Don't pull that macho act in front of me.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.429
We're coworkers.

00:46:47.054 --> 00:46:48.347
What are you talking about?

00:46:48.431 --> 00:46:49.890
I'm just naturally manly.

00:46:51.017 --> 00:46:52.476
I'm gonna wash up. Have some soup.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.020
Can't you set the table?

00:46:55.855 --> 00:46:57.189
Got it.

00:47:02.737 --> 00:47:03.612
It's good.

00:47:07.575 --> 00:47:09.368
Aren't you having any?

00:47:09.452 --> 00:47:10.536
I don't eat breakfast.

00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:12.038
I see.

00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:14.749
And you just happened to have
some hangover soup?

00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:16.959
Are you kidding me?

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:19.295
I made it last night.

00:47:19.378 --> 00:47:20.338
To feed you.

00:47:22.298 --> 00:47:23.758
I feel like I'm your husband.

00:47:23.841 --> 00:47:25.426
You little…

00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:27.803
By the way,

00:47:28.554 --> 00:47:30.139
what happened last night?

00:47:30.222 --> 00:47:31.307
Of course.

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.351
Of course you don't remember.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.269
HEO MIN-JEONG

00:47:35.353 --> 00:47:36.812
She picked up.

00:47:37.313 --> 00:47:39.982
Where are you, Min-jeong?

00:47:40.066 --> 00:47:41.692
Come now!

00:47:41.776 --> 00:47:44.862
You made such a fuss
about getting me to come,

00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:46.489
and you were completely wasted.

00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:49.450
Why did you change your door code?

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.496
You should have told me.

00:47:53.579 --> 00:47:55.414
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:47:55.956 --> 00:47:58.042
You've always dropped me off at home,

00:47:58.125 --> 00:47:59.585
so this is my first time here.

00:48:00.419 --> 00:48:01.337
Right.

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:04.173
Who's the person in the photo
next to your bed?

00:48:05.007 --> 00:48:06.258
Who?

00:48:06.342 --> 00:48:08.219
You know…

00:48:08.302 --> 00:48:10.721
I saw a full-figured woman.

00:48:10.805 --> 00:48:12.223
Oh, that's me.

00:48:13.015 --> 00:48:15.017
- What?
- That's me.

00:48:16.018 --> 00:48:17.478
When was that?

00:48:18.145 --> 00:48:20.940
It was about seven years ago,
so I was in my mid-thirties.

00:48:26.153 --> 00:48:29.323
You look a lot younger now.

00:48:29.407 --> 00:48:30.324
- Right?
- Yes.

00:48:30.408 --> 00:48:32.118
It's important to take care of yourself.

00:48:32.201 --> 00:48:33.994
- So it seems.
- Yes.

00:48:37.289 --> 00:48:40.626
Who was that lady the other day?
The one who came to the office.

00:48:41.252 --> 00:48:42.294
Who?

00:48:42.378 --> 00:48:44.630
She came with the divorce case,
but you turned her down.

00:48:44.713 --> 00:48:46.674
Mr. Kim Yul-seong kept going on

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:48.509
about how you turned down a client.

00:48:49.009 --> 00:48:50.344
Do you know her?

00:48:50.428 --> 00:48:51.512
She's my husband's mistress.

00:48:52.221 --> 00:48:53.472
Hey!

00:48:53.556 --> 00:48:54.932
Come on!

00:48:55.683 --> 00:48:57.435
You're being such a handful.

00:48:57.518 --> 00:48:58.436
Hey.

00:48:59.019 --> 00:49:00.312
Thanks.

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:05.234
Ex-husband, to be exact.

00:49:05.985 --> 00:49:09.530
That mistress came to me
to divorce my ex-husband.

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:13.242
I'm in utter shock.

00:49:13.325 --> 00:49:14.702
My heart is beating so fast.

00:49:15.536 --> 00:49:17.121
What shocked you?

00:49:17.204 --> 00:49:18.622
That I'm a divorcée?

00:49:18.706 --> 00:49:20.541
Or that my ex-husband cheated on me?

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:23.043
Or that the mistress had the nerve
to come to me?

00:49:23.127 --> 00:49:24.587
All of it!

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:26.797
But if I had to choose the most shocking,

00:49:27.423 --> 00:49:28.591
it's that you were married.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.259
I have a kid too.

00:49:30.342 --> 00:49:31.927
- A kid?
- She's 20.

00:49:34.305 --> 00:49:36.765
Do you have feelings for me or something?

00:49:40.352 --> 00:49:42.229
Where did that come from?

00:49:42.313 --> 00:49:43.314
Stop lying.

00:49:43.397 --> 00:49:45.524
What are you so surprised about?

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.735
Are you for real?

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:48.819
Yes.

00:49:51.322 --> 00:49:53.824
We practically spent
three years glued at the hip.

00:49:53.908 --> 00:49:56.118
We've shared enough meals
to build a road to Busan.

00:49:56.202 --> 00:49:57.369
And all that time…

00:49:57.453 --> 00:49:59.121
I never talked about my past.

00:50:00.122 --> 00:50:01.373
Did you not?

00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:04.752
Why did I think I knew you to your core?

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:07.379
You do. You just don't know my past.

00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:09.006
Your past…

00:50:09.089 --> 00:50:13.260
If we're talking about who I am today,
you know me better than anyone.

00:50:13.344 --> 00:50:15.346
So, do you feel any better now?

00:50:15.429 --> 00:50:16.514
No.

00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:18.849
Let's get going if you're done.

00:50:18.933 --> 00:50:19.892
Hang on.

00:50:19.975 --> 00:50:21.810
Lay it all out. I want the full story.

00:50:22.811 --> 00:50:24.355
Starting from what age?

00:50:24.438 --> 00:50:25.773
The earliest you can remember.

00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:30.569
My brain's in full gear.

00:50:30.653 --> 00:50:32.321
Seriously! I'm not joking.

00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:39.995
So you're saying

00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:43.040
you're pleading diminished capacity
because she was in love?

00:50:44.583 --> 00:50:48.546
So if we assume
that half the population is in love,

00:50:48.629 --> 00:50:53.050
are you saying all the contracts
signed by that half aren't legally valid?

00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:56.011
Gosh.

00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:04.311
Mr. Jung Han-seok of Marble Soft is here.

00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:07.064
- Let him in.
- Okay.

00:51:15.406 --> 00:51:16.949
What brings you here?

00:51:17.449 --> 00:51:19.451
My work wrapped up early, so I dropped by.

00:51:19.535 --> 00:51:21.287
I see. Take a seat.

00:51:31.714 --> 00:51:33.090
Don't let me interrupt you.

00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:37.803
Anyway, we reject
the claims made in the complaint.

00:51:37.886 --> 00:51:41.223
Isn't this just a threat
disguised as legal action,

00:51:41.307 --> 00:51:43.309
using my client's reputation as leverage?

00:51:43.392 --> 00:51:44.852
Watch your words.

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:45.936
A threat?

00:51:47.229 --> 00:51:49.648
One party suffered irreparable harm
for the sole purpose

00:51:49.732 --> 00:51:52.735
of the other's sexual gratification.

00:51:55.362 --> 00:51:57.114
What exactly is your client demanding?

00:51:57.865 --> 00:51:59.908
If you look at the pictures here,
the scars--

00:51:59.992 --> 00:52:01.910
I hate drawn-out discussions.

00:52:02.828 --> 00:52:03.829
What does she want?

00:52:04.455 --> 00:52:06.749
Legal punishment and damage compensation.

00:52:10.461 --> 00:52:11.378
Did you make

00:52:12.212 --> 00:52:13.964
this document, Ms. Kang?

00:52:17.593 --> 00:52:18.719
Yes.

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:20.095
As the victim testified--

00:52:20.179 --> 00:52:21.096
The victim?

00:52:21.722 --> 00:52:22.723
Who's the victim?

00:52:23.223 --> 00:52:25.601
A lawyer shouldn't use words so loosely.

00:52:25.684 --> 00:52:28.562
She's a complainant.
Anyone can file a complaint.

00:52:29.521 --> 00:52:31.023
As the complainant testified--

00:52:31.106 --> 00:52:33.734
So are you saying
that I deliberately approached

00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:35.778
Seol Eun-yeong like she was prey,

00:52:35.861 --> 00:52:38.197
used my superior looks
and social status to wage

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.407
some kind of psychological warfare,
gaslighted her

00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:44.036
into a mentally compromised state,
and that any consent she gave

00:52:44.536 --> 00:52:45.496
is not valid?

00:52:45.579 --> 00:52:48.123
And so, I should be punished
for assault and pay for damages?

00:52:48.207 --> 00:52:49.792
- Yes.
- That's pure fiction.

00:52:50.376 --> 00:52:51.418
Lousy fiction.

00:52:56.423 --> 00:52:59.927
I want to speak privately with Ms. Kang.
Can you leave us for a moment?

00:53:01.095 --> 00:53:02.930
Why? What is it?

00:53:04.556 --> 00:53:05.808
What's this about?

00:53:08.435 --> 00:53:09.770
I'll tell Ms. Kang

00:53:10.354 --> 00:53:12.231
what this is about.

00:53:18.821 --> 00:53:20.280
Look at your faces.

00:53:20.906 --> 00:53:21.949
I won't hurt her.

00:54:04.199 --> 00:54:05.117
What did he say?

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:07.828
Right.

00:54:32.186 --> 00:54:33.103
You look so pretty.

00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:40.819
I told you you look prettier
with your hair down.

00:54:48.994 --> 00:54:51.205
How do you know Mr. Jung?

00:54:52.623 --> 00:54:55.292
I met him at a bar a few days ago.

00:54:55.834 --> 00:54:59.004
I thought it might be useful
to get a feel for who he is,

00:54:59.087 --> 00:55:01.381
so I talked to him briefly.

00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:04.635
Are you saying
you approached him intentionally?

00:55:04.718 --> 00:55:06.178
To dig up something useful?

00:55:06.678 --> 00:55:10.015
- It wasn't intentional.
- Haven't you heard of legal ethics?

00:55:10.098 --> 00:55:11.683
Article 45 of the Code of Ethics

00:55:12.434 --> 00:55:15.479
prohibits direct communication
with a represented party.

00:55:15.562 --> 00:55:18.148
What are you doing
acting like some cheap attorney?

00:55:18.232 --> 00:55:19.107
Cheap?

00:55:19.191 --> 00:55:21.235
Yes. Cheap.

00:55:22.027 --> 00:55:24.446
Forming a close relationship
with the opposing party

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:26.990
violates the duty
to uphold professional dignity.

00:55:27.074 --> 00:55:29.493
Wouldn't you call
an attorney without integrity "cheap"?

00:55:29.576 --> 00:55:32.120
I don't have
a close relationship with him.

00:55:32.204 --> 00:55:33.330
What did I see, then?

00:55:33.413 --> 00:55:34.623
It's not like that!

00:55:35.123 --> 00:55:37.584
And do you follow every rule
in the code of ethics?

00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:38.544
Kang Hyo-min!

00:55:41.129 --> 00:55:43.006
Didn't I tell you to tread carefully?

00:55:59.731 --> 00:56:00.816
{\an8}THE ART OF MAGIC

00:56:07.781 --> 00:56:08.782
CONTACTS

00:56:08.866 --> 00:56:10.117
KANG HYO-MIN

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.412
The person you have called
cannot be reached at the moment.

00:56:14.746 --> 00:56:16.039
Seriously…

00:56:29.511 --> 00:56:31.346
Hello, Kang Hyo-min speaking.

00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:32.431
It's me.

00:56:32.514 --> 00:56:34.266
I'm calling from my office

00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:36.226
since it seems you blocked my number.

00:56:36.768 --> 00:56:37.811
What do you need?

00:56:37.895 --> 00:56:39.855
Do you know Jung Han-seok personally?

00:56:39.938 --> 00:56:41.607
Why is that any of your concern?

00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:43.275
How do you two know each other?

00:56:43.775 --> 00:56:45.652
Why the hell is he treating you like that?

00:56:45.736 --> 00:56:47.070
Why did he touch you like that?

00:56:48.572 --> 00:56:49.656
Mr. Han,

00:56:50.157 --> 00:56:53.160
is this really a conversation
we should be having?

00:56:56.455 --> 00:56:57.664
Where are you?

00:56:59.291 --> 00:57:00.417
Let's meet.

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.711
We have no business seeing each other.

00:57:05.047 --> 00:57:05.964
Hyo-min.

00:57:23.148 --> 00:57:24.483
Damn it.

00:58:24.292 --> 00:58:25.168
KANG HYO-MIN

00:58:27.504 --> 00:58:28.672
Hello, Ms. Kang.

00:58:29.297 --> 00:58:30.424
Go on.

00:58:32.217 --> 00:58:35.262
I still have some work left,
so I'm heading back to the office.

00:58:36.763 --> 00:58:37.639
Yes.

00:58:38.557 --> 00:58:39.641
Sure.

00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:57.909
Why didn't you tell me?

00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:01.079
I didn't realize you were
the opposing counsel,

00:59:01.163 --> 00:59:02.998
so I said more than I should have.

00:59:03.874 --> 00:59:04.958
I enjoyed it.

00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:08.712
It was a kind of sexual satisfaction

00:59:09.671 --> 00:59:12.257
rooted in emotional intimacy
and mental stimulation.

00:59:13.842 --> 00:59:14.885
I'm sorry.

00:59:14.968 --> 00:59:17.679
I should have told you
that I represent Ms. Seol.

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:20.932
I didn't mean to keep it a secret.
I just--

00:59:21.016 --> 00:59:22.017
Just what?

00:59:22.517 --> 00:59:25.562
Were you fishing for something
you could use to your advantage?

00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:29.191
I'll let it go.

00:59:30.442 --> 00:59:31.610
I like you.

00:59:31.693 --> 00:59:33.403
Please don't complicate things.

00:59:33.487 --> 00:59:34.696
What can I do?

00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:36.907
If I want to simplify something
that's complicated,

00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:38.283
what do I do?

00:59:41.078 --> 00:59:42.954
We should probably wrap
this up first, right?

00:59:43.038 --> 00:59:46.708
That way, there won't be
a conflict of interest between us.

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.211
Is compensation what Eun-yeong wants?

00:59:50.003 --> 00:59:51.296
Yes.

00:59:59.638 --> 01:00:01.264
Write down the amount.

01:00:01.348 --> 01:00:02.933
I'll accept whatever you write.

01:00:07.896 --> 01:00:10.315
I didn't know she was in that state.

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:11.858
I'm worried.

01:00:14.653 --> 01:00:17.364
You should express
your feelings toward her yourself.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:18.490
No.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.743
I'm not worried about her.

01:00:22.661 --> 01:00:24.287
I'm worried about

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:26.081
what you might think of me.

01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:28.291
I'm not a perv or a sadist.

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:30.127
It was just the kind of erotic expression

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:32.546
you'd expect between ordinary couples.

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:36.466
But her skin was just

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.844
a little unusual.

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:42.556
I want to go out with you.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:44.141
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:46.852
- I'm not asking for anything right now.
- Mr. Jung.

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.149
Let her name her price on the check

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:53.984
and sign the NDA.

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:57.154
I tolerated this for your sake,
but this is as far as that goes.

01:00:57.237 --> 01:00:59.948
If you push this any further,

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:02.659
people will watch the video
and decide for themselves

01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:05.412
whether it was actual consent or not.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:09.207
The video?

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:11.251
I guess Eun-yeong didn't tell you that.

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:13.128
I have a video.

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:16.965
Of course,
she agreed to record it as well.

01:01:22.721 --> 01:01:23.722
I'll call you.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:38.945
A video?

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:40.238
Yes.

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.117
I don't know where to draw
the line with the client.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.204
That was reckless of me.

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:48.455
I'm sorry.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.544
Why do you think
the client filed this lawsuit?

01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:58.757
Compensation

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:01.551
for her wounds?

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:03.386
I'd say it's emotional, not physical.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:07.307
Do you know

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:10.268
why I let you join my team?

01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:12.896
Because I was the top of my class?

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:14.022
Because I seemed smart?

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:16.024
No.

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:20.403
Because you understand
the essence of the lawsuit.

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:24.491
Love comes in many different shades.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:28.036
Heterosexual, homosexual,
maternal, paternal, reverential,

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:31.164
brotherhood, friendship, camaraderie,
love for humanity, and self-love.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:32.916
And that love hurts people.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:37.128
Once that wound festers,
they consider legal action.

01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:39.589
At that breaking point,
they believe their last resort,

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:43.009
the lawsuit, will protect
their happiness and their right to it.

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:46.054
I want to represent people like that.

01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:49.266
Because it'd be fun?

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:52.102
You're right.

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:55.814
People turn to lawsuits
when the pain becomes too much.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:58.775
And at that breaking point,

01:03:00.485 --> 01:03:03.363
they believe their last resort,
the lawsuit,

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.991
will protect their happiness
and their right to it.

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:08.785
I'm sure Ms. Seol felt the same.

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:12.122
When you meet a client wanting
to heal their scars through a lawsuit,

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:14.833
you need to look beneath the scars.

01:03:17.419 --> 01:03:22.340
Winning the case or receiving compensation
isn't always the only form of comfort.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.426
Yes, sir.

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:27.262
The NDA they're offering
is probably one-sided.

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:28.972
I guess so.

01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:32.392
I bet the breakup was like that too.

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:37.856
Revise the NDA
so that it applies both ways

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:39.399
and present it to the client.

01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:41.151
Both ways?

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:45.196
I'm on it.

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:48.825
Is that what he really said?

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:51.911
Did you consent to being recorded?

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:53.288
That's…

01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:55.832
Back then…

01:03:59.127 --> 01:04:00.337
Let's try it this way.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.630
The NDA they want

01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:04.382
only applies one way.

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:07.052
Let's revise it to make it mutual
and propose that instead.

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:09.179
That way he can't leak the video--

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:12.098
He's not someone who would leak it.

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:14.809
Still, you need the legal protection.

01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:18.146
I guess I do, right?

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:20.940
And about the compensation…

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:23.401
I'll just take the actual expenses.

01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:25.403
My medical and legal fees.

01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:28.323
Why on earth…

01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:30.700
I didn't do this to get money.

01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:34.996
But then again, I don't know

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:36.956
why I did it.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:40.210
He just ended it on his own terms.

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:43.671
The breakup alone
was hard enough to accept.

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:48.426
But the fact that I'm the only one
left with such deep scars

01:04:49.427 --> 01:04:50.720
feels unfair.

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:54.015
I even lost my job because of it,

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:56.810
while he's out there thriving.

01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:01.314
I just felt like I had to do something.

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:05.944
Throughout the relationship,
I was always the one being dragged along.

01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:09.364
I think part of me just wanted
to break free from that helplessness.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.869
I don't need money anymore.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:19.666
What hurt me the most was blaming myself.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:24.212
But when you said even love can be
a kind of diminished capacity,

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:26.673
it made me realize I wasn't being weak

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:30.385
and that anyone can end up like that
when they're in love.

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:33.430
Hearing your words…

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:38.184
really comforted me.

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:43.690
I hope your heart
doesn't scar like a keloid.

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:48.361
The end of love always leaves a scar,

01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:53.450
but I hope it doesn't linger as pain.

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:56.202
I hope so too.

01:05:57.537 --> 01:06:00.248
Just like we revised
the NDA to go both ways,

01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:02.876
the breakup should be mutual too.

01:06:05.003 --> 01:06:06.045
Yes.

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:08.131
End it with dignity.

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:12.760
Let that final moment
be the one that stays with you.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:19.893
Okay. I will.

01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:27.192
You can sign here.

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:30.111
PARTY A: JUNG HAN-SEOK

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:33.531
Here.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.785
PARTY B: SEOL EUN-YEONG

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:51.883
Jung Han-seok.

01:06:56.054 --> 01:06:57.138
Let's talk.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:11.027
Did you have to take it this far?

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.488
It's so tiring.

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:20.370
You said that often.

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:23.039
If making me the monster helps you cope,

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:25.083
go ahead.

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:26.834
But save it

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:29.921
for the privacy of your own home.

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:31.923
I won't make you a monster.

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:33.841
Also,

01:07:34.634 --> 01:07:38.012
I won't distort the good times we had.

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:42.475
Just because your feelings have changed,

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:45.520
it doesn't mean
I doubt your feelings back then.

01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:47.772
It's not that I trust you.

01:07:49.107 --> 01:07:50.483
I trust myself.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:56.906
I'm the kind of woman a man like you

01:07:58.992 --> 01:08:00.451
could truly fall for.

01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:18.720
Going to the office?
I can give you a ride.

01:08:18.803 --> 01:08:20.888
No, thanks. Just go on your way.

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:23.766
Now that things are wrapped up,

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:24.934
can't we see each other?

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.895
You're not my type.

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:29.981
Playing hard to get can be fun too.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.192
You're having a hard time facing reality.

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:37.030
If only loving someone
required a certification.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:40.116
Then people like you
wouldn't be able to misuse

01:08:40.199 --> 01:08:42.160
something so noble for mere gratification.

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:45.913
It's such a shame that
a perfect, well-rounded woman like you

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:48.082
doesn't know

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:49.834
how to enjoy life.

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:52.712
You're the one missing something.

01:08:53.338 --> 01:08:56.591
Restraint and a pure heart
broaden the spectrum of emotion.

01:08:56.674 --> 01:09:00.637
At the far end of that spectrum
lies the one thing you don't know.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:04.182
The emotion you will never know.

01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:07.060
That's the real shame.

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:15.193
That's disappointing.

01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:45.973
ROSEMARY

01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:23.970
APPLICATION FOR CONFIRMATION
OF AGREEMENT TO DIVORCE

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:25.638
Okay.

01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:29.517
Let's get divorced.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:35.982
But…

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.194
let me keep Hash once a week.

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:43.239
Okay.

01:10:43.865 --> 01:10:46.200
Can you keep making me
the cologne and soap?

01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:48.286
I will.

01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:52.123
I'll make sure you don't run out.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:51.659
BEYOND THE BAR

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:53.828
This new policy will be
implemented going forward.

01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:55.580
I mean, you only just took office.

01:12:55.663 --> 01:12:59.166
{\an8}How can you change the incentive system
without our consensus?

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:01.085
{\an8}How long must we watch you
bleed associates dry?

01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:03.421
{\an8}Then how much longer
are we expected to let this go on?

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:05.464
{\an8}Should we start digging up dirt on Yoon?

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:07.967
{\an8}I already have someone on him. Be patient.

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.970
{\an8}The defendant has been criminally reported
by his wife's younger brother

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:12.930
{\an8}and charged
with aiding and abetting suicide.

01:13:13.014 --> 01:13:15.725
{\an8}I don't need a lawyer.
I'll just accept my punishment.

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:17.643
{\an8}It's all thanks to you.

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:19.395
{\an8}- Are you almost done?
- Oh my gosh!

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:23.024
{\an8}And we respectfully request
that the defendant be acquitted.

01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:24.650
{\an8}Can we meet up?

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:30.990
