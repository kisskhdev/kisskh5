THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,

SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA

CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS

Seokcheol.

00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:21.016
It's all right.

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:26.229
Let's go.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.318
Get on. I'll go put the luggage in.

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.157
Oh, my goodness!

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:28.041
Seokcheol? Seokcheol!

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:29.126
Seokcheol!

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:31.420
Seokcheol!

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.338
Seokcheol! Seokcheol!

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:36.675
Seokcheol!

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:40.011
After all, I saw this coming.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.140
I knew I'd hesitate

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.810
and end up like this.

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:53.525
I wanted to become a poet.

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.613
I wanted to become a novelist.

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:04.786

{\an8}

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.597
{\an8}That was such a beautiful poem.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.974
{\an8}All right, who'd like to go next?

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:47.078
{\an8}"On the Way Home"

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.122
{\an8}by Park Seokcheol.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.959
{\an8}"My slippers sink deep in the snow,

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:54.878
{\an8}"My bare feet all frozen.

{\an8}"I wonder where I am headed.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.634
{\an8}"With my socks in my hand
I wonder where I'm walking.

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.303
{\an8}"I step on a sharp knife

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.722
"And wonder who threw it out.

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:08.809
"It was heated and hammered
Into a beautifully sharp knife.

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:10.602
"It slashes."

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:11.937
"Stabs

"Defleshes, and kills.

"Something warm touches my frozen feet.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.697
"Is it my urine or your blood?"

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.244
"Blood drips from the knife.

"My slippers sink deep in the snow

00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:37.295
"I return home."

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.676
That's all.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.680
I guess it's very descriptive.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:49.140
But it's a little scary.

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:54.688
Your poetic expressions
seem different from those of others.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:58.650
How should I put it?
It's raw and menacing.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.819
All right, let's stop here.

00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:04.906
When it comes to looking at the world
from a poetic point of view,

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.409
there's no boundary
between beauty and ugliness.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:11.705
In that sense,
your poem portrays honesty and sorrow.

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.666
And a kind of passion, as well.
It's very nice.

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.167
Let's give him a hand.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:24.968
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.849
Seokcheol, good job today.

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.226
I really liked your poem.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.978
- Thank you.
- Good-bye.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.150
Do you know what he does for a living?

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:41.943
I'm not sure.

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.362
I heard he works
at a construction company.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.281
You really don't know?

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:50.035
He's a gangster.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.048
What's up?

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:05.091
Hey, Seokcheol. Are you at home?

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:08.261
Me? I came out for some work
in the morning. Why?

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.472
It's about your fight
in Woljeong-dong.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.892
Are you guys still stuck on that?

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.812
Look, nothing happened that day,
no one got hurt.

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.397
So why can't you just let it go?

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:21.399
Because we're the police, you punk.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.026
I'm on my way to your house.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.862
What? Why are you coming to my house?

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:27.489
Hey--

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.158
- Listen, I need to go.
- Seokcheol--

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.744
- Yes, boss?
- Where are you?

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:36.873
I was out exercising.
I'm going to the office now.

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:39.209
I'm on my way to your house
with the Chairman right now.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.961
- Meet us there, not at the office.
- What? My house--

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:45.048
I'm heading to your house
with Kang Taehoon and the Chairman.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.508
I'll see you there.

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:48.301
Hello? Hello--

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.012
You gotta be kidding me.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:57.143
I can't believe I'm being summoned,
like I'm some misbehaving child.

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:01.523
Are we there yet?

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:03.525
Almost.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:29.259
BAEKMUN 1-DONG
ADMINISTRATIVE WELFARE CENTER

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:41.730
Hello.

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:42.897
Hello.

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:44.733
This way, please.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:47.861
It's so nice to meet you in person.

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:52.532
Is this meeting too early for you?

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:53.992
No, it's all right.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.536
How about some coffee
before we get started?

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:57.620
Sure.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.138
Good job, buddy.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:18.058
It must've been hard
working through the long winter.

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.813
Why bother wiping a dead lightbulb?

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:28.276
Look at that. You're growing beautifully.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.487
All my hard work has paid off.

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:39.287
- What is it?
- Father.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.707
What is this I hear
about the Chairman coming to our house?

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:47.295
Captain Jang of Myoungsan Police Station
kept asking me to help mediate,

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:48.838
so I asked him to come over.

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:49.923
Mediate what?

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:52.675
I heard you guys had another fight
with Taehoon and his men.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.679
The police received
a lot of complaints about it.

00:09:57.388 --> 00:09:59.766
I have to go. I'm getting another call.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.184
Uh--

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:03.144
Jeez.

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:34.342
I swear, this house is literally
like a den of thugs.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.307
Sir, do you mind looking at this video
to understand the situation better?

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:45.311
It happened near a club
in Woljeong-dong two days ago.

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.814
Fortunately, a civilian called it in,

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:51.401
and we took care of the situation
before it got out of hand.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:52.485
As you already know,

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:55.697
cases related to gangsters
are a headache for the police too.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:02.537
So, we've come here today
to ask you to help us reach a resolution.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.913
I see.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.916
Did any civilians get hurt?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.837
No, sir. If that were the case,
I would have arrested all these men.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:20.263
So anyone who went to
the same school as you is your senior?

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:23.433
Stand up straight. Get your hands out.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.559
Hey.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.769
That's enough.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:29.480
Look at you defending your junior.

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:31.691
Maybe you should be on the same side then.

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:33.943
Stop complicating things
by choosing different sides.

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.945
Whatever. Are they all inside talking?

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.448
Yeah. Come smoke with me.
I have something to tell you.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:39.782
- Do you smoke?
- Yes.

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.576
- Don't smoke, you idiot.
- Let's go.

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:52.587
If my mom catches you smoking
near the crocks, she'll kill you.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.756
Oh. Oh.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:57.091
Why did you bring them all here?

00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:59.510
The Captain told me to. I had no choice.

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:02.972
This brings back old memories.

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.307
You remember those days?

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.310
Your dream was to become a novelist,
but you became a thug.

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:10.355
I used to get into fights all the time,
but I'm a cop today.

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:11.522
Life's unpredictable, huh?

00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:13.942
You want to switch jobs with me?

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.735
It wouldn't be a fair trade.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.447
Anyway, have you spoken to them yet?

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.496
I'm going to.

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.289
Just do it already.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:30.124
You made a decision. Don't hesitate.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:31.501
I'm counting on you.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:40.551
You brats.
I've known you since you were kids.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:41.928
I've watched you grow up.

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:45.556
Once a family starts fighting
for something,

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.891
they fight to the death.

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:48.434
That's how it's always been.

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:53.356
You should be on good terms
with each other, like brothers,

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:54.941
not cause trouble like this!

00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:01.155
The two of you,

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:02.782
stand up.

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:09.998
Shake hands.

00:13:14.043 --> 00:13:15.211
Go on.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.630
Is it that hard for you guys to apologize?

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:23.511
Fine then.
I'll make you shake hands myself.

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:32.061
Now say something nice to each other.

00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:37.900
Now!

00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:40.778
Sir,

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.448
I'm sorry...

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:46.909
for the trouble I caused.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.998
That's all right. I'm sorry too.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.094
Really? But you're amazing.

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:47.595
Won't you reconsider?

00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:51.891
I'm sorry.
I didn't expect to get so many applicants.

00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:54.352
I thought it would only be a few students.

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:58.022
I feel uncomfortable
teaching a lot of people at once.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.942
I guess I understand.

00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:02.026
Well...

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:04.487
could I get your autograph?

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:07.115
- Sorry?
- I subscribe to your channel.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:09.659
"Little Singing Room."

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:10.910
Really?

00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:13.913
- Here, please.
- I've never met a subscriber before.

00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:16.207
- Oh, my.
- I'm a big fan.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.416
Thank you.

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:43.442
You're right, sir.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:44.902
- Go on inside.
- Sir!

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:46.737
What took you so long?

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.406
I couldn't even wash my face.

00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:50.283
The heater broke down again.

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:53.286
I'm going to get
the whole thing fixed one day.

00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:57.165
- Changsoo.
- How have you been, sir?

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:58.416
I've been well.

00:15:58.499 --> 00:16:01.335
I hardly see you around anymore.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:03.671
Hello, sir. I'm Taehoon.

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:04.755
Right, Taehoon.

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:06.507
Boys, come over here.

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:09.427
Hey, Daegi. Let them go.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:10.970
- You come in with me.
- Yes, sir.

00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:15.683
Don't give him a hard time.

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:18.227
See you around.

00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:20.813
And stop all this fighting.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:22.273
- Good-bye, sir.
- Bye.

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:25.526
Sir, may I have
a cup of sweet coffee while I'm here?

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.778
Good-bye, sir. I'll see you at the office.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.995
Must be tough for you, huh?

00:16:56.807 --> 00:16:58.559
Damn it.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:02.563
- Uncle!
- Hey, Hyeonggeun!

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:03.814
Where'd you go this morning?

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.566
I went to draw at Daegyun's.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.026
Good job.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.362
How diligent. You're my role model.
Go on inside.

00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:10.780
Don't run.

00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:12.406
- I'm home.
- Hi.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.991
- Go wash your hands.
- Okay.

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:16.035
- Hey, help me with these.
- What is that?

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:17.119
They're so heavy.

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:20.289
It's kimchi.
One for your sister, and one for Kihong.

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:23.584
Just send one big portion to Seokhee.
Why a separate one for him?

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:26.545
This won't make them come over
and announce their marriage.

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:29.340
Stop talking so much and just do as I say.

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:31.467
Yes, ma'am. Roger that.

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:33.386
God, these are heavy!

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.054
How much do they weigh?

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:41.894
Listen, how's the search
for your older sister coming along?

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:47.066
I've asked some of my acquaintances,
but it's gonna take a while.

00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:48.192
That stupid girl.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:50.236
I get that she went into hiding
for what she did,

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.738
but she should at least be worried
about her son.

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:54.115
Not even a phone call from her.

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:57.743
She must be too ashamed to call.

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:00.997
Look at this.

00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:05.418
It's a reminder from the bank.

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:07.169
They even called two days ago.

00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:09.839
A reminder?

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:14.176
368 million won?

00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:19.807
What a mess
you've left us in, Seokkyung.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.060
Thanks to her,
we might end up going broke.

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:25.062
Who answered the call from the bank?

00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:29.150
Instant coffee is the best.
It's nice and sweet.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:31.569
Father, did you talk to the guys
from the bank?

00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:34.113
I'll handle that myself.
You stay out of it.

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:36.490
You know I can't do that.

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.993
And how would you possibly handle it?

00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:41.954
You know that junior of mine named Tick?

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:44.332
Yes, the loan shark, right?

00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:47.627
Yes. He's got a lot of connections.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.212
He knows a lot of people in banks.

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:53.299
I'm going to go with Stick
and talk to the branch manager in person.

00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:58.346
Seokcheol, your father and I
will take care of it. Don't worry.

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:01.932
Look, you can't just go threaten
a branch manager these days.

00:19:02.016 --> 00:19:03.351
You could get in serious trouble.

00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:04.727
They'll think you're robbers.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.980
I'm not going to threaten anyone.

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:11.692
I'm going to ask them if they can extend
the deadline for the payment.

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:13.944
I'll take care of it. Now, go away.

00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:15.946
It's all right.

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.032
Fine.

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:20.951
Bye.

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:36.092
SEOKHEE

00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:40.012
- I heard you have Mom's kimchi for me?
- Yeah.

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:41.847
And there's one for Kihong too?

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:43.474
Bring it over to my house.

00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:46.185
Hey, I'm not your kimchi deliveryman.

00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:50.147
- I'll swing by the hospital. Come take--
- I've told you not to come here.

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:52.108
Just drop it off at my place. Bye.

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.359
I'm--

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:55.486
Hello? Hey, Seokhee. Hey!

00:19:56.821 --> 00:20:00.199
What a brat!

00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:02.743
As if I'd let him bring the kimchi here!

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:04.912
Was that Seokcheol? What was it about?

00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:07.665
My mom's sending some kimchi for us.

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:09.291
He wanted to drop it off here.

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:11.752
You should've let him.
I'd finally be able to see my friend.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.546
Are you guys really friends?

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:17.049
I like everything about you
except the fact that you're his friend.

00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:22.596
Honey, why do you like my brother?
Other than the fact that you're friends.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.895
If not for him, I probably
wouldn't have gone to med school.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.025
Back in school, I got bullied a lot
because I was a small kid.

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:39.530
Seokcheol would beat up the bullies
and tell them not to mess with his friend.

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:42.408
Thanks to that,
I studied hard and became a doctor.

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:45.035
What about Byeongsoo?

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:48.414
Byeongsoo? He was a total loser in school.

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:51.876
I can't believe he's running around
trying to catch criminals these days.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.130
What are you doing after work?

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:01.844
Maybe I could come over to your place,
and we could have some wine?

00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:07.016
I have plans with a friend this evening.

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:10.478
That's okay.
I'll just wait for you at your place.

00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:12.605
Okay? Text me on your way back.

00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:15.816
- Don't take off your socks at my house.
- Okay.

00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:21.071
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:23.574
What?

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:24.992
What did you just say?

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:27.912
I want to quit.

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:31.916
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:33.667
It isn't sudden.

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:36.837
I've been thinking about it
for a while now.

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.339
I just didn't tell you.

00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:41.217
What on earth are you saying?

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:47.807
Hey, this isn't like any ordinary job.
You can't just quit when you want to.

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:53.103
Then,

00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:55.147
what should I do?

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:58.943
You want me to turn into Taehoon?

00:22:09.036 --> 00:22:13.290
Listen, boss,
I'm sorry to have to say this,

00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:17.253
but I don't intend
to be mistreated like that.

00:22:20.506 --> 00:22:21.632
Come on, man.

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:24.093
What's wrong with you?

00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:27.012
You know I have a lot of respect for you.

00:22:27.096 --> 00:22:30.558
You're younger than me,
but I respect you despite that.

00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:32.268
It's true, you punk.

00:22:32.893 --> 00:22:35.980
It's just that your timing's all wrong.

00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:39.525
The Chairman's already on edge
because of that bastard Taehoon.

00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:43.946
If I go up to him and say,
"Boss, Seokcheol wants to quit his job,"

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:45.364
what do you think he'll say?

00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:47.199
There's no way I can tell him that.

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:51.370
- Okay, then I'll tell him myself.
- Hey!

00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:53.664
Sit down.

00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:55.291
Sit back down, come on.

00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:56.375
Let's talk about it.

00:23:01.922 --> 00:23:03.048
This is exhausting.

00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:08.512
I've got it.

00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:13.142
Take care of that matter
with the third district first.

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:18.397
Once you do, I'll tell the Chairman
that we should let you go.

00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:21.734
It's more likely
he'll approve your resignation then.

00:23:22.443 --> 00:23:23.694
Even if he doesn't,

00:23:23.777 --> 00:23:26.030
I'll do everything I can
to help you leave.

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:31.994
You know it's always good to end something
on a positive note.

00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:34.246
Take care of the third district,

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.457
get an incentive
by securing the construction deal,

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.710
take your severance pay,
and then you can be on your way.

00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:41.378
What do you say? Okay?

00:23:42.838 --> 00:23:46.884
Come on, dude,
you need money to start a new life.

00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:50.512
If you leave empty-handed,
you'll just ruin your chances out there.

00:23:53.307 --> 00:23:56.018
This deal will be my last job. Okay?

00:23:56.101 --> 00:23:57.603
Absolutely. I won't stop you.

00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:02.316
Okay. I'll make sure to settle the deal.

00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:05.277
- On one condition.
- What is it?

00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:07.321
I won't resort to any violence.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.658
Everything will work out
if we just go with the flow.

00:24:10.741 --> 00:24:12.701
All right, fine.

00:24:14.078 --> 00:24:15.621
Fine, I get it.

00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:31.053
That's not how gangsters work,
you bastard.

00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:33.430
God, you're driving me nuts.

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:36.350
Hello?

00:24:36.976 --> 00:24:40.813
What? Why did you bring it here?
I told you to drop it off at the house!

00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:42.356
I'm already here.

00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:44.358
Meet me at the information desk.

00:24:44.441 --> 00:24:46.527
My car reeks of kimchi. I can't stand it.

00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:49.488
Hey, just put it in your car.

00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.073
Then my car's gonna smell too.

00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:53.117
Well,
it's your kimchi, after all.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.577
Oh, come on. I'm meeting a friend today.

00:24:55.661 --> 00:24:57.871
I can't drive around
with kimchi in my car.

00:24:57.955 --> 00:25:00.457
Your friend can help you carry it.

00:25:00.541 --> 00:25:03.168
- Who's the friend, by the way?
- It's no one you know.

00:25:03.252 --> 00:25:04.378
Fine, whatever.

00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:07.381
Come down and take your kimchi,
or I'll leave it here. Bye.

00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:16.306
These women have reduced me
to a kimchi deliveryman.

00:25:21.395 --> 00:25:22.980
Yeah, I'm just walking in now.

00:25:23.647 --> 00:25:24.815
Where are you?

00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:26.984
Me?

00:25:27.609 --> 00:25:28.610
I'm at...

00:25:41.707 --> 00:25:42.708
Seokcheol?

00:25:50.466 --> 00:25:51.675
Long time no see.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.761
Yeah...

00:25:55.721 --> 00:25:57.431
Long time no see.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.270
Ernest Hemingway once said,

00:26:04.313 --> 00:26:06.356
"The sun also rises,

00:26:07.691 --> 00:26:11.320
"and as long as the sun rises,
there's hope."

00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:16.283
My sun has risen again.

00:26:26.168 --> 00:26:28.337
Do you two know each other?

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.838
Us? We--

00:26:29.922 --> 00:26:33.675
We don't.
We just ran into each other a few times.

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:35.886
Yeah, you transferred so suddenly
in ninth grade.

00:26:35.969 --> 00:26:37.054
You must not know each other.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.933
Kang Miyoung,
this is my brother, Park Seokcheol.

00:26:41.725 --> 00:26:43.227
Hello, Seokcheol.

00:26:43.852 --> 00:26:44.853
Hi.

00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:48.565
I recently moved back to this neighborhood
with my mom.

00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:50.150
I see.

00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:52.611
So, how's life?

00:26:52.694 --> 00:26:54.071
She's pretty famous, you know?

00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:57.032
- She is?
- Yeah, she's really good at singing.

00:26:57.116 --> 00:27:00.369
People from other colleges would come
to hear her sing at college festivals.

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:03.497
I thought she'd become a pop star,
but oddly enough, she didn't.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.375
I'm not so good at all the dancing.

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:09.169
I have two left feet.

00:27:09.253 --> 00:27:11.588
You sure seem a bit stiff.

00:27:12.923 --> 00:27:15.425
- My body can't keep up.
- Look. This is her channel.

00:27:15.509 --> 00:27:16.802
Hey!

00:27:16.885 --> 00:27:18.095
"Little Singing Room."

00:27:18.846 --> 00:27:20.514
She's got a thousand subscribers.

00:27:20.597 --> 00:27:21.723
She's a celebrity.

00:27:21.807 --> 00:27:23.976
It's 900-something.
I haven't hit 1,000 yet.

00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:26.687
956 is almost as good as 1,000.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.022
- Yeah.
- This is amazing.

00:27:29.106 --> 00:27:30.691
Hey, you haven't liked her posts.

00:27:30.774 --> 00:27:33.360
She's your friend.
Show her some support, you brat.

00:27:33.443 --> 00:27:36.071
An agency's reached out to her
after watching her videos.

00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:38.407
- They asked her to audition for them.
- Whoa.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.284
I'm so nervous about it.

00:27:41.952 --> 00:27:43.537
There's no need to be nervous.

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:45.914
I'm sure you'll do great. Good luck.

00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:49.126
Thanks. I'll do my best.

00:28:01.096 --> 00:28:03.056
What's going on here?

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:06.560
What do you mean?
I'm just showing your friend some support.

00:28:28.123 --> 00:28:34.004

Seokcheol, close your eyes.

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:22.427
Why?

00:29:22.511 --> 00:29:25.222
Close your eyes
and focus on listening this time.

00:29:27.057 --> 00:29:28.058
Okay.

00:29:31.311 --> 00:29:32.938
I have a crush on you.

00:29:37.067 --> 00:29:39.236
You said you liked reading books.

00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:40.862
I haven't read it myself.

00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:43.532
I thought this had the best title of all.

00:29:45.826 --> 00:29:48.203
"The Sun Also Rises."

00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:55.127
I figured you didn't like me back.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.337
It's all right. I didn't get my hopes up.

00:29:57.421 --> 00:29:59.673
There are a lot of pretty girls
in high school--

00:29:59.756 --> 00:30:00.841
I like you.

00:30:02.592 --> 00:30:03.593
I've had...

00:30:05.095 --> 00:30:06.096
a crush on you too.

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:20.986
Miyoung!

00:30:34.374 --> 00:30:37.419
What a beautiful view!
Aren't you glad we came here?

00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:18.418
THE SUN ALSO RISES

00:31:24.174 --> 00:31:25.967
TO SEOKCHEOL
FROM M.Y.

00:31:33.266 --> 00:31:35.852
Uncle, could I sleep in here with you?

00:31:35.936 --> 00:31:39.314
Grandpa had a drink,
and now he's snoring loudly.

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:40.398
Sure, come in.

00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:46.863
There you go.

00:31:49.366 --> 00:31:50.534
Hyeonggeun.

00:31:51.451 --> 00:31:53.537
What do you think? Isn't she good?

00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:55.330
I don't know.

00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:57.332
What do you mean? Watch closely.

00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:59.417
She's a good singer and she's pretty.

00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:02.879
Yes, but my mom's prettier.

00:32:02.963 --> 00:32:05.632
What are you talking about?
She's way prettier than your mom.

00:32:05.715 --> 00:32:07.884
I don't think so.

00:32:07.968 --> 00:32:10.303
- Go sleep with Grandpa.
- No, I agree. She's prettier.

00:32:10.387 --> 00:32:12.764
There you go.
You should always tell the truth.

00:32:19.688 --> 00:32:21.314
- Uncle.
- Yes?

00:32:21.398 --> 00:32:24.067
Haven't you found my mom yet?

00:32:27.362 --> 00:32:28.697
Do you miss her a lot?

00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:30.282
Yes.

00:32:30.907 --> 00:32:34.077
But not a lot. Just a little.

00:32:35.162 --> 00:32:36.163
Be patient, buddy.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.457
I'll find your mom and bring her home.

00:32:39.541 --> 00:32:45.005
Grandma said
Mom's too scared of Grandpa to come home.

00:32:46.173 --> 00:32:49.593
Because if she gets caught,
he'll break her legs.

00:32:49.676 --> 00:32:53.305
No, I'm sure he didn't mean it.

00:32:54.014 --> 00:32:55.557
He wouldn't do that.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.350
Now try and get some sleep.

00:32:58.226 --> 00:32:59.477
I'll turn the lights off.

00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:20.290
Hello, my name is Kang Miyoung.

00:33:20.373 --> 00:33:23.293
I prefer singing my own compositions.

00:33:23.376 --> 00:33:26.171
I want to be a singer-songwriter someday.

00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:29.216
Today I'm going to sing you
a cover song I posted online.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:33.803
Come on.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.855
{\an8}YOU CAN DO IT, CHEER UP!

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.235
Here's 300,000 won.

00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:51.112
Thanks.

00:33:52.197 --> 00:33:53.782
Life is hard, isn't it?

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:57.661
Every month, I send 500,000 won
out of my paycheck to my family,

00:33:57.744 --> 00:33:59.329
I pay their utility bills,

00:33:59.913 --> 00:34:02.290
and pay my own rent too.

00:34:02.374 --> 00:34:06.503
If I want to buy myself a new outfit,
I need to save up for a whole year.

00:34:07.087 --> 00:34:10.257
Fortunately, people are clueless about it.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.591
Thanks to our good looks.

00:34:12.634 --> 00:34:15.637
So what if our clothes are cheap?
Our pretty faces make up for it.

00:34:16.596 --> 00:34:18.556
I'll pay you back soon.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.934
That's okay. Take your time.

00:34:21.017 --> 00:34:22.811
Good luck with your audition tomorrow.

00:34:23.395 --> 00:34:24.396
Let's eat.

00:34:48.461 --> 00:34:51.589
We rarely offer such an opportunity,
but we've seen your potential.

00:34:52.674 --> 00:34:54.551
Please relax, and take your time.

00:34:54.634 --> 00:34:56.344
Okay, thank you.

00:34:56.428 --> 00:34:57.762
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

00:34:58.305 --> 00:34:59.306
Let's begin.

00:35:15.322 --> 00:35:17.824
Oh. Check out her singing. She's great.

00:35:17.907 --> 00:35:19.534
- She is?
- Really?

00:35:35.425 --> 00:35:36.635
♪ I write ♪

00:35:52.942 --> 00:35:56.738
So, you're telling me
you can't sing in front of people?

00:35:57.864 --> 00:35:58.865
Yes.

00:35:58.948 --> 00:36:01.159
You need to have courage to be a singer.

00:36:01.242 --> 00:36:02.827
You can't shy away from people.

00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:06.289
I'm sorry. I'll try and work on it.

00:36:06.373 --> 00:36:08.625
Everyone in this industry works hard.

00:36:08.708 --> 00:36:10.168
They do their best.

00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:12.629
But they're not always willing to wait.

00:36:13.797 --> 00:36:15.256
Anyway, thanks for coming in.

00:36:15.799 --> 00:36:16.883
Thank you.

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:25.517
MYOUNGSAN HOSPITAL

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.810
What is it?

00:36:28.687 --> 00:36:29.896
Spit it out.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:32.399
You know...

00:36:32.982 --> 00:36:34.275
From the other day...

00:36:35.235 --> 00:36:36.820
That friend of yours...

00:36:37.278 --> 00:36:38.279
Miyoung...

00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:39.906
What about her?

00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:41.866
You came here to ask me for her number?

00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:44.160
What?

00:36:45.578 --> 00:36:48.248
How did you know? Did you read my mind?

00:36:48.832 --> 00:36:50.083
How very interesting.

00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:52.627
Miyoung asked me for your number too.

00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:53.712
Really?

00:36:54.838 --> 00:36:56.548
Well, did you give her my number?

00:36:58.091 --> 00:37:00.301
Do you have feelings for her? Be honest.

00:37:00.385 --> 00:37:03.388
Why? Is it wrong to have feelings for her?

00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:09.060
Miyoung's my friend, I care about her.
And she's had a tough life.

00:37:09.144 --> 00:37:11.688
She asked to meet me
because she wanted to borrow money.

00:37:11.771 --> 00:37:12.772
Borrow money?

00:37:13.523 --> 00:37:14.983
Is her family struggling?

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.653
Kind of, but it's amazing
how well she's dealing with it.

00:37:19.487 --> 00:37:21.072
So, did you lend her the money?

00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:22.824
Yeah, I lent her 300,000 won.

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:25.201
I know about her situation,
so I couldn't say no.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.203
Good job, little sister.

00:37:28.455 --> 00:37:29.956
What is her situation, though?

00:37:30.707 --> 00:37:32.375
That's none of your business.

00:37:33.168 --> 00:37:36.629
She's had terrible luck,
not to mention that sudden transfer.

00:37:36.713 --> 00:37:39.340
There were weird rumors about her
in school.

00:37:40.967 --> 00:37:42.761
What rumors?

00:37:42.844 --> 00:37:45.054
All you need to know
is that something bad happened.

00:37:45.597 --> 00:37:46.848
I'm busy. Bye.

00:37:47.849 --> 00:37:49.976
Hey, wait. Did you give her my number?

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:51.311
Hey, tell me before...

00:37:52.854 --> 00:37:55.440
That brat.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:10.330
Hi, Seokcheol. This is Miyoung.

00:38:20.882 --> 00:38:24.302
It was nice to meet you.
But we didn't get to catch up properly.

00:38:28.431 --> 00:38:29.557
Hi.

00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:32.977
{\an8}

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:39.901
It was nice meeting you too.

00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:03.132
- Shall we meet today?
- Would you like to meet?

00:39:16.563 --> 00:39:18.857
- Enjoy your drink.
- Thank you.

00:39:39.419 --> 00:39:41.170
- Would you like to order?
- What?

00:39:42.088 --> 00:39:43.089
Oh?

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:47.594
Do you work here?

00:39:55.602 --> 00:39:56.603
You look good.

00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:58.396
You too.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.109
You've somehow gotten cooler
over the years.

00:40:03.192 --> 00:40:04.986
- Come on, don't tease me.
- Really.

00:40:11.993 --> 00:40:13.369
I'm sorry.

00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:16.205
For leaving without telling you.

00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:19.959
I always regretted it.

00:40:20.793 --> 00:40:22.003
I shouldn't have done that.

00:40:24.172 --> 00:40:26.674
Well, it's all in the past now.

00:40:26.758 --> 00:40:30.178
I figured you must have had your reasons.

00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:32.555
I see.

00:40:33.848 --> 00:40:37.727
Despite what happened,
I thought about you a lot.

00:40:39.228 --> 00:40:41.898
I would wonder how you were doing,

00:40:42.482 --> 00:40:46.861
and whether we'd ever get to meet again.

00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:48.947
I actually thought about you...

00:40:50.323 --> 00:40:51.407
a lot too.

00:40:52.492 --> 00:40:55.912
I would wonder how you were,
if you were doing what you wanted,

00:40:56.412 --> 00:41:02.293
and if we'd ever get to meet again,
even once, you know.

00:41:04.879 --> 00:41:07.924
I am doing what I want in life.

00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:09.801
It's just not working out well.

00:41:11.761 --> 00:41:14.847
Oh, wait. How did the audition go?

00:41:14.931 --> 00:41:16.307
Uh...

00:41:18.768 --> 00:41:19.769
I didn't make it.

00:41:19.852 --> 00:41:22.271
Huh? Really? Why?

00:41:22.355 --> 00:41:23.356
Goodness.

00:41:24.399 --> 00:41:27.944
The truth is,
I can't sing in front of people.

00:41:28.027 --> 00:41:30.738
When someone's watching me...

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.867
I panic and find it hard to breathe.

00:41:35.827 --> 00:41:37.954
I'm too shy.
It's like a disease, you know.

00:41:38.705 --> 00:41:41.416
I can sing just fine when I'm alone,
but strangely...

00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:44.836
I think it's better
when I play the piano, though.

00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:48.256
It eases my mind.

00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:51.968
It's okay. Happens to me all the time.

00:41:54.512 --> 00:41:55.638
Oh.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.892
I better get going.
I'll miss the bus.

00:42:01.102 --> 00:42:02.854
Where are you going? Let me drive you.

00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:04.272
Oh, just the bus stop.

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:06.024
It's okay. I'm old enough to drive now.

00:42:06.107 --> 00:42:08.151
- Let me drive you.
- It's far.

00:42:09.235 --> 00:42:11.195
- No problem.
- You sure? It's very far.

00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:32.091
What is it?

00:42:32.633 --> 00:42:34.844
I always take the bus,

00:42:34.927 --> 00:42:37.722
so you driving me today
makes it feel like a road trip.

00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:38.931
I love it.

00:42:40.183 --> 00:42:41.184
Me too.

00:42:41.768 --> 00:42:43.269
I'm mostly driving by myself,

00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:45.563
so it's nice to be with someone.

00:42:46.773 --> 00:42:48.399
Shall we carpool from now on?

00:43:16.719 --> 00:43:17.720
A nursing home?

00:43:18.846 --> 00:43:20.139
I come here to visit my mom.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:22.475
You remember my mom, right?

00:43:23.059 --> 00:43:25.478
Of course. Does she live here?

00:43:26.062 --> 00:43:28.564
She's unwell, so I had to put her up here.

00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:34.278
Do you mind if I come with you?
I'd like to say hello to her.

00:43:42.578 --> 00:43:45.790
Why didn't you answer my calls, Mom?
I was so worried.

00:43:45.873 --> 00:43:46.958
You called me?

00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:49.544
See? You got missed calls from me,
your daughter.

00:43:49.627 --> 00:43:50.837
You're right.

00:43:51.546 --> 00:43:54.882
My daughter's called me so many times.

00:43:55.383 --> 00:43:59.804
When you get a missed call next time,
click this icon and call me back, okay?

00:43:59.887 --> 00:44:01.681
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

00:44:02.557 --> 00:44:04.475
Hello, ma'am.

00:44:04.559 --> 00:44:05.810
Do you remember me?

00:44:06.978 --> 00:44:09.689
Do you know Miyoung's friend Seokhee?
I'm her older brother.

00:44:12.775 --> 00:44:14.861
Don't you remember him? That's Seokcheol.

00:44:14.944 --> 00:44:16.904
He used to visit your gimbap place often.

00:44:16.988 --> 00:44:17.989
Yeah.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.575
You're Mr. Broom!

00:44:21.617 --> 00:44:23.995
Look at you all grown up!

00:44:24.078 --> 00:44:27.290
Mom, his name is Seokcheol, not Broom.

00:44:27.373 --> 00:44:30.168
- You don't call someone a broom.
- Oh!

00:44:30.918 --> 00:44:33.963
Ma'am, you're right. I am Mr. Broom!

00:44:34.046 --> 00:44:36.757
I used to hang around your store
hoping to see Miyoung,

00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:39.051
and you'd chase me away with a broom.

00:44:40.052 --> 00:44:41.304
Really?

00:44:41.387 --> 00:44:43.222
- Yeah.
- Are you serious?

00:44:43.306 --> 00:44:45.474
Ma'am, your memory is great.

00:44:48.603 --> 00:44:49.645
Really.

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:52.773
No, Mom, I'm sorry.

00:44:52.857 --> 00:44:55.985
I can't take you home with me today,
I'm sorry.

00:44:56.652 --> 00:44:59.280
But I want to go home, Miyoung.

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:00.865
I know, I'd like that too.

00:45:00.948 --> 00:45:04.202
But I can't leave you there alone
when I go to work.

00:45:04.285 --> 00:45:07.121
What if you get lost again like that day?

00:45:07.205 --> 00:45:10.249
I don't care. I don't want to stay here.

00:45:10.333 --> 00:45:11.667
Hang in there, okay?

00:45:11.751 --> 00:45:14.587
I'll work really hard
and take you home soon.

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:16.505
Just a little longer.

00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:19.800
Just a little longer, I'm sorry.
Please hang in there.

00:45:19.884 --> 00:45:21.469
I'm sorry.

00:45:22.303 --> 00:45:25.223
I'm sorry.

00:45:25.306 --> 00:45:28.351
I'm sorry, okay? I really am.

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:33.731
ORTHOPEDIC CENTER

00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:55.086
- Go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.
- Shall I order for you?

00:45:55.169 --> 00:45:57.255
- An iced Americano, please.
- Okay.

00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:03.970
- I have an appointment today.
- May I have your name, please?

00:46:04.053 --> 00:46:06.097
- Go Jeongnim.
- Pardon me?

00:46:06.806 --> 00:46:08.266
Go Jeongnim.

00:46:10.017 --> 00:46:11.269
"Go Jeongnim."

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:13.938
It has to be her.

00:46:14.021 --> 00:46:15.439
Seokkyung's friend.

00:46:24.073 --> 00:46:25.491
- Take good care of her.
- Sure.

00:46:26.284 --> 00:46:27.868
Mom, I have to go now.

00:46:29.578 --> 00:46:30.997
Clap your hands.

00:46:33.749 --> 00:46:37.545
- Come back soon.
- I will. You take care.

00:46:41.882 --> 00:46:43.092
I'll come see you too, ma'am.

00:46:44.427 --> 00:46:45.428
Did you hear him?

00:46:47.847 --> 00:46:49.682
Bye, Mom. I'll see you soon.

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.810
Bye, Mom.

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:56.897
Bye.

00:47:09.327 --> 00:47:11.662
Thanks... Mr. Broom.

00:47:20.254 --> 00:47:21.547
Miyoung.

00:47:22.423 --> 00:47:24.300
- Let's go.
- Where?

00:47:25.092 --> 00:47:26.510
- Let's sing.
- What?

00:47:27.178 --> 00:47:28.512
Come with me.

00:47:28.596 --> 00:47:29.638
Why?

00:47:31.182 --> 00:47:32.767
SARANGBANG PROGRAM ROOM

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.226
Hello, dear elders.

00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:37.146
May I have your attention, please?

00:47:37.229 --> 00:47:39.648
Seokcheol, I really can't do it.

00:47:39.732 --> 00:47:41.025
It's okay, Miyoung.

00:47:41.108 --> 00:47:43.319
Look at them, they don't care about us.

00:47:45.279 --> 00:47:47.114
All right, everyone. Listen up...

00:47:48.199 --> 00:47:50.201
Okay, let's say you're paying attention.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:54.372
Yes. Thank you, ma'am.

00:47:54.455 --> 00:47:57.583
We've got a special program for you today.

00:47:57.666 --> 00:47:59.794
We've invited someone over...

00:48:00.461 --> 00:48:03.297
who is soon going to be
a famous singer in this country.

00:48:03.381 --> 00:48:05.466
Let's give her a warm welcome.

00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:07.510
Ms. Kang Miyoung!

00:48:07.593 --> 00:48:09.011
A round of applause for her!

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.930
Applause, please.

00:48:11.013 --> 00:48:13.724
I really can't sing
in front of so many people.

00:48:13.808 --> 00:48:16.685
Miyoung, imagine you're singing
just for me.

00:48:16.769 --> 00:48:18.145
Give it a shot, okay?

00:49:16.871 --> 00:49:19.165
That's insane. Hey, film it.

Do you see this here?

00:51:23.581 --> 00:51:26.166
Do you see how narrow it is
compared to the others?

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.839
The fluid is sticking
to this fibrous ring here.

00:51:32.673 --> 00:51:35.175
It must be quite painful.

00:51:35.259 --> 00:51:37.136
- Do you have trouble walking?
- Yes.

00:51:37.219 --> 00:51:39.346
- I'll get a wheelchair for you.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:42.600
Do you have to bend down or stay seated
for a long time at work?

00:51:45.185 --> 00:51:47.396
Well...

00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:48.939
I wouldn't call it work.

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:51.483
But, yeah, I guess you could say that.

00:51:51.567 --> 00:51:54.320
Don't you often sit cross-legged
on the floor?

00:51:54.403 --> 00:51:57.448
I bet you even bend down
and look at something like this.

00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.241
How do you know?

00:52:00.451 --> 00:52:02.786
- Jeongnim, don't you remember me?
- Who...

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.663
- Who is she?
- It's Seokhee.

00:52:04.747 --> 00:52:06.582
Seokkyung's younger sister.

00:52:06.665 --> 00:52:08.667
- You really don't remember me?
- Do you know her?

00:52:09.209 --> 00:52:11.337
She's my sister's high school friend.

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.547
- They're best friends.
- Oh, really?

00:52:19.678 --> 00:52:22.348
Oh, Seokhee. Yes, I remember you.

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:24.558
Easy, easy, easy!

00:52:24.642 --> 00:52:26.644
Be careful!

00:52:29.271 --> 00:52:32.191
I bet you're a terrible driver too.

00:52:32.274 --> 00:52:33.692
Do you know this saying:

00:52:33.776 --> 00:52:36.278
"You encounter your enemy's friend
at the worst place and time"?

00:52:36.362 --> 00:52:39.239
You just made that up,
didn't you?

00:52:39.323 --> 00:52:41.575
What's all this about "an enemy's friend"?

00:52:41.659 --> 00:52:44.119
Seokkyung ran away from home,
so she's my enemy.

00:52:44.203 --> 00:52:45.663
And you're her friend.

00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:48.832
Where is she?

00:52:53.212 --> 00:52:55.214
I have no idea where she is.

00:52:56.256 --> 00:52:57.508
I know you do.

00:52:57.591 --> 00:53:00.052
You two are always
getting into trouble together.

00:53:00.135 --> 00:53:02.429
Do you really have to be so mean to me?

00:53:02.513 --> 00:53:05.140
We haven't seen each other
in such a long time.

00:53:05.224 --> 00:53:06.517
You think I'm mean?

00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:09.812
You remember my brother,
the hot-tempered thug?

00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:11.522
Want me to call him?

00:53:15.317 --> 00:53:17.361
Then tell me where Park Seokkyung is.

00:53:33.585 --> 00:53:35.754
- Is this it?
- Yes, up there.

00:53:35.838 --> 00:53:37.131
Oh, okay.

00:53:37.798 --> 00:53:39.007
Thanks for today.

00:53:39.633 --> 00:53:40.926
Don't mention it.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.638
Get home safe. I'll call you soon.

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.308
Okay. Go on inside.

00:53:49.017 --> 00:53:50.018
Bye.

00:54:12.124 --> 00:54:14.168
SEOKHEE

00:54:14.626 --> 00:54:17.129
Yeah, what is it?

00:54:18.756 --> 00:54:19.757
What the...

00:54:21.008 --> 00:54:22.342
Why are you laughing?

00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:26.096
You remember Seokkyung's friend, Jeongnim?

00:54:26.972 --> 00:54:28.891
Jeongnim...

00:54:29.725 --> 00:54:30.851
Ah, yes, the gambler.

00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:33.771
Always came over to play cards
at Seokkyung's hair salon.

00:54:33.854 --> 00:54:38.066
Yeah. She came to the hospital today.
She's been admitted for a herniated disc.

00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:40.068
- Really?
- Yes.

00:54:40.861 --> 00:54:44.781
I intimidated her into telling me
where Seokkyung is.

00:54:44.865 --> 00:54:46.283
Where are you? I'm coming over.

00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:48.410
Got it.

00:54:49.661 --> 00:54:50.954
I'll be there soon.

00:54:57.669 --> 00:54:59.379
- Let's go!
- What's her current location?

00:54:59.463 --> 00:55:00.756
It's on the app. Follow the map.

00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:02.257
- Okay.
- Let's go.

00:55:11.725 --> 00:55:13.936
Are you sure it's safe
for us to go by ourselves?

00:55:14.019 --> 00:55:16.522
There might be scary people
at that gambling place.

00:55:17.439 --> 00:55:19.316
You still have that baseball bat
in the trunk?

00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:22.528
What exactly
are you going to do with it?

00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:25.405
Don't try to be clever.
Just stay put, and I'll take care of it.

00:55:25.906 --> 00:55:28.909
On some days
it's good to have a thug for a brother.

00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:32.871
Sure, go ahead and take advantage of it.

00:55:47.553 --> 00:55:48.554
That must be it.

00:55:48.637 --> 00:55:51.473
It might seem like a club,
but it's actually a gambling house.

00:55:52.266 --> 00:55:54.518
There should be a guard
in a car somewhere.

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.770
Over there. I think that's him.

00:55:57.354 --> 00:55:59.273
I think there'll be thugs
inside the place too.

00:56:01.483 --> 00:56:02.484
Let's go in.

00:56:02.568 --> 00:56:04.653
You're not going anywhere. It's dangerous.

00:56:04.736 --> 00:56:05.737
Then what do we do?

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:11.285
Try to lure that guard out of his car.

00:56:11.368 --> 00:56:12.703
Think you can do it?

00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:14.329
Okay.

00:56:14.955 --> 00:56:16.832
Be careful.
Don't do anything more than that.

00:56:16.915 --> 00:56:17.916
Yeah, okay.

00:56:32.681 --> 00:56:33.890
What do you want?

00:56:33.974 --> 00:56:35.100
I came to gamble.

00:56:35.183 --> 00:56:36.184
Gamble?

00:56:37.185 --> 00:56:38.604
How did you find this place?

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:41.398
- Jeongnim told me about it.
- Oh.

00:56:42.816 --> 00:56:44.651
Where is she? Are you here alone?

00:56:44.735 --> 00:56:46.820
Uh, she told me to go inside
and wait for her.

00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:53.577
You must be eager to get in.

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:54.703
I got you.

00:56:54.786 --> 00:56:56.288
Just a sec.

00:56:58.332 --> 00:57:00.959
All right. We have a customer coming in.
Do you copy?

00:57:01.585 --> 00:57:03.462
All right.

00:57:06.006 --> 00:57:07.007
Come on in.

00:57:08.383 --> 00:57:11.053
Tell them it's two customers.

00:57:19.311 --> 00:57:22.564
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
You heard the cuckoo.

00:57:22.648 --> 00:57:25.442
Time to hand over my commission.
Have two chips ready, please.

00:57:27.486 --> 00:57:28.904
Get rich.

00:57:29.613 --> 00:57:32.324
Could you get us a new ashtray?

00:57:32.407 --> 00:57:33.950
Here's a tip for you.

00:57:34.034 --> 00:57:36.662
My gosh. Thank you so much.

00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:39.831
Mr. Hwang,
I bet Lady Luck will be on your side.

00:57:39.915 --> 00:57:41.792
What a generous man you are.

00:57:41.875 --> 00:57:45.212
- Here, have a tip from me too.
- Gee, thank you.

00:57:46.004 --> 00:57:47.005
Two each, please.

00:57:53.512 --> 00:57:56.473
I'm sorry. Please continue. Sorry.

00:57:58.892 --> 00:57:59.893
Seokkyung.

00:58:04.356 --> 00:58:05.607
What's going on?

00:58:07.192 --> 00:58:09.361
Seokhee.

00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:11.154
Seokcheol.

00:58:11.238 --> 00:58:12.823
Long time no see.

00:58:12.906 --> 00:58:15.283
- Yeah.
- How could you hide in a place like this?

00:58:15.367 --> 00:58:17.786
- Let's go. This is embarrassing.
- Go where?

00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:20.080
- Come on. It's embarrassing.
- How did you know I was here?

00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:22.916
- That's not important. Come on.
- Let go of my arm, Seokhee.

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.209
Wait, let's talk...

00:58:26.044 --> 00:58:28.463
- Sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

00:58:28.547 --> 00:58:30.716
Ashtray seems to have loan sharks
chasing her again.

00:58:30.799 --> 00:58:32.676
Seems like it.

00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:38.515
I told you to come along quietly.
Get up. Let's go.

00:58:38.598 --> 00:58:39.975
Seokcheol, wait.

00:58:40.559 --> 00:58:42.144
Let's go. Are you okay?

00:58:42.227 --> 00:58:43.687
- I'm fine.
- Hurry up.

00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:45.564
Who are you, mister?

00:58:46.064 --> 00:58:48.358
I'm her brother. I came to take her home.

00:58:48.817 --> 00:58:50.235
What are you saying, punk?

00:58:50.318 --> 00:58:53.905
Obong, please don't.
You don't want any trouble, believe me.

00:58:53.989 --> 00:58:56.116
He's my little brother.

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:58.952
Seokcheol, don't do anything,
or I'll get mad!

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:00.036
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.121
Ashtray.

00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:04.291
Are they really
your little brother and sister?

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:05.375
Yes, ma'am.

00:59:05.459 --> 00:59:06.835
- Hey, lady.
- Hey.

00:59:06.918 --> 00:59:08.420
- Don't call her "Ashtray."
- Calm down.

00:59:08.503 --> 00:59:09.755
Where are your manners?

00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:13.258
Don't disrespect me. I'll beat you up.

00:59:13.341 --> 00:59:14.801
- No.
- No, ma'am.

00:59:14.885 --> 00:59:17.137
They're my little siblings.
They don't know any better.

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:18.680
Seokhee, my name is Ashtray now.

00:59:18.764 --> 00:59:21.183
- They're my siblings, ma'am.
- Get out of my way!

00:59:23.435 --> 00:59:24.644
How dare you push my sister!

00:59:24.728 --> 00:59:26.730
Seokhee!

00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:50.337
- Ah!
- Brat!

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:57.886
You nasty little--

01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:24.412
You people don't know
who you're messing with.

01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:31.378
- Kill her!
- Rip her to shreds!

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:55.151
Hey, stop, stop!

01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:57.153
It hurts!

01:00:57.237 --> 01:00:58.655
Seokhee!

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:16.172
Seokhee!

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.307
Seokkyung!
