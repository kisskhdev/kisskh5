- What the...
- I'm sorry.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.476
Miss, you can't just cut
to the front of the line.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.228
I'm in a huge hurry here.
Can't you help me out?

00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:22.272
Okay, I'm gonna have to have you
get back in line. They're all in a hurry.

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:23.565
Come on, please!

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:28.862
Could you just help me out this once?
Please?

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:32.241
Uh, you can let her go first. It's fine.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.124
Seoul! Seoul!

"WELCOME
SEOUL BOUND"

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:43.669
- Last bus to Seoul!
- Yeosu.

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:45.170
This is the last bus to Seoul!

00:00:45.254 --> 00:00:47.172
- Please get on!
- Yeah, I see it.

00:00:47.256 --> 00:00:48.966
- Bus to Yeosu departing soon!
- Last bus to Seoul!

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.176
Last bus to Seoul!
Please get on now!

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:55.555
Yeosu! Yeosu!

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.856
Check over there.

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:13.824
- Excuse you.
- Pardon.

00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:34.469
This bitch, seriously...

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.728
Where the fuck are you?

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:54.740
Here, you can, uh... you can
put this on. Earlier, you're the one who--

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:58.201
- We're gonna take off now!
- Fine. I'll get off.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.664
Shit!

00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:07.044
- Sir, you really can't be doing--
- Shut the fuck up.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.172
He's gone.

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:11.798
This bus is leaving!

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.593
I appreciate it.

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:30.776
Hey! Buddy, open the door!

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:35.072
This fucking bitch is putting us

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.865
through the damn ringer
with all this bullshit.

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:38.075
I'm fucking soaked.

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:40.243
Huh? Yeah?

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:43.538
Come here.

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:47.459
I said come here, bitch!

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.526
{\an8}- Good evening. Hi, sir.
Evening.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.153
{\an8}- Please head inside.
This is it.

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:58.530
{\an8}Hey, stop!

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.241
{\an8}- I'll get that for you.
Finally, we're here.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:02.325
{\an8}Yeah, of course.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.744
{\an8}- Don't leave that in the car.
Hello there. Evening, Mr. Lee.

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.538
{\an8}- You been all right?
Yes.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.540
{\an8}- Right this way, sir.
You guys are here early.

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:10.083
{\an8}- How are you?
Yeah, hi. Let's head inside.

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:11.585
{\an8}- Go on in.
All right.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:14.546
{\an8}Thank you again, Mrs. Yang,
for inviting us tonight.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.715
{\an8}Mr. Lee, you came dressed to impress.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.425
{\an8}Your business trip to China, how was it?

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:20.427
{\an8}It was great.
In fact, I have this for you.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.012
{\an8}Wild ginseng from a cultivator there.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.263
{\an8}Rare and one of a kind.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.599
{\an8}This means so much.

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.642
You should go inside,

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.770
- and see the chairman. He's there.
- Yes. Of course.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.398
Am I the only one
who thinks it's off? We should check.

00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:35.192
- I'll look into it right away, sir.
- Look at that.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.068
- You should.
- It seems like everyone's here already.

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:38.945
Oh, good evening, sir.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.782
Mr. Park.
Did I hear you talking about work?

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:44.159
Gotta at least pretend
that we're working

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:46.369
to stay on your husband's good side.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:49.372
Go ahead downstairs. Forget about work.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:52.459
- All righty, then. Let's head inside.
- Yeah, okay.

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:55.879
Evening. We're all here,
so let's head down together.

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.882
- Yes, sir.
- All right. Shall we? Let's go.

00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:06.389
Hey, put the guests' jackets
in the closet.

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.600
- Why are they just lying around?
- Yes, ma'am.

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:12.437
Don't worry about
serving the dishes too quickly.

00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.272
- And not too hot, okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:21.363
- Hello there.
- Oh, hello.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:24.282
- Enjoy the food. I'll call you down later.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:25.617
And the girls?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.453
- Uh, they should be here soon.
- Okay.

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:30.789
- Wow!
- This place is swanky!

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:32.749
- All right, this way.
- Lift, ladies.

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:34.501
- Don't drag your skirts.
- Right this way.

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.214
Be sure to watch your step, okay, girls?

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:42.133
- Look at this place!
- Oh, wow.

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:43.760
Uh, please wait here for a moment.

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:45.470
- It's beautiful.
- Lovely.

00:05:45.554 --> 00:05:48.223
- Madam Go, hi.
- Thank you for having us here.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:49.891
Which one's the prettiest?

00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:51.476
This one right here.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.561
Oh.

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:55.856
- You, sit next to the chairman.
- Okay!

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.233
- Right this way.
- Okay.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.569
- Let's go, girls.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:03.238
- Make sure you hold up your skirts.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:07.868
- Hello. Good evening.
- Oh, wow!

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:10.871
- Hello!
- Nice to meet you.

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:16.334
All right. Go ahead and sit down, girls.

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:17.961
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay!

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.423
And you can sit right here.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:24.217
- Hello.
- How are you?

00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:25.844
All right, all right.

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:29.556
Loosen your belts and forget
about work tonight, okay?

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.143
If anyone walks out of here
steady on their feet,

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.855
I'm gonna take that as a sign
that I wasn't a very good host.

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:39.024
Let's dig in!

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.735
In that case,
I gotta take off my belt, don't I?

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:47.741
Come on, girls. Hurry and get
these gentlemen their drinks.

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:50.076
- Okay!
- All right! Okay.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.746
For the chairman, no alcohol.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.414
Given his age now, he has to be careful.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:56.207
Oh. I'm sorry.

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:57.792
I guess my mind's still young,

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:02.172
but my body insists
on reminding me I'm not. What can I do?

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:04.424
How about a cup of water?

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:05.717
Of course, sir.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.844
Probably have a good piss tonight,
won't I?

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:12.724
Okay, on that note,
everyone have a great time tonight.

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.100
Yes, ma'am.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:16.645
- Thank you very much. Excuse me, then.
- All right. Yeah.

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.190
All right, Chairman Cheon,
how about a toast?

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.566
Oh, sure.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:25.445
A toast to Heungbaek's
continued prosperity and rise

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.405
and national contribution.

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:31.576
- Kanpai!
- Kanpai!

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:40.168
Man, just look at that color.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.712
This beauty's one of a kind.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:44.047
Good stuff, isn't it?

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:45.882
It's better than that.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.927
This here is great, the best of the best.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.138
We're gonna need a lot of
basins. Is this really all we got?

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.474
This is all we've got.
What do you wanna do?

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:55.975
We can buy more in Mokpo.

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:59.437
No, there's a marine store here.
Just give me the money and I'll get it.

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:04.025
Six, seven, eight, nine, twenty.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.902
In total, we've got 27.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.529
Eleven of the celadon,

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.573
11 of the porcelain,
and plates, we got five of 'em.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.617
- Mmm.
- Check for yourselves too.

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:15.954
When you're done,
sign with your thumbprint, okay?

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:19.124
What is it?

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:23.920
Hey, listen. Let me have half.

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:27.340
You already know
I can sell them for the right price.

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:35.515
So what's the woman promising you?

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.560
- You can tell me.
- How much do you think you can get?

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.480
I can get 500
to a million apiece for those.

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.315
You'll get 300.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.651
Hey, careful with that.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:50.321
Come on, I heard that
some pieces sell for over 30 million.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:53.533
That's all bullshit, don't you know that?

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:54.993
Thirty mil is a national treasure.

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.953
How many of those will we find?

00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.956
And we'll all get arrested
if we screw up here.

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:04.836
Best you'll get is a million won.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.213
I'm the expert, here. You know that.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:09.007
How big of a deposit can you put down?

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:11.092
Ten million won.

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:13.678
Hey, Tiger, look at this.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:16.848
That's not good enough.
Don't you see how many guys I have here?

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:22.062
Thirty mil, take it or leave it.

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.652
When do you need it?

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.281
Right now. We're outta time here.

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:39.537
Fine.

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:41.331
Oh, and also...

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:46.419
When you come by next,
bring the fake ones you cooked up, okay?

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:01.851
What is it?

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.564
Hey, come and help me for a sec.

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:08.608
Where are we going?

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:10.860
Beolgu. He's just lyin' there.

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.196
We need to get him to a doctor.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:16.366
Cause if he bites it here,
we're all totally fucked.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.326
- Right now?
- Yeah, now.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:20.745
Let's get goin'.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.301
Hey, kid.

00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:37.428
You okay?

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:40.765
Huh?

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.977
You doin' all right?

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.146
Think you can walk?

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.190
Let's get you up.

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:50.400
Help lift.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:53.361
- Right.
- Here we go.

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:58.867
Listen, bud, we're gonna go
to the doctor's now.

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:03.079
I need you to pull yourself together.

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:05.498

First of all, I would like to thank
everyone so much for coming tonight.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.010
You're the reason Heungbaek is
what it is today.

After all you've done for us tonight,
I don't even know what to say.

Except just thank you.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:56.317
Thank you so much for inviting us
to your beautiful home.

And I also have another surprise
waiting for you all.

I've invited someone

- A singer?

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:08.371
We're ready for you now!

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:16.129
Oh, my gosh!

- Sir. Guess who's here.
- Mmm?

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:30.560
- Can you believe it? Hyeon In!
- Huh?

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:32.562
There's quite a stir!

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:33.646

- Wow! Well, the pleasure's all mine.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:44.115

I gotta take a break.

What?

00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:48.424
I'll handle it. You should head on in.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.760
What do you mean? The boat's right there.

00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:53.179
Just look at him, man.

00:16:53.262 --> 00:16:56.307
He's barely responsive.
He's startin' to stink.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.808
He's as good as dead.

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:02.188
- I'll make it quick.
- Wait, what are you saying?

00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:03.564
We can't just kill the guy.

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:05.316
Tide's goin' out soon,

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:07.777
if we leave him over there,
he'll wash away.

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:13.157
Hey, he's up.
That'll make things harder. Shit.

00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:16.410
I'll just crack his head with a rock
and the tide'll take care of the rest.

00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:18.037
- Oh, yeah.
- Wait, hey, hey. No, hold up.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.123
Wait a second. Can't we just let him go?

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.251
Lettin' him go would be
a huge mistake, dumbass.

00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:25.127
What if he runs and tells everyone?

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:27.380
- Just drop it.
- Hey! Get off!

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:29.799
- I said get the fuck off!
- Stop! What the fuck?

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.760
What the hell? He's runnin' away.

00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:34.262
Damn it.

00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:36.097
Hey! Hey, come back here!

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.390
Stop!

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:40.476
- Let go of me! What are you--
- Just let me go! Fuck!

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.395
What are you gonna do
if he squeals to the police?

00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:44.730
What then? Huh?
He could screw up everything!

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:48.526
He's still alive, damn it!
We can't toss him, you asshole. Fuck this!

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:52.405
Hey! Hey, don't run!

It's dangerous!

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.802

- You don't have to run from us!

00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:17.847
- Ah, shit.
- Son of a bitch.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.807
Stop, you idiot!

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:24.103
Damn it! I'm not going to hurt you!

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:30.192
Stop!

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.030
Come back!

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:37.491
Beolgu! I'm not trying to kill you!

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.953
Just let him go, man.
What are you doin' in there?

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:43.456
Hey! Hey!

00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:50.379
You're gonna die!

00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:58.387

Oh, great, what now?

00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:22.662
- Wait!
- Fucking asshole.

00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:24.372
Ah, shit.

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.001
Fuck off!

00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:31.045
Hey, Beolgu!

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:35.966
I'll kill you, you fucking piece of shit.

00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:42.181
Damn. What the fuck?

00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:48.479
Look at this mess.
You just had to make things harder.

00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:56.570
Taesan.

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:01.617
I'm sorry.

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.955
Please. Please. I'm--

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:10.418
Yeah, I hear you.

00:20:47.121 --> 00:20:48.289
Hey, what's going on?

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:55.755
What's that? Is that Taesan?

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.340
Is he swimming in the middle of the night?

00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:01.844
- Hey.
- Huh?

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:04.013
I gotta tell you something.

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:05.097
Oh, yeah?

00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:07.183
Let's go inside.

00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:12.730
What is it?

00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:26.118
Where have you been?

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:28.913
You got a light?

00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:30.956
You know I don't smoke.

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:34.126
Ah, fuck, they're all wet. Shit.

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:37.505
Did you take care of Beolgu?

00:21:44.178 --> 00:21:46.847
Listen, I know we agreed
to split it equally.

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:48.349
That's not gonna cut it, though.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.727
I mean, I'm the one doin'
all the dirty work.

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:54.897
It's just not fair.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.108
Beolgu's share? I'll take that too.

00:22:20.798 --> 00:22:22.091
So what are you doing here?

00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:30.891
I came all this way
'cause I thought I should apologize.

00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:34.478
Apologize?

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:38.023
The thing is, I lied to you.

00:22:39.775 --> 00:22:43.529
I was never pregnant.
So you don't have to worry.

00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:49.702
You're not pregnant?

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:54.540
I guess your uncle
didn't tell you about it.

00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:59.295
Nothin' ever happened between us.

00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:02.423
You were too drunk to even attempt
to do anything that night.

00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:06.093
So don't worry about it anymore.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:14.518
Why tell me, though?

00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:19.982
Uh, you could've just kept up the lie.

00:23:24.028 --> 00:23:26.405
I guess I'm no good
at fooling folks, you know?

00:23:36.123 --> 00:23:39.293
Hey, thanks... for earlier.

00:23:41.045 --> 00:23:42.671
If it weren't for you, I would've...

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.260
What made the two of you fight like that?

00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:52.473
I don't know, just stuff.

00:23:52.556 --> 00:23:54.058
You think he's...

00:23:55.935 --> 00:23:57.561
You think he's okay?

00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:05.361
You must be tired.
You should stay the night.

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:08.697
I should get back.

00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:10.741
My boss will kill me
if I'm not there tomorrow.

00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:13.077
How are you gonna do that?
It's night. There's no boats.

00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:17.957
Sleep here and go back
in the morning, okay?

00:24:31.303 --> 00:24:34.306
Listen,
I'll take care of everything, okay?

00:24:34.807 --> 00:24:38.143
So don't worry about a thing. I promise.

00:24:40.813 --> 00:24:43.816
Everything's gonna be fine, all right?

00:25:05.546 --> 00:25:06.922
Hey, man.

00:25:08.424 --> 00:25:11.260
- I said hey!
- Hey, what the hell, guy?

00:25:11.927 --> 00:25:13.846
What do you want? Just be quiet.

00:25:13.929 --> 00:25:16.724
I'm wasting so much time
here with this shit.

00:25:16.807 --> 00:25:18.600
Oh, really?
Should I get you some work, then?

00:25:19.393 --> 00:25:20.853
If you just let me out,

00:25:20.936 --> 00:25:23.230
I'll find the guy I need
and then be outta your hair.

00:25:23.313 --> 00:25:25.649
Not likely to happen, you fucking gorilla.

00:25:25.733 --> 00:25:28.819
Well, I could just rip you apart,
you piece of shit.

00:25:30.154 --> 00:25:31.905
What the hell did you just say, big boy?

00:25:31.989 --> 00:25:36.910
You didn't hear me? I could really
rip apart some pig skin, you know?

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:40.414
HOLDING CELL

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:45.878
Son of a bitch.

00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:48.505
You must think
that cops are a real fuckin' joke.

00:25:48.589 --> 00:25:49.590
Of course not.

00:25:49.673 --> 00:25:52.301
Otherwise I wouldn't be here
on our cute date.

00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:54.470
Just clean the piss pot.
It's startin' to stink.

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:58.140
Oh, for fuck's sake.
How long do I gotta stay here? Huh?

00:25:58.223 --> 00:26:00.851
Let me just get Professor Kim and go.

00:26:00.934 --> 00:26:04.063
Tell me somethin'.
What'd this guy do to you exactly?

00:26:05.856 --> 00:26:09.109
What he did... The bastard,
he sold fakes to Ma.

00:26:09.193 --> 00:26:10.652
Your mother's line of work is?

00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:14.406
Antiques. She's got a store
in Busan that's named after me.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.826
You're saying
this guy sold her fake pottery, then?

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:21.330
Yeah, I already told you.
He lied and said they were from Sinan.

00:26:22.498 --> 00:26:24.708
- How much money was it?
- I don't know that.

00:26:24.792 --> 00:26:27.336
With antiques,
it's whatever you can get is what you get.

00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:29.755
I'm wasting time here.

00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:32.925
Backwater fucks don't know shit.

00:26:33.008 --> 00:26:35.219
Whatever you can get, huh?

00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:40.682
{\an8}BUSAN

00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:46.772
Hello? Is anyone here?

00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:49.775
Oh, good.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.194
- Ms. Yang.
- Oh, Coach.

00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:53.946
What brings you here?

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:55.197
They arrested Deoksan.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.950
Mokpo's got him in jail. The police
won't let him out of there.

00:26:58.033 --> 00:26:59.576
Mokpo? What's he doing there?

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.746
He was trying to catch this guy who
scammed me on an antiques deal.

00:27:03.372 --> 00:27:05.124
Really?

00:27:05.207 --> 00:27:07.668
Want me to round up some boys
and make my way over there?

00:27:07.751 --> 00:27:09.378
Could you do that though?

00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:11.713
If you're willing, well,
I've got enough cash here.

00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:14.800
Nah. It's quite all right.
I've been meaning to go on a trip.

00:27:14.883 --> 00:27:18.929
Oh, I appreciate it. Thank you so much.
Truly.

00:27:19.847 --> 00:27:21.723
You wanted to talk to me?

00:27:21.807 --> 00:27:23.016
Yeah, yeah, I did.

00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:26.395
Thing is, you see,
our boy Deoksan's in trouble.

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:28.897
I need some guys to
come to Mokpo and help.

00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:30.941
Might be taking a few days,

00:27:31.024 --> 00:27:34.069
don't really know what's out there,
so be ready for anything.

00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:35.821
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:42.286
It's just you two? No one else is coming?

00:27:42.369 --> 00:27:44.454
Yeah, one of them had to manage the store

00:27:44.538 --> 00:27:46.665
and the other,
it's his dad's 60th birthday.

00:27:46.748 --> 00:27:47.749
That right?

00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:49.209
Man, that's not looking too good there.

00:27:49.293 --> 00:27:50.627
I got the other one, I'm good.

00:27:50.711 --> 00:27:52.170
That's cool, but, brother,
what's up with your neck?

00:27:52.254 --> 00:27:53.714
If I keep it steady, it's doable.

00:27:53.797 --> 00:27:54.923
Oh, yeah? Let's go.

00:27:57.551 --> 00:28:00.512
We're gonna need some cash for the trip.
Let's make the rounds first.

00:28:00.596 --> 00:28:04.600
Oh, but we just made the rounds.
You think that's all right?

00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:08.020
Hey, let's try not to embarrass ourselves
while we're out there. Got it?

00:28:08.103 --> 00:28:09.897
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.410
- Don't you need to get back to work?
- We don't get a lot of customers.

00:28:25.829 --> 00:28:27.873
How did you end up
working there anyway?

00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:30.751
My grandma got sick.

00:28:32.628 --> 00:28:35.380
The hospital said
she had to have three surgeries.

00:28:36.298 --> 00:28:38.926
I just finished middle school
and was working here and there,

00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:41.470
so obviously I couldn't pay what we owed.

00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:43.555
I was broke.

00:28:44.806 --> 00:28:47.267
I knew I had to try and
do something for her, though.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.356
Then one day the shrimp stall guy,
he introduced me to Ms. Jang.

00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:56.485
She said she'd cover the whole thing.
I couldn't be more thankful.

00:28:58.195 --> 00:28:59.905
That's how you started there?

00:29:01.031 --> 00:29:04.201
I thought the job was
just making coffee, but I was wrong.

00:29:05.077 --> 00:29:08.497
These old men came into the store,
got all handsy and groped me.

00:29:09.623 --> 00:29:11.541
So I got the hell out of there.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.044
Wasn't long before I got caught.

00:29:14.795 --> 00:29:18.423
And when I did, that's when
she shaved my head. Beat my ass too.

00:29:19.967 --> 00:29:21.885
That wasn't the last time you ran, though?

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.638
I lost count since then.

00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:27.265
I was always such a pain in the ass.

00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:29.851
She said I wasn't allowed
to talk to customers anymore.

00:29:29.935 --> 00:29:31.853
Well, that worked out.

00:29:32.688 --> 00:29:34.398
I'm smarter than you thought, aren't I?

00:29:40.988 --> 00:29:44.866
The hell? Are you kidding me?
They can't be fucking serious.

00:29:48.328 --> 00:29:50.288
How are we gonna get a thousand like this?

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:53.834
Everyone's wiped out.
What are we supposed to do?

00:29:55.877 --> 00:29:59.006
Beolgu sure chose one hell
of a time to run off, didn't he?

00:29:59.715 --> 00:30:02.134
How the hell did he run off in that state?

00:30:02.217 --> 00:30:03.468
No idea.

00:30:03.552 --> 00:30:05.053
Unbelievable.

00:30:05.137 --> 00:30:08.265
Oh, by the way, Jeonchul,
he's got a fever.

00:30:09.558 --> 00:30:11.768
- Jeonchul does?
- Man, he was throwing up all night.

00:30:11.852 --> 00:30:13.895
Ah, shit.

00:30:31.621 --> 00:30:32.873
Hey, is he okay?

00:30:34.207 --> 00:30:37.669
He's completely out of it.
There's no way he can work today.

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:41.673
Daesik.

00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:46.803
Hey, Na Daesik.

00:30:47.763 --> 00:30:48.764
Hmm?

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.518
Are you still in pain?

00:30:53.602 --> 00:30:56.813
Yeah, I think I'll need
a few more days before I can work.

00:30:56.897 --> 00:30:58.523
It looks like you're okay now.

00:30:58.607 --> 00:31:00.108
No, I'm not.

00:31:00.192 --> 00:31:03.320
You sayin' I'm the kind of guy
who'll try to pretend to be sick

00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:04.946
so he can bail on work?

00:31:11.912 --> 00:31:13.413
Feel good?

00:31:15.499 --> 00:31:16.583
Oh.

00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:20.253
Oh.

00:31:21.963 --> 00:31:23.465
Get your ass on the boat.

00:31:31.973 --> 00:31:33.141
Tuck your head in.

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:35.769
A little more. That's it.

00:31:43.485 --> 00:31:45.946
Hey. Is it really a good idea
for him to do this?

00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:48.657
We're all going in.
Daesik is no exception.

00:31:51.785 --> 00:31:53.036
And Beolgu?

00:32:43.128 --> 00:32:45.463
Hope I don't end up joining the mermaids.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.444
Whoa, whoa! I'm-I'm losing balance!
I'm losing...

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.656
I'm okay. Thank you.

00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:24.336
Excuse me.

00:33:26.546 --> 00:33:28.006
Is anyone here?

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:40.810
Uh, hello? Is anyone home?

00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:49.819
Oh. Uh... I'm sorry.

00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:51.488
Heedong went out.

00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:54.866
Could I leave this for him here then?

00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:57.202
Sure.

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:01.665
Thank you.

00:34:09.965 --> 00:34:13.009
Look, look. See? I told you.
I told you she's here.

00:34:13.093 --> 00:34:14.719
You crazy little bitch.

00:34:14.803 --> 00:34:17.555
Why the hell are you here?

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:21.059
I never thought I'd have
to drag my ass out to Jeungdo.

00:34:21.142 --> 00:34:22.686
You're in trouble now.

00:34:22.769 --> 00:34:24.271
You found me.

00:34:34.531 --> 00:34:37.033
Daesik needs to get out.
He's been down there for an hour.

00:34:37.617 --> 00:34:40.704
Just a bit longer.
He can go for two hours.

00:34:40.787 --> 00:34:44.165
Yeah, that's for guys who are experts
at this. You know we're new here.

00:34:44.249 --> 00:34:47.669
Yeah, we're all new at this.
So what? Who here's an expert?

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:50.380
Oh. Help him.

00:34:50.463 --> 00:34:52.090
Oh, hey, he's up.

00:34:52.173 --> 00:34:55.093
Hey, Seokbae, you did it!

00:34:55.176 --> 00:34:57.095
- You got quite a haul, didn't you?
- Guys.

00:34:57.178 --> 00:34:59.431
- It's a bit easier now, right?
- Good work.

00:34:59.514 --> 00:35:00.765
Like hell it is.

00:35:00.849 --> 00:35:02.851
You wouldn't be saying that shit
if you were going in.

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:05.645
I'm not doing any more today. I'm done.

00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:07.606
And what about Daesik then?

00:35:08.148 --> 00:35:10.358
He should be fine. I don't know.

00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:12.819
- Shit.
- I'm exhausted.

00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:36.551
He'll have to stay in bed for a while.

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:39.638
His blood pressure is
dangerously elevated.

00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:43.433
Oh, what do I do?
Should I take him to the hospital?

00:35:43.516 --> 00:35:45.685
You said he drank a lot last night?

00:35:45.769 --> 00:35:47.145
Oh, yes, he did.

00:35:48.021 --> 00:35:51.358
The company executives came over
to have dinner with us, and...

00:35:51.441 --> 00:35:52.442
and...

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.738
Didn't I already mention to you
that he shouldn't be drinking?

00:35:57.238 --> 00:36:00.158
Oh, no.
I've almost killed my husband.

00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:02.827
I'm such a fool.

00:36:02.911 --> 00:36:08.458
I just had to invite a singer who happened
to have a hit wartime song!

00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:10.418
Usually after an alcohol overdose,

00:36:10.502 --> 00:36:12.587
I recommend the patient rest
for a few days.

00:36:13.213 --> 00:36:15.965
However, with your husband's
high blood pressure and heart condition,

00:36:16.049 --> 00:36:17.467
this could be truly fatal.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.637
Oh, what did I do?

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.306
I did this! I killed Hwangsik!

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:29.479
Well, then. I should go, Mrs. Yang.

00:36:29.562 --> 00:36:31.147
Okay.

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:51.459
How big of a bonus did you get

00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:54.504
when you picked the contractor
for the Yeouido complex?

00:36:54.587 --> 00:36:58.299
Hardly any. Manager Yoon
tried to settle it with just one million.

00:36:58.383 --> 00:37:00.218
I barely managed to grab two.

00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:02.053
Still, that's good.

00:37:02.137 --> 00:37:04.848
You've got to take
as much as you can when you can.

00:37:04.931 --> 00:37:07.142
Speaking of, the former bookkeeper

00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:09.561
is now trying to run
the whole company, isn't she?

00:37:09.644 --> 00:37:12.188
She really is.

00:37:12.272 --> 00:37:14.566
Well, I mean, her husband's
the chairman, right?

00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:16.609
She's making the most of it,
that's for sure.

00:37:16.693 --> 00:37:18.653
- To think she was a nobody.
- That's right.

00:37:18.737 --> 00:37:22.365
All that aside,
I'm looking forward to you becoming CEO.

00:37:22.449 --> 00:37:23.450
I'm counting on you.

00:37:23.533 --> 00:37:25.785
Don't get ahead of yourself, all right?

00:37:25.869 --> 00:37:29.247
There's a lot of eyes on us.
We've got to be careful.

00:38:05.742 --> 00:38:08.328
HEUNGBAEK CORPORATION INC.

00:38:13.249 --> 00:38:15.126
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:17.754
Thank you for calling
Heungbaek Corporation. Yes.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.478
Where did all the files go?

00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:36.815
Oh. Mrs. Yang came by this morning
and cleared them all out.

00:38:36.898 --> 00:38:39.526
She also said she wants to see you
in the chairman's office.

00:38:39.609 --> 00:38:41.736
Damn it, what now?

00:38:44.656 --> 00:38:45.824
Yes, yes.

00:38:45.907 --> 00:38:47.242
Mm-hmm. Looks good.

00:38:54.582 --> 00:38:56.000
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

00:38:56.084 --> 00:38:57.585
Glad you're here.

00:38:57.669 --> 00:38:59.128
What did you want to discuss?

00:38:59.212 --> 00:39:01.881
Your spending's a little,
I would say, generous.

00:39:01.965 --> 00:39:04.425
Sorry?

00:39:09.722 --> 00:39:11.891
Uh, how can I help, Mrs. Yang?

00:39:13.476 --> 00:39:16.437
How's the chairman?
Is he doing all right?

00:39:16.521 --> 00:39:18.439
He overdid it with the drinks
and got sick.

00:39:18.523 --> 00:39:20.733
He'll be out of the office for a while.

00:39:20.817 --> 00:39:21.943
Hmm?

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:23.820
I looked at the personnel records.

00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:26.030
You're all connected
in various ways, aren't you?

00:39:26.114 --> 00:39:29.325
The chairman's hometown acquaintances,
his late wife's relatives...

00:39:30.493 --> 00:39:33.413
Mr. Lee, correct me if I'm wrong,
but you were her cousin.

00:39:33.496 --> 00:39:35.039
Uh, yes.

00:39:35.123 --> 00:39:37.876
I know for a fact the chairman
felt sorry for his late wife

00:39:37.959 --> 00:39:39.878
when he decided to bring you on.

00:39:39.961 --> 00:39:42.046
It's a shame you're doing this to him.

00:39:42.714 --> 00:39:43.882
I checked the books.

00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:46.509
The three of you are taking what you want.

00:39:46.593 --> 00:39:50.471
Ma'am, that's just a gesture
of showing appreciation.

00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:53.141
I'd agree, except it's over 200 million.

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:54.767
You have to admit that's too much.

00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:57.395
There's not a single company
that operates differently.

00:39:57.478 --> 00:39:58.521
Every company does this.

00:39:58.605 --> 00:40:01.524
Yes, everyone does this. Yeah.

00:40:03.443 --> 00:40:04.861
Let me introduce you.

00:40:04.944 --> 00:40:07.155
Namdaemun Police, Detective Choi.

00:40:08.323 --> 00:40:09.991
Detective Choi Donggeun.

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:11.492
My offer's quite simple.

00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:14.120
Do you want to cough up
all the money and get investigated,

00:40:14.203 --> 00:40:16.539
or would you prefer quietly resigning?

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:18.625
The choice is yours.

00:40:23.212 --> 00:40:25.256
There's a personnel announcement.

00:40:29.469 --> 00:40:30.887
PERSONNEL STATUS CHANGES

00:40:31.638 --> 00:40:34.349
Shit. They all got cut, didn't they?

00:40:34.432 --> 00:40:36.643
Even Lee got the boot too.

00:40:36.726 --> 00:40:38.394
- Oh, man.
- Right?

00:40:38.478 --> 00:40:41.105
You think we're gonna be okay losing
all these important executives?

00:40:41.189 --> 00:40:42.482
Important, my ass.

00:40:42.565 --> 00:40:45.401
The chairman's in-laws, relatives,
they're all guys like that.

00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:46.945
Well, that's true.

00:40:47.028 --> 00:40:49.197
This is great news
for the general managers, I think.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.241
- They can all finally move up the ladder.
- You're right.

00:40:52.325 --> 00:40:54.118
They were doing all the work
for no credit.

00:40:54.202 --> 00:40:55.203
Exactly.

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:56.704
- Fuck!
- What the hell?

00:40:56.788 --> 00:41:00.208
That fucking bitch. I...

00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:13.179
Here they are.

00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:20.353
{\an8}"Park Minguk, Yoon Deokho, Lee Jeongho."

00:41:21.646 --> 00:41:24.315
He handed his money out like candy.

00:41:24.399 --> 00:41:26.442
WITHDRAWAL - DEPOSIT - TOTAL

00:41:29.988 --> 00:41:32.156
Now where are his seals?

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.241
Let's see...

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:41.416
They're missing.

00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:52.844
You need to open the windows.

00:41:53.636 --> 00:41:55.638
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, it's rank.

00:42:00.268 --> 00:42:02.103
How's he been? Has he slept all day?

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:04.731
Yes, and he hasn't been eating anything.

00:42:08.651 --> 00:42:10.403
- You can go.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:22.165
Honey, can you hear me?

00:42:22.915 --> 00:42:26.544
The passbooks in the safe,
what did you do with the seals?

00:42:28.463 --> 00:42:31.090
I looked everywhere
but I still couldn't find them.

00:42:31.758 --> 00:42:33.593
Where are they? Hmm?

00:42:37.513 --> 00:42:38.598
Oh, my.

00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:43.352
What's wrong? Are you in pain?
Need your meds?

00:42:44.353 --> 00:42:46.522
Well, what is it? What do you need?

00:42:46.606 --> 00:42:48.316
You have to say it.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.325
Just sleep then.

00:42:59.202 --> 00:43:00.995
I've still got a lot to do.

00:43:01.079 --> 00:43:05.208
I feel like I'm going crazy these days,
trying to clean up your mess.

00:43:37.115 --> 00:43:39.033
That's fucking disgusting.

00:43:47.333 --> 00:43:50.878
Man, another one might be
kicking it at this rate. Shit.

00:43:50.962 --> 00:43:53.214
How're we gonna get any work done?

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:55.383
Hey.
You want some miyeokguk, man?

00:44:02.932 --> 00:44:04.684
Can we go somewhere quiet?

00:44:06.018 --> 00:44:08.437
- Why?
- I need to talk to you.

00:44:08.521 --> 00:44:10.815
We can talk here.

00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:15.069
Do you really know
what you're doing, uncle?

00:44:17.363 --> 00:44:18.781
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

00:44:18.865 --> 00:44:20.366
We're all gonna die at this rate.

00:44:20.992 --> 00:44:23.327
Two of our men are sick, so what the hell
do you expect us to do?

00:44:23.411 --> 00:44:24.912
Well, are you gonna dive in the water?

00:44:26.122 --> 00:44:27.373
Course I am.

00:44:28.666 --> 00:44:30.334
Watch your fucking mouth, kid.

00:44:38.634 --> 00:44:39.844
Jeonchul.

00:44:40.595 --> 00:44:42.305
You're diving tomorrow.

00:44:43.931 --> 00:44:45.558
I still don't feel that good.

00:44:46.976 --> 00:44:48.895
I've had enough of this shit.

00:44:48.978 --> 00:44:50.646
We're shorthanded as it is.

00:44:51.564 --> 00:44:53.983
Don't you feel guilty for making us
do all the work?

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:59.572
Tomorrow, you and Heedong
are diving in, so be ready.

00:44:59.655 --> 00:45:00.823
And I'm going in after.

00:45:05.828 --> 00:45:06.829
Heedong.

00:45:08.706 --> 00:45:09.707
Come here.

00:45:14.503 --> 00:45:16.547
That coffee shop girl was here.

00:45:16.631 --> 00:45:18.174
She left something for you.

00:46:05.137 --> 00:46:06.138
Shit.

00:46:08.474 --> 00:46:10.935
Excuse me, sir, you know where the girl
who was staying here went?

00:46:11.018 --> 00:46:12.770
How the heck should I know that?

00:46:12.853 --> 00:46:14.897
She just beat it without saying a word.

00:46:25.491 --> 00:46:27.827
Taesan, you son of a bitch!

00:46:28.369 --> 00:46:30.913
You call yourself a man? Huh?

00:46:32.581 --> 00:46:35.459
Die, you bastard. Fucking die, bastard!

00:46:35.543 --> 00:46:37.712
Just fucking die, you piece of shit!

00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:39.338
What are you doing?

00:46:39.422 --> 00:46:41.674
What are you doing? Get off me!

00:46:41.757 --> 00:46:45.052
- Just don't.
- I'm going to kill that motherfucker!

00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:47.305
How could you do that,
you piece of shit?

00:46:47.388 --> 00:46:49.098
- Stop it.
- Let go of me.

00:46:49.181 --> 00:46:51.058
Let go of me, Dohun! Fuck!

00:46:51.142 --> 00:46:54.061
- You'll wake everyone up.
- Let him go.

00:46:54.145 --> 00:46:55.229
I said let him go.

00:46:55.313 --> 00:46:57.106
Just let him go.

00:47:03.195 --> 00:47:06.324
Do whatever you want.
I'm not gonna fight you.

00:47:10.453 --> 00:47:13.289
Why'd you do it, huh?
You gonna kill us too?

00:47:13.372 --> 00:47:15.708
If one of us gets fucked up
like Beolgu did...

00:47:15.791 --> 00:47:17.710
...will you toss us in the drink too?

00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:19.462
Huh?

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:25.801
Fuck. What the hell do you think
we're even doing this for?

00:47:26.594 --> 00:47:28.137
Just to make some petty cash?

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.890
- You think that's it?
- You fucking idiot.

00:47:32.767 --> 00:47:35.770
The hell you asking me that? Huh?

00:47:36.395 --> 00:47:40.358
If you're done throwing a fit,
go and try to get some rest.

00:47:41.359 --> 00:47:42.735
We got a long day ahead.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:46.447
Taesan. Tell me.

00:47:48.407 --> 00:47:50.326
What are you planning to do
with his share?

00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:58.626
- What's that?
- Beolgu's pay.

00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:02.505
None of us are gonna take that.

00:48:05.091 --> 00:48:06.759
That's his mother's, all right?

00:48:07.468 --> 00:48:09.345
Swear to me that you'll give it to her.

00:48:10.054 --> 00:48:11.972
Then I won't spill a word.

00:48:12.056 --> 00:48:13.349
Okay?

00:48:23.776 --> 00:48:25.236
Fuck me.

00:48:33.869 --> 00:48:37.081
Heedong, if you panic,
you'll have trouble breathing.

00:48:37.164 --> 00:48:40.251
So just stay calm.
We'll keep your air flowing.

00:48:40.334 --> 00:48:42.545
- Got it.
- You vent the air like this,

00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:44.922
so you can sink down lower,
and to come back up...

00:48:45.005 --> 00:48:46.006
I said I know!

00:48:47.842 --> 00:48:49.135
Tuck your head.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.928
You little shit.

00:48:52.513 --> 00:48:53.639
Be careful!

00:48:55.266 --> 00:48:56.600
All right, turn it.

00:48:56.684 --> 00:48:57.768
Turning.

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:23.085
That's it.

00:49:40.978 --> 00:49:42.313
The boy's a natural.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.588
I can't see anything.

00:50:46.126 --> 00:50:47.294
What's that?

00:50:59.765 --> 00:51:01.559
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:51:01.642 --> 00:51:03.769
Oh, shit! What's going on?

00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:07.815
What the hell? The current's going crazy!

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:10.067
We're on top of a damn tidal channel.

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:13.237
When the tide goes out, it rushes
at seven to nine kilos per hour.

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.322
Hot dang, just look at it.
