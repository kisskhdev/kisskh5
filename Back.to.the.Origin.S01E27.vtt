00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.320
So well-behaved! Name?

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.080
Staying still.

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:43.560
Its name is "Budong".

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.640
"Budong"?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.800
Nah, its name is Happy.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.759
That's a nice name. Happy.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.479
Hey, Happy!

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.280
Did you get in touch with your dad?

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.800
Yes, I did.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.840
I totally forgot

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.880
about the time difference.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.800
Thanks for letting me stay here,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.080
or I'd be sleeping rough tonight.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.880
I don't believe that.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.520
Really!

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.600
I actually like it here.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.520
It feels safe.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.759
Can I ask you something?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.520
My dad won't be back home for a while,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.880
so during this time,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.320
could I stay here?

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.520
Because my stepmother

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.360
and her son are at home...

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.960
I understand.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.600
Thanks.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.840
I remember you told me

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.000
you were raised by your grandmother.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.480
Quite a lot has happened recently.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.240
Yu posted the clip

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.040
of you as a designated driver

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.520
in the overseas students' group.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.160
Only then did I know you were back.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.880
Stop messing with the sofa.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.800
If you don't mind,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.640
I've cleaned up that room.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.960
You can stay there.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.360
I'm fine with it

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.240
as long as you don't mind.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.240
Thanks, that's really kind of you.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.560
Hey... why'd you

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.040
end up working at the zoo?

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.640
I never knew

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.640
you liked animals.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.640
My grandmother loves animals.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.320
She says they're easier than people.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.600
There are lots of pigeons upstairs.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.960
Can I use them as models?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.800
I want to draw them.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.160
You flew all this way

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.240
just to draw pigeons?

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.360
Of course not!

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.320
Pigeons are everywhere.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.120
I draw what I see.

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.560
I signed a contract with a gallery.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.880
I came back to sign the contract

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.960
and get some inspiration.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.640
You want to draw pigeons?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.600
Go ahead.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.320
This place works.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.880
The view is nice.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.320
I can set up my canvas

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.080
right here

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.880
and paint.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.680
Sure, sure.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.760
The environment is pretty basic.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.000
If you're serious about art,

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.320
clean up this mess first.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.279
How amateur.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.760
Art can happen anywhere.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.360
Remember when we used to

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.240
be at the activity center

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.040
or community center,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.680
rehearsing?

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.120
How's the drama club doing now?

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.080
The drama club?

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.440
Well,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.240
it disbanded right after you left.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.159
Without you there,

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:42.240
what's the point of getting together?

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.080
Let me ask you,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.280
why did you never

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.320
keep in touch with everyone?

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.520
Did you really not

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.520
miss any of us?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.600
Looking back now,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.400
in Canada,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.080
I was quite naive.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.200
Back then with the drama club,

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.360
I wasn't even sure

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.160
if I was really interested.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.040
For me,

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.160
it was just killing time.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.040
Am I hearing right,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.760
Ge Kaiyang?

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.080
This doesn't sound like you.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.960
Didn't you always say

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.760
to just do things

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.160
without overthinking the meaning?

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.000
If it's fun,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.080
isn't that enough?

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.400
Experience changes people.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.200
After losing everything,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.000
I see how privileged that sounded.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.920
When I was in Canada,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.840
I sometimes had this

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.120
internal dialogue

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.040
about the

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.040
meaning of life.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.360
Back then,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.360
I thought living happily

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.960
was enough to make life worthwhile.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.760
It wasn't until I came back

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.080
that I realized how much I'd missed.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.680
I failed my grandmother

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.320
and I failed

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.800
to handle things at home.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.080
I just hope

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.880
that from now on,

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.720
I don't fail anyone else.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.440
There's also someone else

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.400
I owe a lot to.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.320
That's my emotional knot.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.360
Can you tell me now

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.520
why you came back too?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.720
Kuang Dazhi's personal guarantee

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.640
fell through.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.760
My work visa was cancelled.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.120
I'm sorry.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.680
It's okay. It's all in the past.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.320
Why don't you go home?

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.760
I... I came back

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.600
in a panic.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.440
Which home should I go to?

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.920
What are your plans now?

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.480
I just hope my parents' issues

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.520
get resolved soon.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.840
Live well

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.920
and take care of my grandmother.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.840
I wonder when I die,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.440
what will be written on this form,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.000
and who will

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.080
fill it out for me.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.600
So much happened after I got back.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.280
Luckily, Lu Xinying was there.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.640
Otherwise I don't know

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.520
how I'd have made it.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.600
How did you two end up

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.280
like this now?

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.440
I don't want to get into details.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.960
But I definitely owe her a lot.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.640

Hello,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.320
Mr. Li!

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.080
Um, about this...

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.560
I received the pilot program proposal,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.120
but why is it only

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.440
Mr. Fu?

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.280
I understand,

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.800
I understand.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.880
Yes, but Mr. Fu...

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.600
I know, I know.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.520
You see, because Mr. Fu

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.680
is actually

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.840
very shy.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.840
Yes, and

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.160
when he sees cameras,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.280
he'll definitely be nervous.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.160
I was thinking maybe I could

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.040
participate too,

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.440
help create a better atmosphere,

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.240
and then also

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.400
introduce the products.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.120
What do you think?

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.800
I understand.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.840
I understand.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.800
Alright,

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:53.960
I get it.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.360
Of course, I get it.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.800
Okay then.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.600
Alright, that's it.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.240
Good!

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.680
Thank you!

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:08.880
Well,

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.800
you go alone.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.040
It's impossible, absolutely impossible.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.520
Go alone

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.600
and face the cameras?

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.800
Wasn't it agreed before?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.360
I'm just supposed to be a mascot

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.480
while you do the talking!

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.400
Well, they don't want me,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.160
so you'll have to go solo now.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.760
Don't mess up!

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:46.800
Let's do this,

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.560
forget about the brand story first,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.040
memorize the product introduction.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:50.640
Hurry up!

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.120
You go!

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.160
Quick!

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.560
These clinical trials,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.440
I'll just

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.560
display them

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.080
for you to read.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.840
You do it.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.120
Get moving!

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.560
Quick!

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.840
How can I remember all this?

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.160
You're a PhD,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.240
what can't you memorize?

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.400
Let me see,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.000
these Asian skin characteristics...

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.720
How about I

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.960
write them on your hand?

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.280
I think

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.200
tonight's going to be tough

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.120
if you need to memorize.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.480
In a foreign land,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.680
we faced

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.560
many challenges together.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.000
I saw my wife's

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.520
struggle with skin issues

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.960
caused by the new

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.800
climate and environment.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.720
Watching her

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.880
in discomfort

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.240
broke my heart.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:35.880
Please stop! I'm begging you!

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.280
Does this sound natural?

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.360
The way you're speaking, really,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.080
is even worse than

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.000
AI reading!

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.800
You have such good resources,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.360
but here you are,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.080
memorizing this,

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.280
while I have to watch.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.080
What resources?

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.080
Zhang Ran,

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.520
the host, broadcaster, and influencer,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.160
could easily coach you!

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.360
Are you two still on bad terms?

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.600
Look at what you're doing,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.280
making me feel so guilty!

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.400
My bad.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.800
Really!

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.480
Really, from now on,

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.960
I won't say anything, really.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.480
But you can't entirely blame me.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.520
Yudong, let me tell you,

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.760
such a big thing with your father,

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.600
you didn't tell Ran about it!

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.000
Are you still letting me memorize?

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.920
Are you still letting me

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.200
participate in this pilot?

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.080
Fine, you're a rare specimen now,

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.080
just keep memorizing.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.480
About my situation with her,

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.960
it's complicated to explain.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:33.960
What do you mean?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.640
That day,

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.800
I meant to explain

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.480
but got interrupted

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.400
and missed the chance.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.440
But she should understand.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.760
No, what do you mean by 'should'?

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.960
You can't just guess in relationships!

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.320
Ran even came to me

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.800
specifically about this matter!

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.880
About Cheng Man's merits and interests...

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.680
There are so many merits.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.640
Basically,

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.280
all of humanity's virtues.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.000
She has a bit of each one.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.720
Does she have

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.920
anything she particularly likes.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.240
She loves lots of things.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.440
Fresh air, healthy food.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.840
Flowers and plants, jewelry.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.080
She loves them all.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.560
My son.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.280
And me too.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.480
She's quite fond of both.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.280
Drink like that, you'll get thrown out.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:30.800
Is that so?

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.440
Yes.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.640
I'll kick you out.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.920
She asked you about Cheng Man.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.320
She wants to learn from a good example.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.600
She just wanted to learn

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.080
how to be a good wife?

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.280
Look at her.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.920
So proactive at solving problems.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.120
Now look at yourself.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.280
You should

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.320
step up your game.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.520
Nian.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.440
Why are you

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.520
playing with puzzles here?

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.160
Where's Mom?

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.080
His mom's not here. But I'm here.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:03.920
Why are you here?

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.280
Don't let him drink that.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.720
His mom doesn't allow it!

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.480
His mom's not home right now!

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.880
Come on, quick! Nian...

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.880
Where did his mom go?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.880
She went out for dinner.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.080
With whom?

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.640
How should I know?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.960
Slow down.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.680
Come here.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.480
Who is it?

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.400
Yudong, what's up?

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.120
Who's Zhang Ran

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.200
having dinner with?

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.800
I might be wrong.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.280
Probably with Cheng Man.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.520
She wants to learn from her.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.040
Don't slack off.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.040
It's a good chance

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.520
to practice those eight dishes.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.480
Get out.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.960
Mom, can you do something about him?

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.640
Yudong's getting so disrespectful.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.720
Nian, go to your room

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.880
and play for a while, okay?

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:48.920
Come on, Nian, be good.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.880
Dad will play with you.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.520
Let him play alone.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.640
No, I'll go with him.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.080
No, he should play alone.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.800
I want to play.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.480
He plays alone! Sit down.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.720
Take this, quick.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.440
Nian, go play

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.160
in the tent.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.640
Wait for me in the tent.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.280
We'll play

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.120
Crazy Caveman later.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.000
Don't spill it.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.040
The cavemen are invading.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.440
Stop howling - sit down.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:09.920
My ears are bad.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.800
I don't want to hear anything.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.520
Don't talk.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.480
Bad ears or not, you have to listen.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.120
I've gone deaf.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.800
Can't hear anything.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.200
This is serious.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.640
Look at this child.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.520
At this age,

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.840
still staying at home.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.960
No, about this,

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.800
Cheng Man has her own plans.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.880
She'll plan and arrange things herself.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.600
Just leave it be, okay?

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.200
I'm his grandmother.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.240
How can I not worry?

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.040
What about Cheng Man's

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.960
arrangements?

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.000
What plan does she have?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.920
Her arrangement is just

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.920
to keep the child at home.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.720
Kids need to play with other kids.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.680
They need to be outside often,

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.280
running around, back and forth.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.000
That's how their personality develops,

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:44.880
right?

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.920
That's how they'll

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.240
integrate into society faster.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.120
Staying home all day,

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.840
what kind of life is that?

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.560
Are you sleeping?

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.840
No need to integrate into the society.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.360
How old is he anyway?

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.640
What do you want from him?

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.880
You tell me.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.440
You're being ridiculous,

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.360
making alarmist statements.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.760
How am I being alarmist?

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.080
I'm stating facts.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.800
Fine, I see

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.839
how it is.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.440
No matter what I say,

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.599
it's wrong.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.400
While your wife Cheng Man,

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.720
everything she says is right.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.760
You always just say yes

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:13.599
to everything.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.040
Everything she says is right.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.839
I just don't understand you.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.440
A dignified grown man like you,

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.160
six feet

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.520
tall.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:23.200
Your family has just three people,

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.720
including that hamster.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.920
Son, you rank fourth.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.520
I'm telling you.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.120
Your family status is really concerning.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.400
Mrs. Wang, you're now attempting

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.320
to stir up trouble

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.400
in my family.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.240
You...

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:37.920
Besides, at our home,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.040
how do I not have status?

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.520
Look, the living room now

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.560
is all my space.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.800
This is all mine too, see.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.880
Come on, is this really yours?

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.480
This is her greenhouse.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.400
Knew it was a greenhouse. Sharp.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.440
At least I have

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.120
one small area.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.520
Stop joking around, I'm being serious.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.200
Stop laughing.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.720
Okay.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.040
So full of ideas?

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.440
Tell Cheng Man yourself.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.720
I'm afraid when relaying your message,

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.400
I might miss something.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.240
No.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.600
You know I don't dare talk to her.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.600
That's why I'm telling you.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.880
I've found the root.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.000
I got it from you.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.480
Get out.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.480
Yudong got it from you too.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.640
Look at this.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.960
How did you pass these traits

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.200
even to Yudong?

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.480
Stop talking nonsense.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.840
I'm trying to discuss something serious.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.520
I'm trying to discuss

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.800
something serious.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.000
I know, I know. You don't worry.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.040
Stop playing, Nian.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.920
Dad will take you to university.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.560
Damn you.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.760
You're killing me.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.840
Come here, caveman.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.760
Don't listen to your dad.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.080
He's talking nonsense.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.160
Weren't we playing cavemen?

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.160
Why are you playing video games now?

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.400
Just let him play games.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.080
Sit down.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:40.840
Your mom's not home.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.440
You're really letting loose.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.960
This will do for now.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.360
Okay, please wait.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.520
Let me pour it.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.240
Thank you.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.520
I've been wanting to find a chance

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.840
to thank Li Daoqi and you

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.960
for helping us so much.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.760
This is something I bought for you.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.840
I picked it.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.120
I don't know if you'll like it.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.120
If you don't like it,

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.880
I can exchange it.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.040
Don't look at me like that.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.560
I don't have other intentions.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.200
Li Daoqi and Fu Yudong

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.680
are like brothers anyway.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.880
If we look at it that way,

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.320
we're sisters-in-law.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.520
It's not strange for me to treat

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:28.760
a sister-in-law to dinner.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.240
Tell me what's on your mind.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.320
Just a small matter.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.080
I want to invite you to be my friend

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.040
and record a talk video.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.720
I've never recorded videos before.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.400
I'm new

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.560
to your industry.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.080
Besides,

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.080
we're not really close friends.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:51.680
Right?

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.520
I'm sorry.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.400
Actually,

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.800
there's a script.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.440
If during the recording,

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.280
anything goes wrong.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.320
I'll definitely take responsibility.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.560
Isn't that deceptive?

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.080
Zhang Ran.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.720
Maybe you're used to deceiving yourself.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.480
But I'm not.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.160
I'm not questioning you.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.480
It's just... we work in different fields.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.080
We're different people.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.600
Don't rush to decide.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.360
Let me honestly

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.600
talk to you about myself.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.600
Mom!

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.040
Mom!

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.840
It's so late.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.400
Why are you still here?

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.400
Let me call you a car.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.680
I'm really sorry.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.560
It's fine.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.840
I can spend

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.320
more time with my grandson.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.720
I made some white fungus soup for you,

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.520
wait, let me get you some.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.160
Thanks, Mom.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.120
Don't mention it.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.960
The temperature's just right.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.720
Mom, did you give Nian candy again?

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.480
Well...

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.920
He was crying so hard,

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.840
I couldn't calm him down.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.840
All that crying is no reason for candy.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.080
If you satisfy him once,

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.120
what about next time?

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.280
This added sugar

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.760
is not only bad for his teeth,

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.400
but also affects his intelligence.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.720
Is it that serious?

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.320
I actually ate most of it.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.560
That medical journal

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.360
I showed you before...

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.520
Especially with

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.000
Nian's condition now,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.120
it's particularly bad.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.040
That... that journal,

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.440
I didn't really understand it.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.640
I'll remember this time.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.280
If you want

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.560
me to watch Nian next time,

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.320
whatever requirements you have,

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.400
just tell me in advance.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.200
If anything's unclear.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.360
Are you fighting?

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.840
What are you talking about?

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.040
I called you a car.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.160
It's here, let's go.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.200
The car is here?

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.000
Go, go, hurry!

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.600
I'll go then.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.560
Remember to drink the soup!

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.480
Thanks, Mom.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.520
You're welcome.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.160
Oh!

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.360
I almost forgot.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.480
Since Li Daoqi

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.680
sold the wedding house for his startup,

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.520
so after thinking it over,

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.760
I had to set some aside for you.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.280
Take it.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.040
No, no, no!

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.480
This money was given to you.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.280
This house is yours now.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.160
Take it.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.800
You've supported him enough.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.920
And now you

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.040
don't have much income.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.400
Consider it our filial duty.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.680
Take it.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.800
Don't look at me.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.880
It's not from me.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.840
I tried to persuade her last night.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.960
She insisted on giving it to you.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.000
This is her filial duty to you alone.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.640
Well, well...

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.320
If that's the case,

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.680
then let's consider

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.280
this money as being kept with me.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.640
When you need money,

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.440
just ask me.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.640
I'll give it back to you.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.840
Alright, alright, that's settled then.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.640
Okay, time to go.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.160
The car's here, the car's here!

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:39.880
Hurry, it's late!

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.880
Okay, get some rest.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.280
Okay.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:41.760
We're going.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.960
Thanks, Mom.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.840
It's no trouble.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.840
Don't forget to drink the soup!

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.760
Take care, take care!

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.240
Text me when you get home.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:47.960
I will, I will.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.080
Take out all the money

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.400
and bury it in the hole.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.840
I'll bury you instead.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:52.480
Goodbye.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.080
Goodbye.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:53.880
Take care.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.560
I know.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.560
Time for bed, time for bed.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.200
Time for bed, time for bed.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.560
Someone doesn't want to sleep.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.680
Are you not tired?

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.720
Stop spoiling your mother.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.600
We have to be firm about Nian.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.200
Right. She won't come next time.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.240
She only causes problems.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.560
I'll tell the security

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.200
whenever they see her,

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.080
to escort her out.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.040
I'm being serious.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.960
I know, I know.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.600
But sometimes,

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.560
with Nian, you're really

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.800
a bit too worried.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.320
It's unnecessary.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.680
What do you mean "too worried"?

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.800
He's my child!

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.400
Who else should I worry about if not him?

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.840
Yes, I'm talking about my mom.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:38.840
My mom came today

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.160
to cover for you, right?

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.280
And taking care of Nian is not easy.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.920
She even made you white fungus soup

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.880
and everything,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.880
worried you'd be hungry coming home late.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.440
It's just a piece of candy.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.320
You come in and say all that.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.080
Eating candies is no big deal.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.560
I've been eating candies since little,

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.640
right?

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.480
She's elderly.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.200
Couldn't you be more understanding?

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.640
I know your mom worked hard,

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.000
but about the candy issue,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.600
I've already

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.320
told her many times.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.440
And, look,

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.440
Nian must have

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.600
played games all night.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.400
Look at this!

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.320
When did he turn on the game console?

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.120
I don't even know.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.040
Was it my mom who played?

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.160
She loves playing games these days.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.640
Let me tell you,

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.800
we should just hire a nanny.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.600
Then your mom won't

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.440
work so hard.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.440
One isn't enough. Let's hire four!

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.520
Put up a protective circle

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.440
with Nian in the center,

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.240
so nothing and no one

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.680
can get near him!

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.360
Fine, I understand.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.080
I'll seriously tell my mom.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.440
I've realized that

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.520
this matter is very serious.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.000
I'll let her know, don't worry.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.400
I'll tell her

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.240
to listen to you, absolutely.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.080
Listen,

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.960
everything I do now

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.080
is for Nian and you.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.520
Why did I

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.800
come home so late tonight?

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.600
I had dinner with Ran

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.200
for your sake, you know?

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:53.840
Yes, yes.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.080
And you're still criticizing me!

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.680
Really, Zhang Ran must

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.760
learn from you, truly.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.640
Compared to you, Zhang Ran

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.400
is nothing.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.720
Wanna take a shower?

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.680
No.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.760
I can scrub your back.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.400
No need.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.640
Then you scrub mine?

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.040
No.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.200
Just a little scrub...

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.280
These influencers nowadays

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.640
are really interesting.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.040
It's getting a bit oily.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:27.560
Perfect!

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.040
Please put on your earpieces.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.760
Can we wear them on either side?

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.520
Yes.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.040
When the director speaks,

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.280
we'll all be able to hear.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.400
If later

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.640
things get too intense,

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.120
do you have any concerns?

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.920
I'm fine with anything.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.320
You're the main character, up to you.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.640
Do you have any?

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.200
Even if I do, it's okay.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.440
I can overcome it.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.240
Let's just

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.160
be honest with each other.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.840
Lying would be too troublesome.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.440
Okay.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.960
Alright, crew members,

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.040
please clear out!

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.760
I know you don't like me.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.720
Actually, I don't like you much either.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.920
The reason I came to meet you today

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.240
is because

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.080
I have no one else to turn to.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.520
I don't have any close friends.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.240
As a person,

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.360
I have some personality issues.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.800
So whether in China or abroad,

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.720
I don't have many friends.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.320
Despite how I've appeared

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.480
successful these years,

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.280
it doesn't really matter.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.000
When times are good,

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.360
you feel like you're surrounded

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.840
by friends.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.720
But once good times have passed,

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.120
you're left with no one.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.080
It's quite sad.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.920
I thought

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.960
about finding an extra to help out.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.800
But after thinking it through,

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.240
at least I know Li Daoqi

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.400
inside out.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.040
You wouldn't try to cheat me.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.440
So I thought today,

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.160
we could give it a try.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.960
It's okay. I can understand

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.000
if you don't want to.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.720
And you indeed have every right to be.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.480
That's fine.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.800
Do you think we

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:22.720
look like close friends?

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.280
Whether believe it or not is their business.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.880
If you're willing to help me,

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.760
I'll accept whatever they think.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.720
Okay, let's look at the next question.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.360
Have you ever

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.640
talked behind your best friend's back?

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.760
Please answer.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.840
Three, two, one. Show your answers.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.960
Great, Team Anran

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.200
gets another point.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.720
For this round of

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.920
the "Meeting of Minds" segment...

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.160
Isn't it about being honest?

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.000
I'm just trying

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.440
to make myself look good.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.360
I'll be honest on the next question.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.160
I've checked out

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.080
the other nine brands' products.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.960
Let me tell you, tonight,

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.240
they're just to make up the numbers.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.760
I have a feeling

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.760
that Dr. Fu

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.120
might become famous overnight.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.640
Just watch.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.000
Dr. Fu, Mr. Li.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.280
Hello, Ms. Wang!

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.480
Well.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.680
I think you're clear

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.760
about the livestream process.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.160
Yes.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.600
But I still need to emphasize.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.600
In tonight's stream,

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.440
including yours,

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.680
there will be ten brands.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.160
Understood.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.840
Each brand has five minutes

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.600
to showcase products.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.040
Five minutes?

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.640
Yes, during these five minutes,

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.240
please make sure to follow

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.520
the outline we sent you earlier

00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.720
and introduce the products one by one.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.920
Lady Wan will lead you.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.320
Understood.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.200
Follow her lead

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.040
and introduce accordingly.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.120
Understood. Don't worry.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.160
Hold on, let me greet Lady Wan.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.520
I'll be right back.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.200
Dr. Fu, did you understand

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.280
what I just said?

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.240
Do I need to repeat?

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.880
No need.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.240
Then please prepare yourself.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.160
Lady Wan, this is Dr. Fu.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.160
He might be very nervous,

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.480
so please try your best

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.920
to support us.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.960
If anything goes wrong,

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.040
try to bring him back on track.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.920
Thank you, thank you.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.040
Thank you.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.040
Relax.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.760
Lady Wan has everything under control.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.800
Just stay calm.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.280
Be as natural

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.840
and relaxed as possible.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.320
No problem.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:42.880
It's over...

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.320
What's wrong?

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.360
No, no, don't say that.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.520
I can't remember

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.760
a single word.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.000
That's good!

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.120
It means you and Dr. Fu.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.960
have become one.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.320
This is what we call

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.720
the greatest form has no shape.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.920
And the greatest memory is like forgetting.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.800
Is that even a saying?

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.000
Relax, it's fine.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:08.960
It's fine.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.840
Relax.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.320
You're doing great.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.720
Hello, Dr. Fu!

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.040
I want to ask on behalf of all girls.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.160
How can we girls

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.520
maintain our best skin condition?

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.280
Sunscreen.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.040
That is, try to avoid

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.320
direct sun exposure.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.960
For example,

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.400
for who live in coastal areas

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.200
and highland regions,

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.040
and who

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.480
often engage in outdoor activities

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.720
and work,

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.080
their skin

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.280
gets damaged more severely.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.600
Instead, those who

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.160
live in places with year-round rain

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.360
where they don't get

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.400
much sun exposure,

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.160
their skin is much better.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.760
What if we get

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.520
sunburnt?

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.600
The best way

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.520
is to apply some aloe vera gel.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.040
What should we use

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.760
to repair our skin?

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.720
Repair...

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.760
How to repair it?

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.640
For...

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.240
For repair...

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.760
There's something called

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.920
ceramides.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.080
It exists in our

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.120
skin's stratum corneum as

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.560
a phospholipid.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.560
It can function as

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.640
repairing our damaged skin

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.040
and moisturizing.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.160
Yeah.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.840
How about your wife?

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.240
My wife is doing well.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.560
As far as I know,

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.080
when you were studying

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.000
in Toronto,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.640
you lived with your wife.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.080
The climate there,

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.040
along with skincare products

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.040
for your wife's

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.120
sensitive skin type, was very unfriendly.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.600
You tried many methods,

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.720
but nothing helped.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.360
So you decided

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.960
to develop your own product,

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.280
is that right?

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.920
Yes, my wife's

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.760
skin is actually...

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.120
Her metabolism speed

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.120
is relatively slow,

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.280
so the conventional

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.840
moisturizing and hydrating products,

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.040
including those

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.200
for skin repair,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.680
didn't really

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.320
help much.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.080
So there's something called

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.320
bifida ferment.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.800
What it mainly does is

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:37.960
to increase our skin's

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.960
metabolism,

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.000
while at the same time

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.200
it helps delay aging.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.280
It's impossible

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.880
that using any single product

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.280
can fix

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.720
all of

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.720
the skin problems.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.120
If any brands

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:50.720
claim that

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.080
after using their products,

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.120
you can go back to

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.160
how you looked

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:54.840
years ago,

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.240
it's either a scam

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.400
or the products contain hormones.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.040
Right, I remember things

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.240
about bifida ferment

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.680
and anti-aging.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.920
Yeah.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.960
From chemistry

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.240
background,

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.480
there are many things

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.960
I can explain to you.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.720
It's quite easy to understand.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.840
I think if I explain it,

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.480
it might be

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.600
somewhat helpful to you

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.680
about skincare.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.840
I just thought of something.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.880
Would you like to hear it?

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.360
Yes.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:17.920
Okay.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.520
Of course!

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.200
Hold on.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:36.800
Do you have a pen?

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:37.680
Thanks.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.120
This...

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.320
Bifida...

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.360
What's he going to talk about?

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.520
He's probably going to say

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.840
some chemistry equations

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.760
related to his major

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:57.680
and such.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.000
How long is he going to talk?

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.280
I should tell you all,

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.440
you only have one minute left.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.680
I know.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.280
Everyone knows

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.440
ceramide's

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.560
molecular formula

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.480
is quite complex

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.080
for ordinary people.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.120
I won't get into that.

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:10.639
I'll just explain

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:11.679
what you can understand.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.400
Through synthesis,

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.679
it reduces to

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:16.040
what's actually called

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:17.400
sphinganine.

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:19.520
Finally...

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:20.800
Lady Wan

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.000
seems to be losing interest.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:24.320
It's over.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:26.560
Fu Yudong...

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.719
Isn't this failing at the last hurdle?

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.040
Well, that's

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.040
basically it.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.159
If you have

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:46.440
any questions,

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.800
ask me anytime.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.880
I will

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.800
answer them online.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.920
Thank you. Thank you, Lady Wan.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:53.840
Well then...

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:54.840
Wait, Dr. Fu,

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.000
we haven't sold anything yet!

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:56.800
Come, sit down.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.720
Let's talk.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.080
Yes, we haven't sold anything yet.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.440
Did you use molecular formulas

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.640
to pursue your wife back then?

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.960
Don't be shy!

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.440
Who pursued whom first?

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.320
How did you meet?

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.760
We...

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.360
Weren't we supposed to be selling products?

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.480
Alright, let's sell first.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.600
Everyone, if you're

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.440
interested in Dr. Fu's story,

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.240
then please

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.640
show your support!

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.440
Three, two, one,

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.760
link is up!

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:36.920
Sold out instantly!

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:37.920
Sold out!

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.280
Dr. Fu, we've hit one thousand orders.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.200
Since our consumers are so supportive,

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:44.800
shouldn't you

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.960
answer the question from earlier?

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.160
Actually, there wasn't really

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.040
any pursuing between us.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.360
It just happened naturally.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.240
I don't believe that!

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.360
Look,

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.840
everyone wants you to tell the full story!

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.520
No, no, let's not...

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.320
Actually, I...

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.160
Weren't we here to sell products?

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.360
We've sold out.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.680
Let's leave that time for

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.800
other brands.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.520
Don't waste their time.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:10.800
Wait!

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.080
Mr. Li,

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.640
can we add another thousand orders?

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.680
No problem at all!

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.400
Alright, three, two, one,

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.120
link is up!

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.040
Looks like we can

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:20.920
chat a bit longer.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.640
Actually, when my wife and I

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.200
first met,

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.040
it was overseas.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:35.840
I came home

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.800
- from work that day. Then...
- The viewer count is rising.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.920
Right, right.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.120
I was about to have dinner

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.400
when I heard outside my window

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.400
very loud noise.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.680
I wondered what was going on.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.080
So I stuck my head out

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:45.880
and looked.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.800
Then I saw a girl

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.920
who was

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.920
arguing with a group of people.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.720
Those people were always

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.040
there.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:53.840
They had parties

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.240
until early hours

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.400
and didn't sleep,

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.000
making noise there every day.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.800
I wanted to complain about them,

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:00.920
but never dared to.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.840
Then at that moment,

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.160
[I suddenly saw this girl]

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.320
[rushing forward,]

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.440
[arguing with these people]

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.960
[for her rights.]

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.480
[I thought she was really brave]

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.560
[and impressive.]

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.200
Finally, I watched this girl

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.600
eloquently argued with the group

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.840
and drove them all away.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.120
Then I heard her voice,

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:16.800
and I thought...

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:18.760
Looking closer,

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.640
I somehow felt that

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.000
she isn't a foreigner.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.840
After their argument ended,

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.560
I went to talk to her and saw...

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.120
She is indeed Chinese,

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.240
a Chinese girl.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.640
I wanted to chat with her then.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.280
I really

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.440
admired her courage.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.920
Just as I was about to speak, she was bent over.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.960
When she looked up at me,

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.480
she was crying heavily.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.480
She kept crying.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.160
At first,

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.720
I asked what was wrong,

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.040
but she didn't speak.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.040
Then suddenly I understood.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.000
I could relate to her.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:50.760
I'll help you.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.120
I don't have money.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.240
It's so hard.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.360
You know, for people like us

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.160
who often live abroad.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.280
To be honest,

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.320
we often feel very lonely.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.760
Even though we

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.600
have work

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.720
and friends there,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.360
but no matter what,

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.160
in that kind of

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.480
environment,

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.360
you never quite feel like you belong,

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.200
and never feel like it's your home.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.840
Only when you return to China

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.800
you do realize,

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.320
"I'm home".

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.320
This is the first time our livestream

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.000
has sold so well without even

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.840
talking about the products.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.200
This is quite innovative.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:39.120
Then later,

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.600
I tried to comfort her.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.960
She didn't pay much attention.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.400
Before I left, she suddenly said

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.720
that it was her birthday.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.280
So I wondered what should I do.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.840
I said,

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.720
"I should get you

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.600
a cake

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.920
to celebrate."

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.040
Then I said,

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.760
"I might as well take you out

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.520
to buy a cake."

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.680
But those foreign stores,

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.600
well, you know,

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.200
they close very early every day.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:03.920
So that day,

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.320
we looked for a long time,

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.840
but couldn't find a single cake shop.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.160
Finally found one,

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.760
but they were just closing.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.400
What could we do?

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.480
We had to go back.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.840
After returning,

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.480
the more I thought about it,

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.560
the worse I felt.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.760
I felt I still needed to

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.560
do something for this girl.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.280
So then,

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.440
I took out a large rice cooker

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.800
and I cooked

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.080
a big pot of rice.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.840
I took that rice and

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.640
shaped it into

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.160
something like a cake.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.920
I thought we need a candle.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.560
Looked around the house and well,

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.960
no candles either.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.000
What to do?

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.840
So I took

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:38.960
some paper

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.600
and drew a candle.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.960
Then I took that candle

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.400
and stuck it in the rice.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.360
Then I held it with the candle

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.920
and sang "Happy Birthday to You".

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.560
That's how we met.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.680
Happy Birth...

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.640
What's your name?

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.400
Zhang Ran.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.240
Happy Birthday, Zhang Ran!

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.040
Blow out the candle!

00:39:58.880 --> 00:39:59.680
Did you make a wish?

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.480
No.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.560
Make a wish!

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.640
Ready, go!

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.480
Happy Birthday to you!

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.360
She was very touched at that moment.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.480
Then...

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.760
You live alone?

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.680
Let's try being together.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:17.640
Just like that.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.360
So she was the one who pursued you!

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.040
To tell you the truth,

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.600
when we were

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.320
driving on Toronto's streets late at night,

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.960
looking for a cake shop,

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.520
I think I had already fallen in love with her.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.960
And after all these years,

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.000
I actually

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.920
never told her this.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:45.680
You

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.160
won't broadcast this, right?

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.960
I used to think romantic dramas

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.320
were all fake.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.080
Never thought in real life

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.160
these things actually happen.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.880
Dr. Fu, you've really given us

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:56.880
a dose of romance!

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:57.960
Come on, everyone,

00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:58.760
if you're

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.200
interested in Dr. Fu's story

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.560
too...

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.720
Lady Wan,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.880
hit another thousand orders!

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.720
Dr. Fu, it seems everyone

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.040
wants to chat more with you.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:09.800
Mr. Li,

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.680
how much inventory do we have left?

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.840
Three thousand units.

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.200
Let's add three thousand more!

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.520
Link is up!

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.000
[Hearing Dr. Fu]

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.520
[share his story with his wife,]

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.640
[I was really moved.]

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.680
[It shows how much energy and love]

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.240
[Dr. Fu invested]

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.120
[in developing products.]

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.520
[I believe this sincerity...]

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.480
Alright!

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.640
This worked out unexpectedly well.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.280
The second half!

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.400
Let's go!

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.160
This time,

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.240
in Lady Wan's livestream,

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.680
we specially prepared

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.360
a carefully crafted limited edition.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.000
This is a newly updated design,

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.040
very exquisite.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.160
What we're bringing you

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.800
is a complete set from skincare to makeup,

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.920
everything included.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.480
Look what Xing Kai said!

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.200
I knew this would work out!

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.120
You did great, Yudong!

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:00.880
You know?

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.880
Sorry to interrupt,

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.800
do you both have time later?

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.400
Yes.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:07.920
After the livestream,

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.400
Lady Wan wants to talk with you.

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.360
- No problem.
- About what?

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.440
Why do you have so many questions?

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.400
We'll talk after.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.640
She probably

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.280
wants to continue to work with us.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.480
Why are you being so nosy?

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.360
You're happy, but I'm in trouble.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:27.480
What trouble?

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.840
Remember the cake thing?

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.720
Remember how badly I was criticized?

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.800
This time I'll probably be

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.720
criticized even worse.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.720
Impossible. Let me tell you,

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.760
times have changed!

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.680
Ms. Wang just told me

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.720
the livestream viewers

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.680
all really like you.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.320
I'm telling you,

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.960
Xing Kai is completely convinced now.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.040
[To tell you the truth,]

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:14.680
[when we were]

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.320
[driving on Toronto's streets late at night,]

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.960
[looking for a cake shop,]

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.520
[I think I had already fallen in love with her.]

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.920
[And after all these years,]

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.840
[I actually]

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.080
[never told her this.]

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.160
[You won't]

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.120
[broadcast this, right?]

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.000
What a coincidence

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.160
to meet you here!

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.840
Long time no see!

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:57.920
Didn't you say you don't want

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.840
me to talk about us in public?

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.800
But you told our story with passion,

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.160
even getting emotional.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.920
The National Husband.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.880
Then you must be

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.320
the National Wife.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:37.880
Oh, stop it.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:41.480
Alright!
