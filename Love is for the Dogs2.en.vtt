Could you do me a favor?

I have come to steal your dog.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.540
Come to think of it, ever since this morning...

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.070
It's finally the first date today.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.680
You're a wonderful owner.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.840
It's your first date with Shogun.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.250
Not mine with that guy, get it?

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.560
Let's go.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.340
- Morning.
- Good morning.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.110
Hey, Sakura.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.440
Good morning to you, Sakura.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.580
- I'll take over from here.
- What?

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.450
I'll let them play together for two hours.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.630
If you have other errands, you may leave first.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.890
I don't have any important errands. In fact, this is my errand.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.220
- Is that so.
- So of course, I'm tagging along.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.660
Just to make sure Sakura does okay.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.610
Sure. Then let's go.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.440

Feels bittersweet.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.310
This can also be considered Ms. Hanamura's first date.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.480
With Mr. Shirozaki?

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.010
- Blood sample for your analysis, please.
- Yes, sir.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.480
Mr. Shirosaki has never shown any interest in women.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.790
It's rare to hear him do this.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.740
- Not interested in women?
- No way. Not with all the shifts he's been doing.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.430
He's basically interested in nothing but animals.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.600
Still, guys like him are exactly the type
to have a long-term girlfriend.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.900
- So does he have one, or not?
- That remains a mystery.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.970
Well, he's still a good guy through and through,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.450
albeit a kind of ditsy one.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.260
- But I find him cool!
- Depends on how you see him.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.310
Want one?

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.680
Sure. Thanks.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.810
Wait... slow down. Go ahead.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.500
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.830
That's right. I already had a bad feeling about this.

We tried looking for him, and were about to give up

This is the article.
[Aspires to build the ideal "pet town" in Japan]

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.060
Thank you for taking such good care of Rocky.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.290
You should have told me right from the start.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.490
And would you have readily given Rocky to us?

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.690
I understand this will be hard for you,

Of course, we will pay you compensation.

- I want to ask his owner some questions.

There was no police report made when they got separated.

I want to know what kind of place he'll live in

No.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.090
That won't be necessary.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.830
It'll only make things more complicated.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.940
Rocky and his owner were only separated
for a short while.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.560
I'm only here to get him back.

You had three months, in accordance with Japanese law.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.460
Legally, a dog is considered as lost property.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.380
If its owner doesn't claim it in three months,

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.300
ownership is transferred to the one who found it.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.920
Even if you are the original owner,
you are not allowed to take matters into your own hands.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.450
In other words, forcibly taking the dog back right now

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.020
would constitute as theft.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.880
That's ridiculous.

Sir, isn't that...

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.790
The individual who will take care of that dog
will receive 50 billion won.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.400
50 billion won?

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.500
- In Japanese yen, it's...
- Around five billion yen.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.780
Five billion yen, for Shogun?

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.340
Aren't you in need of money, Doc?

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.980
I think this is not a bad offer.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.120
Please think about it.

If you'll excuse me.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.500
A conditional bequest.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.140
In short, someone left their inheritance

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.260
to the one who would take in, and care for Shogun.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.040
And that amounts to five billion yen.

I only planned to take temporary care of him.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.050
I should return him if the owner has been found.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.450
You'll give him back just like that?

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.740
Given my line of work,
I try not to let my emotions cloud my judgement.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.230
It's the compensation, right?

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.670

Right. Things kind of turned out this way.

This is bad. What will you do?

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.140
Hey, Ms. Aiko!

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.170
What shall I do? We don't seem to click.

This is how the chief addressed Mr. So Ha.

Not to worry. I'm good at driving.

I have a bad feeling

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.080
I was only checking the wipers.

So, where are we headed to?

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:20.810
For starters, let's have a nice chat while we drive around.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.130
Where did you get this car?

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.970
I bought it, to drive around Japan with you.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.040
You're kidding me.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.270
And please tell me everything you know about Mr. Shirosaki.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.520
What kind of person is he?

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:44.160
What exactly is it about me you "understand"?

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:50.050
I don't know him very well.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.500
What?

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.440
One thing's for sure, he's a very competent vet.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.710
He also has a great love for animals.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.410
Allergic dermatitis?

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:09.590
This is Ms. Iguchi. She is due to foster Harry.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.810
Doctor, what is "allergic dermatitis"?

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.390
Harry tested negative for feline AIDS and leukemia.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.720
His stool test was normal as well.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.900
Except... Sorry, I'll take over for a bit.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.150
You can see a bit of a rash here.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.160
I'll prescribe some medication to stop the itch.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:32.410
There are also hypo-allergenic options for food and shampoos available, so do give them a try.

These are for your reference.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:39.090
Will I be able to take good care of him?

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.870
You don't have to be an expert to do that.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:45.400
He may be a little jittery, but he's an obedient boy.

I made Harry's fosterer run away.

Don't be sorry. It was ultimately her choice.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.470
Keeping a pet requires care-taking costs, vet visits,

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.230
and a secondary guardian if you're not around.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:25.750
It's hard to keep one if you're not prepared for all that.

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:34.100
These are photos taken from the tourist spots we visited today.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:38.220
Since you couldn't take any more pictures halfway through,
I'm sending you some that I took.

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.980
Why's it suddenly blurry?

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.380
Jeez, they're so badly taken.

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:54.810
Not this one though. You look good here.

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:03.660
She's a strange lady indeed.

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:15.610
Where's Shogun?

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:16.990
Shogun!

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:18.290
I suddenly remembered.

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:19.720
It's been a while.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.920
I'll disappear.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:21.940
It's farewell.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.610
Bye bye, Rocky.
