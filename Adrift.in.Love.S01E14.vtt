00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:15.451

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:23.088
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:38.312
Mr. Zhang next door is reading your book.

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:41.690
He knows you're my son.

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:44.401
He wants your autograph.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:53.970
You broke up with Yue Jiao?

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.058
A few days ago, she called me out of the blue.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:01.603
She told me she couldn't come.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.837
She told me to take care of myself.

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:10.236
You can't force love.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.420
There's nothing wrong with not loving.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.890
If there's nothing wrong,
why didn't you tell Mom yourself?

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.523
Love can't be forced.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.063
That's right.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.566
You've never forced yourself to do anything.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:28.696
It's because you can't control yourself.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:33.343
The one who's not loved should let go.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:34.994
Right?

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:39.724
That's why you forced my mom
to jump off the building.

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:43.043
I wish you were the one who jumped that day.

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:53.113
I've hated you all my life.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.931
In the end, I became you.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.351
As long as there's no love,

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:03.206
the damage is already done.

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:05.451
It's no one's fault.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.337
I don't want you to end up like me,

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:12.489
punishing yourself with a lifetime of pain.

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:15.534
Hurting you two

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.972
is the biggest regret of my life.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.526
We made the same mistake.

00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:29.539
How could you expect us
to have a different ending?

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:32.986
Gu Jia Xin.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.238
Look at yourself.

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.567
You are my future.

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:41.244
I'm sorry.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.151
I'm sorry.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.436
I forgive you.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.690
Son.

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:04.267
[Reconciliation with the Self]

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.127
Only by creating a better future

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:12.132
can we truly make up for past regrets.

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:16.136
Do you remember your own words?

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.015
Your job is to give strength to others.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:26.022
This time, encourage yourself, too.

00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:24.250
[Episode 14: Did we find ourselves
in the aftermath of love?]

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.812
Hello, do you need help?

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:31.813
Hello.

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:32.897
Here's the thing.

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:35.066
A few months ago, I sold you a wedding dress.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:38.569
I'd like to ask if I can buy it back.

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.822
The styles from a few months ago

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:43.408
are probably all out of stock.

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:46.828
The wedding dress you want
is no longer in the shop.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.538
Would you like to look at other dresses?

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.707
We have many new designs.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.691
No, thank you.

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:57.779
It's fine. Let's go back to the previous shop.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:03.886
Excuse me, I'd like to know
where the discarded gowns go.

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:06.806
Well, let me check for you, okay?

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.582
Thank you.

00:05:18.524 --> 00:05:19.694
Forget it.

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:23.156
Even if you find it here,
you wouldn't want to wear it.

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.140
Why wouldn't I wear it if I find it?

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:33.374
Feel free to look around.
Prices are negotiable.

00:05:33.374 --> 00:05:35.692
Ma'am, I have a question.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:38.421
Is this wedding dress still in your shop?

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:39.922
It was sold by OURS.

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:41.924
This one?

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:43.258
We have so many wedding dresses.

00:05:43.258 --> 00:05:45.428
I'm not sure if it's still here.

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:47.764
How about you buy this one? Look.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:49.891
This floral one and this one.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.518
This is the latest one.

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.770
I'm sorry, but can I look for it?

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.939
Sure, take your time.

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.756
Thank you.

00:06:03.751 --> 00:06:07.362
Forget it. How are you going to find it
when there are so many?

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.692
It'll take you forever to find it.

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:23.966
I really don't understand
what you're so insistent about.

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:26.010
Why do you have to find that wedding dress?

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.513
If you think it's meaningless
and don't want to look, that's fine.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:30.414
You can go home first.

00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:32.580
No.

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:52.245
Just let her look for it.

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:55.331
If she can't find it,
she'll come back and choose.

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:56.541
Right?

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.875
Yes.

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.545
I really don't understand you two.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:03.697
I thought you'd be fine
once your mom is no longer involved.

00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:14.461
[I'm going to Nepal next week.]
[Come if you have time. No pressure.]

00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:18.720
Lin Feng Hua.

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:26.053
What's up? Are we going to Nepal for fun?

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.448
Fun? Are you crazy?

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.599
There was at least a kiss, right?

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.997
Damn, you really kissed?

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:38.875
Caught you in the act, huh. And then?

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:41.485
What do you mean? Nothing happened.

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.549
A girl like Lin Feng Hua
just threw herself at you,

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.867
and you could still hit the brakes.

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:51.620
You're really something.

00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:55.057
But let me ask you this.

00:07:55.057 --> 00:07:58.102
If you had met Lin Feng Hua before Xin Tong,

00:07:58.102 --> 00:08:00.212
would you be with her?

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:05.985
Maybe.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.761
Really?

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:11.598
Maybe she's more suitable
for you than Xin Tong.

00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:18.015
Perhaps.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:23.085
But you wouldn't break up
with Xin Tong over this, right?

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:26.363
Of course not. We're getting married.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:32.887
So, according to you,

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:36.706
being responsible is more important
than being compatible?

00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:02.667
Madam.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:03.751
It's you again?

00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.586
You really won't give up?

00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:08.172
I'm sorry, but I want to keep looking.

00:09:08.172 --> 00:09:10.800
You looked all day yesterday
and searched my entire shop.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.301
If you couldn't find it,
it must have been sold.

00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:14.345
No, maybe I didn't look carefully enough.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:15.972
I'll just look for a bit. It'll be quick.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:17.463
Thank you.

00:09:18.432 --> 00:09:22.586
I really don't understand
why that dress is so important to you.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.578
Miss.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:22.121
Miss.

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:23.623
I remember now.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.833
This dress was really sold.

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:27.918
Back then, a musical theater troupe...

00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:29.170
Look.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.421
They bought it as a costume.

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:32.798
They even asked us to help
put up posters for promotion.

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:34.443
Is this the one?

00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:17.367
Why aren't you going up?

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.581
I'm spending time with my thoughts.

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:25.083
What are you thinking about?

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:36.177
Let's take a walk.

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:59.768
Have you thought about our future?

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:07.000
We can have two children.

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.980
If it's too tiring, we can just have one.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:16.343
And then, we'll live happily ever after.

00:12:16.343 --> 00:12:18.880
Do you think this is a fairy tale?

00:12:19.947 --> 00:12:22.408
Don't idol dramas always end here?

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:24.618
What else?

00:12:24.618 --> 00:12:26.779
What kind of future do you envision?

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:31.329
I used to imagine many versions.

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:37.322
But lately, I can't see them as clearly.

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:42.762
I think you're just too tired
from planning the wedding.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.346
Let's go.

00:12:44.346 --> 00:12:46.891
Let's go home early.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.583
Yi Fu.

00:12:55.249 --> 00:12:56.588
You have to try on wedding dresses tomorrow,

00:12:56.588 --> 00:12:58.611
and there are a lot of alterations.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.387
We're pressed for time.

00:13:01.238 --> 00:13:03.139
Xin Yi Fu.

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:08.728
Let's cancel the wedding.

00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:13.125
Apologize to your mom for me.

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:15.232
I want to apologize to you, too.

00:13:21.842 --> 00:13:23.535
Why?

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.539
Is it because you haven't found
the wedding dress you want?

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:33.795
From the moment I decided to get married,

00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:37.340
everything went wrong.

00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:41.362
I can tell my mom to stay out of it.

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.988
I'll let you decide everything.

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:46.057
- Is that okay?
- This isn't about your mom.

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:52.105
It's about me?

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:56.877
If I've done anything wrong, I can change.

00:13:56.877 --> 00:13:58.879
You can tell me.

00:13:58.879 --> 00:14:02.341
But it's not so serious that
we can't get married.

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:05.744
Do you really think we can be happy together?

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:15.980
I always thought love wouldn't change
as long as I tried hard enough.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.536
But I didn't expect it to be me
who changed in the end.

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:37.025
So...

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.363
You don't love me anymore?

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.221
You said ending a relationship
at the best time is the most beautiful.

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:51.539
I realized you were right.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.544
Love is so strange.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:01.692
Passion comes out of nowhere,

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:04.543
but it leaves calmly and secretly.

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:19.275
- Let's...
- Let's say goodbye before love disappears.

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:26.282
Can we...

00:15:28.844 --> 00:15:31.037
not break up?

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:41.538
Let's not lie to ourselves, all right?

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:46.678
I just said it before you did.

00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:19.126
At least we made it through three months.

00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:24.950
We successfully broke your jinx.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.304
I guess I'm special and unique.

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:34.941
Thank you for giving me good memories.

00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:40.051
Thank you for helping me love myself again.

00:17:27.963 --> 00:17:30.490
We both tried.

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.836
We really tried.

00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:00.979
You're closed today?

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:05.417
I'm tired.

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:08.324
I'm done. I want to rest.

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:15.081
Why the sudden decision?

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.080
Where can I find you in the future?

00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:25.437
I just don't want you to find me.

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:27.034
Why not?

00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:30.675
Why not?

00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:36.723
You always come here and rant about your life.

00:18:38.158 --> 00:18:41.227
I get stressed, too, Miss.

00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:47.525
What's wrong with you? Are you drunk?

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:52.714
Stop drinking. Come on, I'll take you home.

00:18:52.714 --> 00:18:53.799
Stop drinking.

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.219
I'm not done yet. Sit down.

00:18:55.219 --> 00:18:58.206
- I don't want to hear your drunk talk.
- Sit down.

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:05.054
Okay, tell me what you want to say.

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:08.605
Every time you come here,

00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:11.591
you try to seek comfort from me.

00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:16.530
That's enough. It's been almost 20 years.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.074
I think I've done enough.

00:19:19.074 --> 00:19:22.535
I think this is enough for our fate.

00:19:25.372 --> 00:19:29.251
If you're unhappy, I'll just be your customer.

00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:31.044
I'll drink my soup and eat my noodles.

00:19:31.044 --> 00:19:32.756
I won't bother you. Is that okay?

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:34.915
It's not like that.

00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:37.801
When I see you,

00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:40.971
I care about you, I worry about you.

00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:43.724
I wonder if you're happy, if you're joyful.

00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:46.476
Will you get arrested by the police again?

00:19:46.476 --> 00:19:48.604
I...

00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:50.689
I don't want that.

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.901
I don't want to do that.

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:55.444
It's been over 20 years.
Why do you suddenly want to change?

00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:58.030
Can't you continue to care about me?

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.115
Don't you know Gu Hou Ze just left me?

00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:02.350
Are you going to ditch me?

00:20:05.954 --> 00:20:07.688
Zhou Xiao Qi.

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:12.920
Yes, he left you, and I'm leaving you, too.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.632
No one can stay with anyone forever.

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:19.426
It's the same for the baby in your tummy.

00:20:19.426 --> 00:20:22.221
It'll stay with you for 10 to 20 years at most.

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.848
The child has to live their own life.

00:20:24.848 --> 00:20:26.516
What about you?

00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:29.144
Aren't you going to live your life
alone from now on?

00:20:29.144 --> 00:20:31.796
Just like me.

00:20:32.981 --> 00:20:36.526
You used to be so brave.

00:20:36.526 --> 00:20:41.347
Love turned you into this.

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.854
Zhou Xiao Qi, I'll be serious.

00:20:49.873 --> 00:20:53.043
No matter what difficulties
you face in the future,

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:54.253
remember this.

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:55.797
The way you plucked up your courage

00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:59.675
and asked me for a bowl of noodles.

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:02.804
That Zhou Xiao Qi is invincible.

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:05.206
I don't want you like this.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.340
The fish soup will be ready soon.

00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:14.822
Coming right up. Fish soup.

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.750
Ma'am.

00:22:34.227 --> 00:22:36.504
Can I have a bowl of noodles?

00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:45.364
I haven't eaten for days.

00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:47.866
There's no milk for the baby.

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:50.434
The baby has been starving.

00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:55.248
Ma'am.

00:22:55.248 --> 00:22:57.250
I can do anything for you.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.293
Anything.

00:22:58.293 --> 00:23:01.588
Sweep, wash dishes, wash vegetables, mop.

00:23:01.588 --> 00:23:04.977
I can do anything.
I'm not afraid of being tired, Ma'am.

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:11.973
Ma'am, give me a bowl of noodles.

00:23:11.973 --> 00:23:14.333
I want to feed my baby.

00:23:26.363 --> 00:23:30.659
Sis, I want miso soup, chicken,
and shredded bamboo shoots today.

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:32.663
- Okay.
- One order.

00:23:32.663 --> 00:23:33.872
Ma'am.

00:23:33.872 --> 00:23:35.789
Ma'am.

00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:39.209
Shredded bamboo shoots, chicken, and miso soup.

00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:41.694
Okay, coming.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.592
You have a grandchild now?

00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:50.011
So lucky.

00:23:50.011 --> 00:23:52.246
Good girl.

00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:57.093
Here, help yourself to the chicken.

00:24:04.403 --> 00:24:06.763
Here, be careful.

00:24:33.932 --> 00:24:35.666
How are you?

00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:38.793
Not good.

00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:44.232
I know.

00:24:44.232 --> 00:24:46.526
It's even worse when I see you.

00:24:46.526 --> 00:24:48.904
I thought I was pitiful enough.

00:24:48.904 --> 00:24:52.117
I didn't expect myself to be
even more pitiful at 35.

00:24:52.117 --> 00:24:56.394
Adults say things will get better
in the future, but it's all a lie.

00:24:59.247 --> 00:25:01.249
I'm sorry.

00:25:01.249 --> 00:25:03.043
I've disappointed you.

00:25:03.043 --> 00:25:05.962
Can you try harder to live a better life?

00:25:05.962 --> 00:25:09.156
At least give me some hope for the future.

00:25:10.592 --> 00:25:12.993
Otherwise, how can I go on?

00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:17.039
I'm working hard.

00:25:17.974 --> 00:25:20.852
You keep coming to see me.
How are you trying hard?

00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:22.354
That's because I want to save you.

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:25.047
Can you save yourself first?

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.198
I want to.

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:35.367
But I don't know how.

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:38.436
I was braver than you when I was 17.

00:25:40.413 --> 00:25:42.231
I hate you.

00:26:07.969 --> 00:26:09.067
Hou Ze.

00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:15.031
By the time you get this letter,
I'll have left you.

00:26:15.031 --> 00:26:16.616
Hou Ze.

00:26:16.616 --> 00:26:20.328
I never thought I'd have to
say goodbye to you like this.

00:26:20.328 --> 00:26:22.313
Hou Ze.

00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:06.148
Can I make an appointment?

00:27:12.714 --> 00:27:14.823
I'm almost done here.

00:27:17.093 --> 00:27:19.510
I can't see patients anymore.

00:27:20.349 --> 00:27:22.583
I want to finish my story.

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:42.226
It's true that I was raped by the senior
I had a crush on in high school.

00:28:00.929 --> 00:28:02.830
Are you Zhou Xiao Qi?

00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:09.378
I heard you like me.

00:28:14.442 --> 00:28:16.028
Come on.

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:31.543
What are you doing? Don't you like me?

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:34.421
- Don't you like me?
- Senior, no!

00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:36.506
- I'm here.
- No!

00:28:36.506 --> 00:28:38.633
I don't want to!

00:28:38.633 --> 00:28:40.492
I don't want to!

00:28:44.055 --> 00:28:45.306
Don't run!

00:28:45.306 --> 00:28:46.641
Don't do this!

00:28:46.641 --> 00:28:48.500
I don't want to!

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.491
From that moment on,

00:29:03.491 --> 00:29:07.061
my fantasies and expectations
about love disappeared.

00:29:20.508 --> 00:29:23.094
I didn't even have time to be afraid

00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:25.412
when I found out I was pregnant.

00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:28.916
At that time, I tried everything

00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:32.252
to kill the baby in my womb.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.799
I thought she ruined my life.

00:30:11.061 --> 00:30:13.353
But no matter how hard I tried,

00:30:13.353 --> 00:30:15.462
I didn't succeed.

00:30:16.564 --> 00:30:18.589
I guess it was fate.

00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:23.112
So, I dropped out of school and had her.

00:30:23.112 --> 00:30:25.681
Then I worked part-time to make money

00:30:26.783 --> 00:30:29.443
to raise my daughter, Duo Duo.

00:30:33.456 --> 00:30:35.816
I was only 17 at the time.

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:42.698
Girls my age were all worried
about dating and boyfriends.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.456
I was the only one.

00:30:46.928 --> 00:30:50.557
I was the only one worried that
my child wouldn't have enough to eat.

00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:52.433
I was still a child, too.

00:30:52.433 --> 00:30:55.043
Why did I have to suffer?

00:30:58.064 --> 00:31:01.025
I didn't even know what love was.

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:03.069
I had never been in love.

00:31:03.069 --> 00:31:05.804
And I was never loved by my parents.

00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:11.143
But on that day,

00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:14.750
I looked at Duo Duo.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.358
When she looked at me,

00:31:21.045 --> 00:31:23.489
it was like I was her whole world.

00:31:25.091 --> 00:31:28.535
I could feel her love running so deep.

00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:32.348
That was when I realized that love

00:31:32.348 --> 00:31:34.416
can make someone

00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:37.044
so happy,

00:31:38.521 --> 00:31:40.672
so content.

00:31:43.449 --> 00:31:45.925
I must have done a lot of
bad things in my past life.

00:31:51.618 --> 00:31:54.144
The only love I ever felt

00:31:56.706 --> 00:31:58.082
was taken away just like that.

00:31:58.082 --> 00:32:00.859
Duo Duo.

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:06.990
Duo Duo.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.122
Duo Duo.

00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:20.921
Duo Duo.

00:32:35.828 --> 00:32:37.521
Duo Duo.

00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:45.338
Duo Duo.

00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:47.548
Duo Duo.

00:32:47.548 --> 00:32:49.283
Duo Duo.

00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:02.563
That morning,

00:33:02.563 --> 00:33:04.840
she was clearly smiling at me.

00:33:08.611 --> 00:33:11.722
How could she just stop breathing?

00:33:19.038 --> 00:33:21.273
After so many years,

00:33:22.959 --> 00:33:25.861
I still can't forget that day.

00:33:32.218 --> 00:33:34.762
Actually, I'm not here today

00:33:34.762 --> 00:33:37.873
to ask for your forgiveness or sympathy.

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.537
I just want you to know

00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:47.608
that besides Duo Duo,

00:33:47.608 --> 00:33:49.936
you're the only one who made me feel love.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.740
Thank you for helping me

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:58.852
move on from the cage of my 17-year-old self.

00:34:02.123 --> 00:34:03.630
Thank you.

00:34:18.473 --> 00:34:20.707
I'll send your medical records

00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:23.502
to another doctor.

00:34:46.712 --> 00:34:49.030
I'm going to be a mom again.

00:34:56.677 --> 00:34:58.912
Can I use this name?

00:35:00.473 --> 00:35:03.917
You named her with a father's heart.

00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:07.921
That love truly existed.

00:35:09.232 --> 00:35:12.467
So, I want to give this name to my child.

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:15.637
Can I?

00:35:16.989 --> 00:35:18.580
Why do that?

00:35:25.414 --> 00:35:27.482
Thank you for loving me.

00:35:29.418 --> 00:35:31.039
I was very happy.

00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:34.114
Take care.

00:36:18.968 --> 00:36:20.928
Xiao Qi.

00:36:20.928 --> 00:36:22.579
Xiao Qi.

00:36:30.313 --> 00:36:32.130
Let's get married.

00:38:09.203 --> 00:38:11.205
Okay, you're not eating anymore?

00:38:11.205 --> 00:38:13.522
No, I didn't get it.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.781
Okay, come on.

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:27.847
Daddy, wake up.

00:38:27.847 --> 00:38:29.915
Fei Fei, wake Daddy up.

00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:36.421
The weather is so nice.

00:38:37.206 --> 00:38:41.158
Let's take Daddy for a walk
on the beach next time, okay?

00:38:41.158 --> 00:38:43.070
Let's wake Daddy up.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:46.115
Daddy, wake up, lazybones!

00:38:46.115 --> 00:38:48.391
Lazybones!

00:38:49.702 --> 00:38:52.038
Do you want Mommy to read you a story?

00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:53.519
All right.

00:38:54.415 --> 00:38:56.125
Let's see.

00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:58.919
It's your favorite.

00:38:58.919 --> 00:39:01.130
Bunny, look.

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:04.991
Bunny's birthday. Happy birthday.

00:39:07.053 --> 00:39:08.387
Turn the page.

00:39:08.387 --> 00:39:11.682
Look. Bunny is sleeping, right?

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:13.642
And then, his parents

00:39:13.642 --> 00:39:16.878
came to look for Bunny with a present.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.398
Are you a bunny, too?

00:39:19.398 --> 00:39:21.150
A bunny?

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:22.717
You are?

00:39:24.779 --> 00:39:27.365
Yes, look, there's a present.

00:39:27.365 --> 00:39:30.350
Mommy has a present for you, Bunny.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.199
Pan Xin Tong.

00:39:46.801 --> 00:39:48.552
Open the door.

00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:50.287
Come in.

00:40:13.536 --> 00:40:16.027
Sorry, the house is a mess. Have a seat.

00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:20.629
I brought Fei Fei a present.

00:40:20.629 --> 00:40:25.548
You're finally back.

00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:27.800
Congratulations on giving birth.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.993
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:40:35.057 --> 00:40:37.601
These are all toys for Fei Fei.

00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:39.061
Thanks.

00:40:39.061 --> 00:40:41.921
She has a lot of toys. Don't buy any more.

00:40:43.649 --> 00:40:44.850
You were in Vietnam for a year.

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:47.427
It must have been tough, Vice President Pan.

00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:51.198
It wasn't easy.

00:40:51.198 --> 00:40:53.933
Can it be more tiring than being a mother?

00:40:57.037 --> 00:40:59.707
How are you? Do you have a boyfriend?

00:40:59.707 --> 00:41:01.208
Of course not.

00:41:01.208 --> 00:41:03.777
I only focused on work.

00:41:04.378 --> 00:41:06.508
Okay.

00:41:06.508 --> 00:41:10.134
You've accumulated
a lot of achievements in Vietnam.

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:13.304
Do you want to come back to
the Taipei headquarters as Vice President?

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:15.747
You can push the company to go public.

00:41:17.352 --> 00:41:20.102
I want to stay in Vietnam for a few more years.

00:41:20.102 --> 00:41:21.562
I thought I wouldn't last three months.

00:41:21.562 --> 00:41:24.482
I can't believe a year has passed.

00:41:24.482 --> 00:41:28.635
Actually, I quite enjoy striving alone
in an unfamiliar environment.

00:41:32.573 --> 00:41:34.182
All right.

00:41:39.371 --> 00:41:41.022
How about you?

00:41:41.749 --> 00:41:43.483
Are you okay?

00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:46.378
I'm fine.

00:41:46.378 --> 00:41:48.321
I have everything.

00:42:05.397 --> 00:42:06.565
Miss, do you have a reservation?

00:42:06.565 --> 00:42:07.983
No. Do you have a table for one?

00:42:07.983 --> 00:42:10.343
Yes, we do. This way, please.

00:42:14.615 --> 00:42:16.766
Please take a look at the menu.

00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:25.334
Here's your meat.

00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:27.026
Thank you.

00:42:49.984 --> 00:42:51.110
All right.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.612
You guys book a private room.
I'll go pay first.

00:42:52.612 --> 00:42:54.029
Okay, I'll book it.

00:42:54.029 --> 00:42:55.489
Okay.

00:42:55.489 --> 00:42:57.557
Let's see if there's anything nearby.

00:43:07.501 --> 00:43:09.003
Long time no see.

00:43:09.003 --> 00:43:10.713
Long time no see.

00:43:10.713 --> 00:43:11.964
What a coincidence!

00:43:11.964 --> 00:43:16.468
You can now eat spicy hot pot by yourself.

00:43:16.468 --> 00:43:20.121
I later found out that eating it alone
is quite relaxing.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:23.350
How about you? How have you been?

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:24.351
Good.

00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:26.353
I've been assigned to the Vietnam branch.

00:43:26.353 --> 00:43:28.355
I'm back for a few days.

00:43:28.355 --> 00:43:30.524
Expat assignment? You got a promotion!

00:43:30.524 --> 00:43:31.966
Yes.

00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:35.428
How about you? How's work?

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.698
It's about the same.

00:43:37.698 --> 00:43:39.700
I'm still at Snobis.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.327
How's life?

00:43:41.327 --> 00:43:44.622
Did you end up with Director Lin's daughter?

00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:46.415
Lin Feng Hua?

00:43:46.415 --> 00:43:48.626
We were a couple, but not anymore.

00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:50.127
How come?

00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:51.879
I thought she was a good match for you.

00:43:51.879 --> 00:43:53.464
You know.

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:55.156
Three months.

00:43:56.091 --> 00:43:57.301
Mr. Xin.

00:43:57.301 --> 00:43:59.219
The private room is booked.
We'll wait for you downstairs.

00:43:59.219 --> 00:44:00.596
Okay.

00:44:00.596 --> 00:44:02.765
Well, that's all for now.
This hot pot is on me.

00:44:02.765 --> 00:44:04.975
- You don't have to.
- Why not?

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:07.102
We haven't seen each other for over a year.

00:44:07.102 --> 00:44:09.170
It's rare to run into you here.

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:13.817
Keep in touch.

00:44:13.817 --> 00:44:16.469
Yes, let's keep in touch.

00:44:17.404 --> 00:44:19.138
I'll pay first.

00:44:20.949 --> 00:44:26.121
