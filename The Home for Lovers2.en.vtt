WEBVTT

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.030
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.820
Watching the sea?

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.570
What else is there to do?

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.490
I am curious about Ai-san

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.520
I've only seen two faces.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.770
Arrogant and helpless.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.610
- Who's helpless?
- Just saw the third, angry face.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.380
I'm going back.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.940
Not eating the shells.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.980
I changed my mind.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.080
Leave me alone.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.620
Can't do that.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.130
I'm a professional guide.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.740
Taking care of you and reading your mood is my job.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.440
Help you bathe.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.240
Wash your hair.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.310
You came to the island

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.070
to write a novel, right?

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.920
So what?

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.890
I'll show you around this island.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.180
Not just the sea

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.650
I know everything on land, too.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.120
Reassuring, right?

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.400
But I didn't ask you

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.560
I already got paid by the editor.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.880
Take money, do work.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.280
If I can't do it

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.120
I have to refund.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.150
Really?

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.660
Then refund it now.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.680
But...

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.830
I already turned down other jobs for this.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.820
Might not have work now.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.210
By the way.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.720
No car rental on the island, only scooters.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.090
Without me

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.700
you can't go anywhere.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.520
I'm your

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.290
babysitter and guide.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.870
And also...

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.770
Want to add any other options?

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.590
Up to you.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.350
I think I kinda want it.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.540
Even if you were the last man on earth.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.590
Absolutely no way.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.510
Let's eat the shells.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.850
Good food calms anger.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.010
Open your mouth.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.270
Eat with your hands

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.370
I already washed them.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.970
Dip your hands in the sea.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.380
- That's not the same as washing.
- Seawater kills germs.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.500
It's delicious, eat up.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.670
Please.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.000
You know?

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.910
What I wanted to do when we first met?

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.400
Annoy me or something like that.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.690
I really wanted to know

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.810
what these little lips

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.380
taste like.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.600
Want to know?

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.500
Ouch.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.860
Let me see.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.730
Gentle.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.940
Cut by shell fragments.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.510
Be careful when I'm not around.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.420
No next time

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.980
I'll get disinfectant.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.050
Need to find someone tonight.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.200
"Love Sea The Home for Lovers"
(Episode 2)

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.010
Please.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.110
Answer the phone.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.880
Please pick up the phone.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.520
Hello.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.620
This is Ai Rakumoto.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.480
Hello.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.800
Please tell Himeka-san to stop ordering me around

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.140
I currently cannot take calls.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.170
Please contact Secretary Fumi

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.600
if anything happens.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.560
What to do.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.720
I just have to go.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.160
Took 30 minutes to prepare yourself?

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.550
Why?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.640
I just have to go.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.070
Go and it's solved.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.350
Start and it'll end

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.430
whatever it is.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.880
You must be tired.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.050
Come rest inside.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.790
Ah.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.930
But.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.520
Light bulb.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.080
I just came to change the bulb

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.340
I'll leave right after.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.820
The novelist won't answer calls, such a free secretary.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.410
Supporting his writing.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.310
It is my job.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.080
Is he even writing?

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.440
Probably still sleeping.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.430
Maybe sleeping with someone.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.320
He isn't that kind of person.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.510
Anyway, just come in.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.490
Excuse me.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.630
It hurts.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.480
Be gentle.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.960
Alright, it's done.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.380
Still hurts.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.630
Pain, pain, go away

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.880
I'm not a child.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.250
You make such a fuss over a tiny cut.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.470
Just a tiny...

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.010
Then a different spell.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.240
My hands... are dirty.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.800
Does Ai-san have dirty parts?

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.380
I want to

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.640
sleep with you.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.650
Here

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.360
is the bed.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.160
Open your mouth.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:51.810
I want to keep going.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.000
Ah! Wait.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.300
Kaishinn.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.340
Take me back to the inn now.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:46.600
What?

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.630
My technique has gotten rusty.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.810
Popular with women.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.190
Such an cute side.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.310
Be quiet.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.510
Okay.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.610
Touching your shoulder.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.150
Reminds me of someone.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:03.750
Turn on the light please.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.090
It's on.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.870
Great.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:11.440
Well then

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.520
I'm heading back.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:17.800
Wait.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.190
What is it?

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.670
The light is on already.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.350
Such a messy room.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.660
You're leaving me here?

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.000
Huh?

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.820
This is Himeka-san's house.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.310
Can't help it.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.420
Nonstop filming.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.620
Didn't Ai tell you?

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.880
I'm a woman who can't do anything

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.220
I've heard of it.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.370
But I need to memorize lines.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.410
Hope you'll help me rehearse.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.440
I can't do that

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.200
I'm just an amateur.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:02.910
Then.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.800
Fumi.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.880
What can you help me with?

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:47.480
Okay.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:55.530
Hmm?

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.630
It's mine.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.030
I want to clean around the sofa, too.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.810
Well

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.810
I'll be in my room, call if needed.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.170
What's that?

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:08.650
Fire-resistant Stone.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:13.560
Rare stone formed by island's volcanic eruption.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.930
Soft and light, yet very strong.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.580
Wow.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:20.940
Here.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.680
Ai-san.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.150
Really.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:33.740
This heart

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:35.490
is really super light.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.290
But very strong.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.620
Oh, right.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.180
Let me show you something nice.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.120
Too tight?

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:56.450
Very tight.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:58.820
Bear with it.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.750
Let's go.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.730
Get on.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:10.980
Wait...

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.350
This outer wall is all made of fire-resistant stone, too.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.800
(Sandy Path)

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.620
Nice, right?

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.700
Yeah.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.390
This statue is, too.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.020
Huh?

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.440
Is this graffiti?

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.950
Yeah.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:59.590
Because it's soft and easy to carve,
tourists used to scratch it up.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.350
Not only fire-resistant stone

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.240
but also everything on the island is precious.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.120
I want to protect them from harm.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.860
We're here.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.000
Not getting off?

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.980
It hurts.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.500
Where?

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.590
Where does it hurt?

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.880
Ow!

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.620
My butt.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.040
My butt hurts.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:42.910
Your riding is rough.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.950
I'll be gentle tonight (dialect)

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:50.910
Huh?

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.660
Island people might see.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:16:59.970
Scared?

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.580
Of being seen with a man.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:03.190
No.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.210
I'm not hiding.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:06.810
But.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.570
Kaishin is a local, right?

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.680
I don't care what others think.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:13.410
I see.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:17.520
However

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:18.980
what did you just say.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:21.730
I said.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:27.890
I'll be gentle tonight.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.640
It... hurts...

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.500
Delicious.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.220
Right?

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.890
Island specialty, red curry with black curry.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.050
Specialty.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.130
Hmm?

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.280
On the first day, your brother

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:03.540
told me.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.770
The island specialty is Kaishin.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.640
Ham said something dumb again.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:15.480
- Wasn't wrong though.
- Even Amy-san is teasing me.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.360
No.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.450
You love this island, and the sea.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.490
Environmental and linguistic, all is completely self-taught.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.020
Weird, right?

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.900
Still teasing me.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.780
You've got various certifications

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.500
made the tourists happy.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.920
We benefit a lot.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.340
What supports this place is the food.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.340
That's true, too.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.010
Geez.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.540
Suddenly want to show off.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:44.700
What do you want to eat?

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.800
Island-style Peperoncino.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:47.620
Want island-style?

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.710
After eating my island-style pasta, you won't want anything else.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:53.930
Be prepared.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.100
Thanks.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.150
Huh.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.820
Staring like that, are you in love?

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.290
When did you start guiding?

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:05.600
Hmm.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.970
It started at 15

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.310
15 years old?

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.400
Amazing.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.210
Do your parents do it, too?

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.370
No.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.720
I fought with my parents

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.200
and left home at 15, cut ties with them.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.690
Huh?

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:25.260
So.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:26.580
Not just a tour guide

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.260
I do anything that pays

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.460
to survive.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.510
Amy said nice things in front of customers.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.920
She even lent me money

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.090
at the day I got certified.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.160
You probably think I'm pitiful.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.650
If Ai-san thinks so, then I really am.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.350
But I don't see it that way myself.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.940
I don't think so either.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:55.910
Thank you.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.490
Why did Ai-san become a writer?

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.110
Because it was fun.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.520
At first.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.910
I wanted to share things I liked

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.470
with others.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.060
Now?

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.210
Well.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:18.710
As readers increased

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.980
some started to criticizing.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:22.780
"This setting is weird."

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.310
"Not well thought out, what's the motivation?"

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.060
Does Princess Kaguya need a reason to be born from bamboo?

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.720
That's the world of creation.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:34.470
Is your current work fulfilling?

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.130
Otherwise, there wouldn't be a writer Ai Rakumoto.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.680
Amazing.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:44.580
You're amazing.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.360
Never been praised me like that

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.420
I'll praise you.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.050
I think Kaishin is amazing, too.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.820
Really a specialty.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:01.360
Hey.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.660
Eat up.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:05.320
It'll get cold.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.140
Delicious.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:11.820
So delicious.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.000
So cute.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.590
(Dialect)

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.350
Hmm?

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.390
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:41.960
Himeka-san

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.630
I've washed 3 weeks' worth of clothes

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.360
and vacuumed

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.860
I'll take my leave now.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.930
Wait.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.180
Don't tell me I have to wash dishes, too.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.720
Already washed.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.510
Stomach.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.330
Himeka-san.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:07.960
Are you okay?

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:09.470
Himeka-san.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.660
I'm hungry.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:18.860
I only had water and an apple.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.160
Order delivery

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:21.920
I don't have strength to pick up phone.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.020
No energy to even go get it.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.270
But you still have strength to pull my arms.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:44.740
I understand

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.600
I'll order delivery

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.230
I'll leave once it arrives.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:52.750
What do you want? Let's eat together.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.390
Order for two.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:17.430
Okay.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.750
This time

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.220
I really have to go now.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.990
Wait.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.910
Is there anything else?

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.250
Light bulbs, laundry, cleaning.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.000
I'm not Himeka-san's servant.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.050
Ai is better.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:37.850
He orders his own delivery.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.970
Fumi.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.070
No other requests.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.290
Just want to give you a reward.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.490
A reward.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.240
Don't tell me it's cleaning toilets.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.690
The reward for an excellent secretary

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.280
is a kiss from the leading lady.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:32.550
Bye!

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.530
Why the sudden heavy rain?

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.650
Island gets sudden showers.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.790
Taking shelter here?

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.060
- Let me borrow the shower.
- Ok.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.340
Clean clothes with bigger size are left outside.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.390
Viewing requires a fee.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.050
The service in day

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.000
was not for free.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:00.730
How much?

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.750
How much was it for that in day?

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.140
How much to sleep with you once?

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:26.420
Being violated by you.

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.260
How much do I have to pay for it?

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.710
How much would it cost to have you?

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.550
I'm expensive.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.000
I can afford it.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:20.470
You're good at biting.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.880
It feels so good.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.590
Condom

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.490
in my bag.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:22.180
Which way did you toss?

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.270
Wait.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:45.460
Have you been staring too much?

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:48.170
Huh?

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.300
Lines.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.800
Give me a second

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.370
I need to use the restroom.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:58.660
Okay
