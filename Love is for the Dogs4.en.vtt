WEBVTT

00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.880
You're kidding me.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.140
Thank you for having me!

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.090
Hey, Shogun!

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.500
The two of us will protect you from now on, yeah?

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.010
- "The two of us"?
- Busy, busy...

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.530
There's more.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.320
In short, we'll be living together.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.800
We're living together?

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.030
I'll leave these here for now...

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.280
Hang on a sec.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.960
It's fine. I'll take this room.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.590
I won't say it's comfy, but it's good enough to sleep on.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.410
This is my bed.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.250
This isn't the guest room?

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.450
I can't do this. Living together is impossible!

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.600
Young master, I bought the things you wanted.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.260
- What's that?
- Thank you.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.190
- Let's go make some now.
- Make some...

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.780
- Here you go, Kai.
- Thanks.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.660
Now hold on.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.480
- Yum. This is good for breakfast.
- Don't talk like everything's settled.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.610
Why would a rich young master like you live in my house?

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.280
If you're going to stay in Japan,
you could have bought a penthouse or villa.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.340
Shogun's worth 50 billion won.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.140
That's five billion yen in inheritance.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.730
What will you do if he's kidnapped again?

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.420
Can you fight people off?

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.810
Can you box?

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.470
I'm also responsible for what happened to him.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.500
I want to help in any way I can.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.100
This is dak-gomtang made by Yeon Su.
[Simmered chicken in clear broth]

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.860
- The heck is that?
- Let's eat it later.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.280
That's my fridge, mind you...

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.800
It's all your fault.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.770
When he saw how attached you were to that dog...

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.490
I can't bring the dog back with me.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.720
Fine.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.520
Do what you want.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.890
"But don't ever come back."

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.100
"I don't need a useless son like you."

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.110
That was what his father said to him.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.750
That's why they cancelled his cards.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.800
Right now, he has no money or roof over his head.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.070
He's hiding all that from you.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.270
Seems like I'll have to learn how to do my laundry.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.440
Hey, I'll figure it out.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.560
Well then, I'm heading back to Seoul for now.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.140
What?

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.050
I'll speak with your family.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.480
There's still the legal paperwork to settle
even if we bring the dog back.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.490
I'm also hoping to check out the situation back home.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.370
Legal paperwork?

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.320
Mr. Kai, I'd suggest that you hire a lawyer as well.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.690
- Your wife is having an affair?
- That's right.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.440
The evidence is in here.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.810
Are these text messages from your wife?

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.940
It's from her secret account.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.130
I discovered it.
[Today's my wedding anniversary, and ex's birthday]

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.710
She goes on and on about her lingering feelings
for her ex-boyfriend.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.810
Ms. Hanamura, this counts as adultery, right?

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.280
Thank you for showing me this.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.050
Unfortunately, it'd be difficult filing for a compensation
or divorce

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.200
with the evidence you have.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.090
We can initiate a divorce negotiation or mediation,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.580
but if both parties can't mutually agree
and it goes to court,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.270
the divorce may not be approved.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.260
So please think it over very carefully.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.780
Having an affair in her heart, huh?

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.800
Sounds like it.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.700
But it's not like the wife is seeing her ex.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.070
She's only thinking of him, like a fan would an idol.
That's no sin, right?

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.230
I disagree. That's precisely why it's a sin.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.200
You secretly hide your feelings for someone,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.770
only to let them resurface at times for a quick savor.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.230
That's what they call true love.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.660
Whenever I came across a dog or dorayaki,
you would come to mind.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.800
It's been a while.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.440
Besides, she only thinks fondly of her ex

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.700
because the past is making him look better than he was.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.200
Fair point.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.870
Personally, I forget all about the guys I break up with.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.570
- What?
- You've had boyfriends?

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.280
Of course I have.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.640
I may not talk about it as much as others do,
but yes, I did go dating.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.470
- What?
- Nothing...

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.190
Ah, there you are.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.600
Ms. Hanamura, could I have a minute?

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.310
I will update you again.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.180
Please excuse me, sir.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.430
You're here, Ms. Hanamura.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.040
I've just finished my first meeting with President Woo.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.110
- He's a really charismatic man.
- You spoke with Mr. So Ha's father?

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.730
It seems he has some issues with Mr. So Ha.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.990
Pardon?

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.080
Mr. So Ha didn't bring the dog back,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.230
so he was kicked out of the WooRoA Group.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.870
- Is he allowed to stay?
- I've checked with my family.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.950
They told me to do whatever I want.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:51.520
If they end up battling it out
with the dog's current owner in court,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.560
we shall officially stand as an ally of the WooRoA Group.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.860
In other words, we will be going against Kai Shirosaki.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.530
Ms. Hanamura, I'd like you to be on our team.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.560
But sir, our dogs get along well with each other,
so there's a conflict of interest...

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.020
Ms. Hanamura. On one hand,
there are lawyers who make money.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.750
On the other, there are lawyers who help people.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.730
Now which will you choose to become?

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.880
- I will become a lawyer who helps...
- Both, Ms. Hanamura.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.710
If you're doing it, aim for both.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.020
You'll win the case for WooRoA,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.770
and you can quietly take care of Mr. So Ha
so he doesn't get into trouble.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.950
There, you've made your choice. You're welcome.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.110
I'll do what I can.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.540
The client we're representing is the WooRoA Group.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.470
Please don't forget that.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.110
Leave it to me.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.810
Thank you.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.850
Need carrying, don't you?

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.970
What just happened?

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.640
Is he a dream? Or an illusion?

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.870
A dazzling delusion.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.300
- Where shall I put this?
- Thank you. Let me get that.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.610
It's pretty crowded here today.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.800
What's wrong, cutie-pie?

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.740
Please handle her with care.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.470
This dog is from Ireland, and has an excellent pedigree.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.380
Her parents were both champions, so she doesn't come cheap.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.720
Hey, Mocha.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.760
It's Mocha Alexandra von Rich.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.630
Mocha... Aterirea Vich.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.810
Please come in.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.770
She has a fever and problems breathing.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.460
It might be bronchitis.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.670
- We'll have to do an X-ray, right?
- Yup.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.300
Mr. Shirosaki.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.940
We're saved, thanks to So Ha.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.480
What?

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.340
When did you start working here?

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.690
- Are you from Korea?
- What the...

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.120
- He's giving away this morning's samples...
- It's a new toothpaste gum.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.370
Please try it.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.950
Hey, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute!

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.350
- You're all so lovely, I couldn't help but give these to you.
- What?

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.730
I mean, these doggies.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:58.220
Kiki is done with her IV drip treatment.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.630
Ma'am? Kiki's owner?

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.620
What's going on here?

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.090
This is useless. He's no help at all.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:15.140
- He's helped us plenty.
- Thanks to him, everyone's relaxed while waiting.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.890
He's even livened up the waiting area.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.350
I just can't stand this guy!

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.740
Hi, Aiko.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.210
You came at the right time. I wanted to see you.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.940
Huh?

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:32.900
[Morning consultation has ended]

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.770
- Please take care of her.
- No problem.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.770
- I'll come back for her later.
- Sure.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.030
- Thank you.
- We'll take care of her.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.890
I'm fired on my first day of work?

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.240
Why? I didn't do anything wrong.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.280
Why in tarnation, Kai?
[So Ha is speaking in Kansai dialect here]

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.660
I'm sorry, but you're as chaotic as a green anole.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.220
Green... what?

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.420
An invasive lizard that was brought into the Ogasawara Islands.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.980
Lizard? Me?

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.350
You wanted to see her?

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.640
Aiko, I mean.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.860
I'm looking for a lawyer for Shogun's case.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.530
So I thought I'd ask Ms. Hanamura.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.080
Of course, your cheot-sarang.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.190
She's your first love, after all.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.610
Excuse me?

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:55.060
I've always felt you two make a good pair.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.030
Me and Ms. Hanamura?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.420
Well, about that...

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.630
Not at all.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.420
But why?

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.650
Ms. Hanamura and I are merely fellow guardians of our dogs.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.120
There's nothing between us.
Please don't go stirring things up.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.050
- Aiko...
- Please wait, Ms. Hanamura.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:38.570
Regarding Shogun's case, if any problems arise later on,
could you be the...

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.530
It's impossible.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:41.650
What?

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.830
Things may get complicated later on.
I'm not the right person to ask.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.890
I'm very sorry.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:15.310
[Episode 4]

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:29.580
Perhaps I may have said something unnecessary.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.930
I'm sorry, Kai. Shall I make dinner for tonight?

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:45.140
It's fine. Just get out. Out of here, and out of my home.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.210
Of course I'll leave, eventually.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.900
And when is that?

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.690
Once I've saved enough money.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.920
So how long exactly are you gonna freeload at my place?

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.520
- Half a year.
- Say what?

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.900
No. Three months.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.080
Three days at most.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.140
Okay. One month.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.520
One week. Nothing beyond that.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.690
Don't wanna.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.540
Lunch is here. Thanks for waiting.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.070
- Thanks.
- Thank you ー

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.480
- Where's mine?
- There isn't any.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.530
- Why in tarnation?
- Stop that.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.000
- Why?
- What's up with you?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.510
Oh, right, So Ha. I heard you're looking for a part-time job?

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.810
Would you consider a job at my workplace?

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.080
"Shirataki".

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.230
Smiley face for you.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.420
Thank you.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.700
It's adorbs.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.140
Why "shirataki"?

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.290
It's my favorite Japanese word.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.820
Here is a So Ha coffee for you.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.010
Next customer, please. Right this way.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.680
Miss, please stand in line.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.940
- Thank you.
- Sorry, stand in line, please.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.300
Well done. You're hired.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.580
Really? Yes!

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.450
What's with that pose?

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.320
By working here, he can earn money and get out of my house.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.590
Don't say that. You should give him your support.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.560
You're donating these?

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.020
Yup. I'm heading over later.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.300
I hear they're in the red every month,
[Animal Shelter - Sincere Home]

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.600
and need all the manpower they can get.
[Your donations give them a life and a future]

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.720
Not to mention their facilities are deteriorating as well.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:22.120
I'll be staying to check up on the animals after my delivery.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.580
That's why I'm sorry, So Ha.
We'll hold your welcome party another day.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.110
In that case, let's do it with the three of us.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.810
"Three of us"?

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.610
Plus two dogs.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.510
Hi, Aiko.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.440
Sorry to disturb.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.110
Welcome in.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.290
The place is a little small, but please make yourself at home.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.240
As if you're the home owner.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.560
Hello, Shogun.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.340
Sorry for disturbing.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.990
Here's a little something for you two.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.140
Thank you.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.600
I'll help out once I wash up.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.430
But I'm not a great cook, so I can't say I'll be of much use...

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.170
Then can you make a seaweed dish?

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:48.840
- Seaweed?
- I asked that guy to prepare some, and he ended up with this.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.360
That's a bit much.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:56.840
I figured I'd make seaweed soup
to celebrate the birth of a couple.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.970
A couple?

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.270
Yup. Your furkids, that is.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:05.230
And I've always wanted to make these. Hand-rolled sushi.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.040
What's this? It's like a seaweed buffet.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.590
And who do you think we have to thank for that?

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.800
Before I forget, I'm sorry I wasn't able to help the other day.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.800
No, don't be. I'll wait and see what the other party will do.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:34.600
Tonight, let's discuss about how to get along with each other.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.870
- What?
- Getting along with each other?

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:40.480
Like, how frequently to meet every week,

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.270
and what to do while dating.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.920
Dating?

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.190
- What are you talking about?
- Like I said, don't stir things up.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.130
I'm talking about your dogs, Shogun and Sakura.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:03.290
Would they want to see each other every day
when they're dating?

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.240
If it were me, I'd want to.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.480
Every day?

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.530
Isn't that too much?

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:08.640
Once a month would be ideal.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.730
Isn't that too little?

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.490
- Which one then?
- Let's see.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.520
It'd be nice to meet up after work on the weekdays,

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.780
or stay over during the weekends.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.120
In which case, once on a weekday
and once on a weekend is best.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.580
- I see.
- It's painfully obvious you're not interested.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.710
Wait. Both of your sushi...

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.330
They're matchy-matchy.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.000
Of all words, you had to learn that one.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.270
You two have really good chemistry.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.060
Right, tea.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.450
♪ Tea, oh, tea; Glorious tea ♪

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.450
Why is Shogun wet?

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:54.780
You're right.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.000
Was he playing with water?

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.970
No way...

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:08.000
Kai, I've cleaned the bathroom. Thoughtful, aren't I?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
You forgot to turn off the shower.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.340
Oops, sorry.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.670
And what's this?

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:20.320
I wanted to wash the laundry,
but I didn't know how to operate the washing machine.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.530
Kai, could you do it for me?

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.400
I'll do it myself.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:37.570
That's why I said it's impossible to live with him. Totally.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.220
I shall forgive you for today.
But leave here when tomorrow comes.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.780
Tomorrow?

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.590
- I have nowhere to go.
- Like I care!

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:52.200
Japanese people. Kind. Friendly.
Returns your wallet if you drop it.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.050
Don't act like a tourist speaking in broken Japanese.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:00.500
Shogun, Sakura, don't run around.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.410
Don't you think it's fate that brought us together?

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.550
I don't think so.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.550
A bond and friendship may blossom between us.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.740
No way in hell.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:11.920
Jeez, Shogun.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.890
They made a mess.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.300
This stuff...

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.350
I don't need them.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.500
I'm back.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.800
Welcome back!

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.590
- Hi, Ms. Yuka.
- Hey.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.010
I've delivered the food and snacks.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.150
I also showered the dogs while I was there,

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.360
and helped paint the walls at the shelter.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.640
Wow, amazing!

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.120
Ms. Yuka, there's really nothing you can't do.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.350
Have you always been this capable?

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.280
Oh, I'm far from capable.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.150
I act on instinct, making a lot of blunders along the way.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:05.360
How so?

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.080
I could go on and on, really.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:12.380
For one, it took me a while to get this cafe's business to take off.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.420
I tend to lose things as well.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.800
That's true.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.610
And I wasn't able to choose the person I truly love either.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:30.240
Sumomo, have you eaten?

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.230
Have you been behaving well?

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.610
Good girl.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:41.110
Kai and Ms. Yuka are just long-time friends.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.880
Or maybe just work associates.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.520
They may even be distant relatives, for all we know.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.280
I'm not bothered by it at all. Please don't worry.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.680
I'll get going then. Thanks for having me.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.590
You sure you don't need us to send you home?

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.580
I'm going home by car. See you.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:32.500
Kai and Ms. Yuka are just long-time friends.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.030
Not at all.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.750
Ms. Hanamura and I are merely
fellow guardians of our dogs.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.980
There's nothing between us.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.820
No.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.100
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.890
Right?

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.840

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.420
- Delicious!
- Yummy!

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.380

"Fluffy finish"...

How many features are there?

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.440
"Quick wash"...

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.100
Maybe I should go with "Auto wash"...

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.970
Why on earth are you in my bed?

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:53.850
Why are you in my bed?

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:56.590
This is my room.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.410
Oh, right.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:04.870
The air conditioner in the other room didn't seem to work.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.490
Did it break down? Go check it later.

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.760
And for breakfast, something light will do.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.540
Why am I doing this?

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.240
Bon appétit!

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.430
Let's dig in.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:52.490
Delish.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:57.610
One week, tops. More specifically,
six more days, and you're out of here.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:00.640
Kai, you're really mean.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.450
You've failed as a vet.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.010
I figured Yeon Su would come to your rescue anyway.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.500
I'm not sure about that.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:17.330
Must be nice, being a rich, carefree young master
born with a silver spoon.

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.220
Do I appear that way to you?

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:29.400
You're right. I'm sure Yeon Su would come to my rescue.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.250
Good fortune comes to those who wait.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.600
Your Japanese is strangely good, it's pissing me off.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.840
Your phone's not a smartphone?

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.760
What's up?

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.320
She didn't come to pick up her dog?

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.210
No. The bronchitis has been treated and brought under control,

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.570
so her owner was supposed to pick her up last night.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:54.730
What's the name of the owner? That rich-looking madam, that is.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.300
Ms. Yuzuki Hayasaka.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.670
She lives alone.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.180
I tried contacting her, but was directed to voicemail.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.530
Don't tell me... she abandoned her dog?

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.320
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.540
Mr. Yeon Su, how are things over there?

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.600
They are currently discussing legal arrangements
regarding the dog.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.000
What's the situation concerning So Ha?

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.340
Since my young master is currently in your care,
I suppose you ought to know.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.370
But I ask that you please keep this to yourself.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:41.050
Right now, his siblings, So Jin and So Yeong,

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:44.710
are vying to be the future president of WooRoA.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:48.500
Though they say that So Ha is the most talented,

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:53.530
ultimately, being part of a conglomerate family
puts him in a tricky position.

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.750
For example, even if he was able to
join his high school's elite class,

00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:01.730
others would gossip that he got in
through family influence, and not through ability.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:06.060
And there would be many others who befriended him
in the hopes of benefiting from his connections.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.630
He may not appear bothered,
but I'm sure he has plenty of bad memories about it.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.990
You're feeling lonely now that you're alone, aren't you?

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.710
It'll be all right.

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:23.550
Don't worry.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.380
I'll try calling her again.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.250
Lend me your phone.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.570
What? Wait...

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:48.530
He's feeling lost and wondering who he truly is.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:53.390
He must have been worn out from dealing with all this.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:03.330
So you're saying that Mocha may have been abandoned?
[Lovely Tails Cafe]

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.970
That's what we fear, from the look of things.

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.320
It's a crime to abandon one's own pet.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.600
It's a violation of the Animal Welfare Act.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.940
People have their reasons, valid or not.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.820

- Yup.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.620
I'm donating all proceeds to charity.

Please wear this too, So Ha.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.530

Thank you for waiting.

You look good in that, So Ha.

- Thanks for the compliment.
- Does he, really?

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.780

Kai, have you come for a date?

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.330
- What?
- A date?

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.690
Oh, you mean Shogun and Sakura.

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.220
They both look lovey-dovey as always.

This is for Sakura.

- Thank you.
- Hey there, Shogun.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.940
There's a park where you can watch the fireworks from.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.660
How about you two give it a visit?
Pets are also welcome there.

Just so you know, I'm not bothered by it.

Glad? About what?

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:42.590
I mean, you come off as eccentric to me.

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:47.000
You have this unique quirkiness
that's running on a different tempo from others.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.320
That's rude, no matter how polite you make it sound.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:55.080
Anyway, I'm glad that you have good memories.

I used to come here with my friends.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:35.680
I thought we'd be together for the rest of our lives.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.020
But that didn't happen.

Why did you share it with me?

I don't know.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:24.490
Maybe because it's you.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.830
I guess I just wanted to get it off my chest.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.170

No, we didn't.

Why? You're planning to use it
to film a beauty salon ad or something?

Of course. I could use the money.

Let me give you one last piece of advice.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:05.170
If you continue like this, you'll stand to lose everything you have.

But it doesn't matter anyway, right?

So please reciprocate that love with yours.

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.960
I'm sorry, Mocha.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:48.780
Good that you won't be alone.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.660
Is this all thanks to me?

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.000
You're sorely mistaken.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.830
Nah, I saved the day.

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:16.130
Don't be so full of yourself.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.480
That was scary.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:28.140
But on account of that,
you get to stay at my place for a few more days.

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.180
For real?

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.330
Oh yeah!

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:37.010
- Make an omelet for me again.
- What?

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:45.320
And fix the air conditioner in my room,
and do my laundry, if you can.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.170
Don't get too full of yourself.

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:52.300
Hey, Kai.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.060
Shogun, catch up with him!

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.020
Go for it, Shogun!

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.240
Why in tarnation, Kai?

[Shirosaki Animal Hospital]

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.440
Mr. Shirosaki.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.300
You have a visitor.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.710
He said he wishes to speak to you regarding animal shelters.

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:23.680
What is it?

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.400
Thanks for waiting. Your lunch for today.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.040
Sandwiches.

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:52.780
Kai, it's been a while.

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:58.820
Who is he?

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:23.350
[Epilogue]

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:25.140
It's getting more crowded.

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:29.320
Shall we take a shortcut?

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.120
- Huh?
- Over there.

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:33.820
Whoa, sorry!

00:45:57.850 --> 00:45:59.530
Sorry about that!

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:06.290
Thank you.

No problem.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.570
If both of them love you, who would you choose?

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:22.020
Wait, Kai.

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:24.850
Pass your worries to me, your chingu.

00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:27.600
You came to my mind, Mr. Shirosaki.
