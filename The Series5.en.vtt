00:00:00.094 --> 00:00:10.170


00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:13.947
Tony, please.

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:15.724
Please, I'll do anything that you want.

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.600
Please, I just, I need you to help me.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.326
I'm begging you.

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.285
Please.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.203
Please.

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:22.272
Hon, you’re here.

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.581
Where are you going?

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:24.482
I was calling you.

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:25.900
Is your phone off?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.360
I need 16 or more clients.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.362
Can you find them?

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:30.989
Well, if I’m going to
give you more clients,

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.304
how are you going to give
them the answers?

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.832
We’ll all take the exams
in different classrooms.

00:00:35.086 --> 00:00:37.213
I’ll give them the answers
by taking advantage of

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:38.956
our defective speakers.

00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:40.541
Just remember.

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:42.376
If it’s the bounce sound,

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:44.420
that’s the starting signal.

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:46.213
The next ones,

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:48.007
those are the answers.

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:48.882
Mr. Bangkat.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:49.928
Ms. Briones.

00:00:50.647 --> 00:00:52.263
please, even just listen to it again.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.406
Here's my flash drive.

00:02:35.406 --> 00:02:36.550
Here’s your flash drive.

00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:38.410
- You might forget it.
- Thank you.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.629
Bangkat, did you see who did this?

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.466
There’s no one here.

00:03:51.254 --> 00:03:52.332
Let’s go.

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.238
Come on, let’s go to
the principal’s office.

00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:15.897
Fuck!

00:05:15.922 --> 00:05:17.025
How did this happen?

00:05:17.842 --> 00:05:19.094
Calm down, Hon.

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:20.642
Grace, 'calm down?'

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:22.047
This is serious!

00:05:22.187 --> 00:05:23.313
Bank already knows,

00:05:23.338 --> 00:05:25.799
and he went to the storage
room and even brought a teacher.

00:05:26.677 --> 00:05:28.095
This is exactly what
I was telling you, Lin.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.788
We’re gonna have problems with Bank.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:30.789
But what did you do?

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.205
You just let him.

00:05:32.755 --> 00:05:33.807
What now?

00:05:35.408 --> 00:05:38.453
Lin, are you sure that it was even Bank?

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:40.627
I mean, you were hiding, right?

00:05:42.923 --> 00:05:44.383
If he did see me,

00:05:45.146 --> 00:05:46.189
he didn’t do anything.

00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:49.814
He didn’t open the locker door.

00:05:49.892 --> 00:05:51.935
And he didn’t tell Ms. Briones.

00:05:53.127 --> 00:05:54.127
Then that’s good!

00:05:54.503 --> 00:05:55.938
You didn’t get caught.

00:05:55.963 --> 00:05:58.674
So he doesn't have a proof and
he doesn't have a case.

00:06:01.093 --> 00:06:02.511
I’ll talk to him.

00:06:05.056 --> 00:06:06.056
Fine.

00:06:06.557 --> 00:06:07.850
But if he doesn’t listen,

00:06:08.142 --> 00:06:09.560
I’ll handle him myself.

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:12.479
You know what,

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:14.398
let’s just stop this.

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:15.983
- What?
- Huh?

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:19.028
What do you mean we’re stopping?

00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:21.697
This is as far as I go.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.300
From now on,

00:06:24.325 --> 00:06:25.910
I’m not giving you the answers anymore.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.053
- The hell?!
- Huh?

00:06:27.078 --> 00:06:28.704
Do you even hear yourself, Lin?

00:06:30.915 --> 00:06:32.500
My decision is final.

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:35.544
I warned you before, this time would come.

00:06:37.088 --> 00:06:40.174
So you want us to retake the
test that we didn’t study for?

00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:41.759
We won’t be able to answer anything.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.152
You know that, Lin.

00:06:43.177 --> 00:06:45.846
It’s just one test.

00:06:46.138 --> 00:06:47.223
Your grades are already high.

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:48.474
I’ve done my part.

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:49.725
That’s not the point.

00:06:49.725 --> 00:06:51.852
You promised us that
you were gonna help us.

00:06:53.104 --> 00:06:54.104
Look.

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:57.483
Sorry, Pat, but I can’t do this anymore.

00:07:04.198 --> 00:07:05.198
Sis.

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:07.119
Look.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.853
I know that you're scared,

00:07:10.102 --> 00:07:11.186
but so are we.

00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:13.881
But there's still something
that we can do about this, right?

00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:16.241
It’s not over yet.

00:07:18.087 --> 00:07:20.422
It’s too dangerous, Grace.

00:07:20.923 --> 00:07:22.733
What we’re doing is already too wrong.

00:07:22.758 --> 00:07:25.636
If we keep this up, nobody wins.

00:07:25.823 --> 00:07:28.034
But we’ve already started this, Lin.

00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:30.018
We can still fix it.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.600
Wow.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.728
How convenient for you.

00:07:35.437 --> 00:07:37.481
Now that there’s trouble,
that’s when you quit?

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:39.817
After everything we’ve been through?

00:07:42.653 --> 00:07:44.071
I’ll return the money.

00:07:45.114 --> 00:07:47.199
Just tell our other clients, I’m done.

00:07:50.494 --> 00:07:51.954
How much do you want?

00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:53.314
I’ll double it.

00:08:13.475 --> 00:08:14.475
Tristan.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.020
Are you with me?

00:08:21.025 --> 00:08:22.985
Ms. Briones tells me there was cheating

00:08:22.985 --> 00:08:24.904
that happened through
the broken sound system.

00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:28.340
Do you have any idea

00:08:28.365 --> 00:08:29.950
who’s behind this?

00:08:38.834 --> 00:08:40.461
How do you even know

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.714
that cheating happened in the first place?

00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:48.844
I heard the students talking
about it in the restroom.

00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:54.516
Okay.

00:09:05.689 --> 00:09:09.109
Peterson, explain to me how this
happened under your watch, please.

00:09:10.366 --> 00:09:12.243
Ma’am, I swear I don’t know anything.

00:09:12.534 --> 00:09:15.246
The sound system had already
been broken for days at that time.

00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:17.748
They said the repairs
would still take a while.

00:09:18.249 --> 00:09:19.833
I don’t like being lied to.

00:09:21.877 --> 00:09:22.920
Until someone admits it,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.924
your participation in the Interschool
Journalism Conference is on hold.

00:09:26.924 --> 00:09:28.003
Understood?

00:09:28.425 --> 00:09:29.636
You may now leave.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.182
Unbelievable, these students, my god.

00:09:38.782 --> 00:09:40.868
Ma’am, excuse me.

00:09:41.939 --> 00:09:44.441
I already fixed our sound system.

00:09:44.733 --> 00:09:45.745
Thank you.

00:09:46.569 --> 00:09:48.904
How long was the sound system broken?

00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:50.114
Was it about a week?

00:09:50.114 --> 00:09:51.126
Oh no, not really, ma’am.

00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:52.611
Only about two days.

00:09:53.117 --> 00:09:55.035
Ma’am, is there anything
else you want me to do?

00:09:55.035 --> 00:09:56.203
None. Thank you.

00:09:56.203 --> 00:09:57.722
I’ll go ahead now. Thank you.

00:10:10.426 --> 00:10:11.426
Yes.

00:10:12.594 --> 00:10:15.222
I need the results of the final exams ASAP.

00:10:15.222 --> 00:10:16.222
Please send them to me.

00:10:17.266 --> 00:10:18.266
Thank you.

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:22.687
Bank.

00:10:23.355 --> 00:10:24.773
Bank, I’ve been looking for you.

00:10:25.316 --> 00:10:26.942
Bank, please talk to me.

00:10:26.942 --> 00:10:28.193
- Bank!
- What is it?

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:30.946
Let me explain.

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:33.031
Don’t worry.

00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:35.326
I didn’t sell you out.

00:10:36.744 --> 00:10:38.495
I lied, just like you did.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.630
You know what?

00:10:51.675 --> 00:10:53.302
I actually forgot the feeling,

00:10:54.178 --> 00:10:56.430
and it really is awful when I lie.

00:10:57.222 --> 00:10:58.265
It’s sickening.

00:10:59.484 --> 00:11:00.610
Don’t you feel guilty?

00:11:18.535 --> 00:11:20.496
Please listen to me, Bank, please.

00:11:21.176 --> 00:11:23.136
I’m not proud that I did it.

00:11:23.288 --> 00:11:24.872
But you need to know why.

00:11:25.959 --> 00:11:28.212
I don’t care about your excuses.

00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:33.717
The school was the first to cheat us.

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:40.140
Papa borrows money
just so I can study here.

00:11:42.017 --> 00:11:43.227
That’s not true.

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:45.521
You’re a scholar like me,

00:11:45.854 --> 00:11:47.398
we don’t pay tuition fees.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:49.608
I thought so too before.

00:11:51.235 --> 00:11:53.821
I thought grades were
enough, but they’re not.

00:11:54.738 --> 00:11:56.740
What we give them isn’t enough.

00:11:58.325 --> 00:11:59.325
What are you talking about?

00:11:59.993 --> 00:12:00.993
Lin,

00:12:02.037 --> 00:12:04.998
my mom and I are here in
Manila because of this scholarship.

00:12:05.796 --> 00:12:07.685
What part of that don’t you get?

00:12:07.709 --> 00:12:10.629
Don’t you understand how
big of a deal that is for us?

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:13.382
Do you think we’re the only
ones who want to study here?

00:12:14.341 --> 00:12:15.884
We’re the only smart ones?

00:12:17.511 --> 00:12:19.054
Possenti accepted us.

00:12:20.305 --> 00:12:22.224
Whatever their standards are, that’s it.

00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:24.476
And they can’t accept everyone.

00:12:25.352 --> 00:12:27.020
The system is cheating us.

00:12:28.188 --> 00:12:30.149
Because if Possenti accepts bribes,

00:12:30.357 --> 00:12:33.360
our miscellaneous fees can
reach one hundred thousand pesos,

00:12:33.735 --> 00:12:35.320
even though we’re scholars.

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:38.073
I need money.

00:12:39.241 --> 00:12:41.785
And Papa deserves some comfort.

00:12:42.703 --> 00:12:45.706
It’s not fair to him or to your mom.

00:12:47.332 --> 00:12:49.001
They’re taking advantage…

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:51.044
of us, Bank.

00:12:51.044 --> 00:12:53.130
They’re taking advantage of us!

00:12:58.886 --> 00:13:00.596
Even if what you’re saying is true,

00:13:01.805 --> 00:13:03.599
I’ll still fight fair.

00:13:05.017 --> 00:13:06.143
I’m not like you.

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:10.856
I’m not your enemy.

00:13:35.964 --> 00:13:37.549
Thanks for the ride, hon.

00:13:40.219 --> 00:13:41.487
Hon,

00:13:41.512 --> 00:13:42.554
you good?

00:13:46.767 --> 00:13:48.894
It’s just Lin, hon.

00:13:49.353 --> 00:13:51.396
I still feel really down.

00:13:52.689 --> 00:13:53.689
Come here.

00:13:56.193 --> 00:13:58.195
Aren’t you sad for us too?

00:14:01.323 --> 00:14:02.616
What do you mean?

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:05.994
That our scores will drop.

00:14:06.578 --> 00:14:07.578
Come on!

00:14:08.372 --> 00:14:09.456
That's just rude!

00:14:09.665 --> 00:14:11.625
You’re not even worried about her?

00:14:13.043 --> 00:14:15.712
Of course, I was joking.

00:14:16.338 --> 00:14:17.631
I’m worried for her too.

00:14:18.215 --> 00:14:20.842
I know, we promised her
she’s not gonna get caught.

00:14:21.802 --> 00:14:23.512
But well, that’s just how it is.

00:14:24.304 --> 00:14:25.806
There’s nothing we can do about it.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.100
But, hon.

00:14:29.601 --> 00:14:30.601
Shh.

00:14:31.812 --> 00:14:34.398
You know your phone? It’s so old now.

00:14:35.399 --> 00:14:36.775
You need to replace it.

00:14:37.359 --> 00:14:38.359
This.

00:14:40.562 --> 00:14:41.571
Right.

00:14:41.822 --> 00:14:44.366
You know, my screen is cracked but

00:14:45.158 --> 00:14:47.119
dad still says it works so...

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:49.954
Well,

00:14:51.623 --> 00:14:53.292
good thing I’m here.

00:14:56.712 --> 00:14:59.298
Hon, what’s this?

00:15:00.424 --> 00:15:03.176
Consider it a late anniversary gift.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.309
Patrick Joseph Tioseco!

00:15:10.767 --> 00:15:12.394
I can’t accept this!

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.607
It’s already fully paid
and no late returns.

00:15:16.898 --> 00:15:18.150
So, it’s really yours now.

00:15:21.862 --> 00:15:22.988
I love you!

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:24.948
Oh, thank you!

00:15:24.948 --> 00:15:26.158
Thank you so much!

00:15:26.158 --> 00:15:27.576
Anything for you, hon.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.769
Linlin, you have a visitor!

00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:56.705
Grace?

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.441
- Hi!
- What are you doing here?

00:15:59.816 --> 00:16:02.194
Wait, did you fight with your dad?

00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:03.089
Huh?

00:16:03.236 --> 00:16:04.279
No, of course not.

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:06.740
No, I just wanted to cheer you up.

00:16:07.182 --> 00:16:10.827
And don’t think that I’m here to try to
change your mind about the cheating, okay?

00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:16.166
I totally respect your decision.

00:16:17.206 --> 00:16:19.292
Thanks for understanding, sis.

00:16:22.714 --> 00:16:24.299
Oh my, thank you.

00:16:24.299 --> 00:16:25.842
My favorite!

00:16:47.364 --> 00:16:48.364
Who’s that?

00:16:49.116 --> 00:16:50.867
Maybe they’re looking for you at home.

00:16:51.576 --> 00:16:53.078
Ah, no, it’s nothing.

00:16:54.413 --> 00:16:55.413
So...

00:16:55.872 --> 00:16:57.833
how are you and Bank?

00:17:01.503 --> 00:17:03.046
He's so angry at me.

00:17:03.296 --> 00:17:04.296
He said

00:17:04.756 --> 00:17:06.007
I’m a liar,

00:17:06.508 --> 00:17:07.551
a cheater,

00:17:08.802 --> 00:17:10.262
heartless,

00:17:12.389 --> 00:17:13.849
a bad person.

00:17:14.182 --> 00:17:15.182
Huh?

00:17:15.851 --> 00:17:17.060
Sis, you know,

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.104
that is just way too harsh.

00:17:19.813 --> 00:17:21.022
But it’s true.

00:17:23.525 --> 00:17:25.402
I deserve to hear all of that.

00:17:27.487 --> 00:17:28.655
Bank hates me.

00:17:31.116 --> 00:17:32.909
Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?

00:17:37.664 --> 00:17:40.250
Maybe he just needs more time,

00:17:40.625 --> 00:17:41.625
you know?

00:17:41.877 --> 00:17:42.689
But,

00:17:42.714 --> 00:17:45.425
this could be a sign for you too, sis.

00:17:45.839 --> 00:17:47.382
You could focus more on your coll--

00:17:47.924 --> 00:17:48.925
not college, sorry.

00:17:48.925 --> 00:17:50.719
Your scholarship applications.

00:17:51.636 --> 00:17:54.514
But there’s still so
much I want to tell him.

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:56.391
So much I’ve been keeping.

00:17:57.225 --> 00:17:59.102
Even Dad doesn’t know.

00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:08.403
Yeah, I can totally relate.

00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:10.363
All the secrets.

00:18:13.685 --> 00:18:14.685
Secrets?

00:18:19.581 --> 00:18:21.917
I mean, with me and Pat.

00:18:23.293 --> 00:18:26.379
My dad can’t find out about
us because he’ll get mad.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.676
Well, I’m happy you and Pat are solid.

00:18:36.598 --> 00:18:37.724
Thanks for the snack, okay?

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:40.685
Didn’t you just get a new phone?

00:18:52.322 --> 00:18:54.115
Sorry, it’s my dad.

00:18:54.115 --> 00:18:56.117
I should be heading home now.

00:18:56.785 --> 00:18:58.119
Hey, thank you.

00:18:59.663 --> 00:19:00.831
Thanks for surprising me.

00:19:01.122 --> 00:19:03.083
Yeah, I hope you’re feeling better.

00:19:04.251 --> 00:19:05.919
I really appreciate it, sis.

00:19:05.919 --> 00:19:06.728
Of course.

00:19:06.753 --> 00:19:08.505
Okay, bye.

00:19:08.964 --> 00:19:09.940
Bye!

00:19:09.965 --> 00:19:11.268
Take care, okay!

00:19:11.341 --> 00:19:13.343
Hey, if you need anything
just call me, okay?

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:14.177
Okay.

00:19:14.177 --> 00:19:17.639
You can still sleepover if you want.

00:19:19.474 --> 00:19:20.559
Take care, sis.

00:19:21.296 --> 00:19:22.314
- Thank you.
- Bye!

00:19:43.665 --> 00:19:44.665
Lin?

00:19:47.002 --> 00:19:48.002
Pat?

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.338
What are you doing here?

00:19:51.214 --> 00:19:52.924
Lin, can you come with me?

00:19:52.924 --> 00:19:53.550
Wait a minute.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:54.968
How did you even know my address?

00:19:56.803 --> 00:19:58.430
Lin, can you come with me?

00:19:58.972 --> 00:19:59.972
What?

00:20:00.849 --> 00:20:03.560
No, where are you taking me?

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.728
It’s about Grace.

00:20:04.728 --> 00:20:05.971
Where is she going?

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:09.941
She’s going back to her house.

00:20:11.985 --> 00:20:12.527
Wait, hold on.

00:20:12.527 --> 00:20:13.737
What’s going on, Pat?

00:20:14.946 --> 00:20:16.323
Do you notice her new phone?

00:20:16.865 --> 00:20:18.033
I gave that to her.

00:20:19.576 --> 00:20:21.088
It has a tracking device.

00:20:21.494 --> 00:20:22.494
What?

00:20:23.163 --> 00:20:24.331
A tracking device?

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:28.168
Why are you doing that to her?

00:20:28.877 --> 00:20:31.671
That is such a breach of trust.

00:20:34.215 --> 00:20:34.799
And you?

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:37.221
You seriously believe
she’s really going home now?

00:20:37.594 --> 00:20:38.678
Alright, so where is she right now?

00:20:38.678 --> 00:20:40.472
Why is she so far from her house?

00:20:45.408 --> 00:20:46.408
Okay.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.104
I know I haven’t been a
perfect boyfriend to her.

00:20:52.379 --> 00:20:54.673
And I’ve been messing
around with side chicks.

00:20:56.613 --> 00:20:58.031
You’re cheating on her.

00:20:58.031 --> 00:21:01.201
But I’ve got the right to
know if she’s safe, Lin.

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:04.018
Lin, do you know anything?

00:21:05.914 --> 00:21:07.700
Look, we’re not hiding anything from you

00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:09.435
if that’s what you’re thinking, Pat.

00:21:11.211 --> 00:21:13.880
Look, I didn’t even expect
her to visit the house.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.715
See, that’s what I’m talking about.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.135
She’s been acting strange.

00:21:20.261 --> 00:21:21.972
Even if she doesn’t tell me, I know it.

00:21:21.972 --> 00:21:23.041
I can feel it.

00:21:23.765 --> 00:21:26.518
So, Lin, please, come with me.

00:21:26.893 --> 00:21:28.812
Let’s follow Grace now, please.

00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:31.873
Let’s go.

00:21:31.898 --> 00:21:33.775
Fine, alright, Pat!

00:21:52.961 --> 00:21:53.961
Ah, Hon.

00:22:09.185 --> 00:22:11.104
Okay, let’s be rational.

00:22:11.354 --> 00:22:13.565
Maybe this is a relative’s
house or a family friend’s.

00:22:13.857 --> 00:22:15.025
Why is she alone, then?

00:22:15.942 --> 00:22:17.193
What time is it, Lin?

00:22:23.033 --> 00:22:24.075
Hon, come here.

00:22:28.288 --> 00:22:29.330
Let’s go.

00:22:48.759 --> 00:22:49.759
Wow.

00:22:50.827 --> 00:22:51.953
This is too much.

00:22:51.978 --> 00:22:53.688
You really shouldn’t have.

00:22:59.861 --> 00:23:02.119
Is this the first time you’ve
seen something like this?

00:23:10.205 --> 00:23:11.623
Pat is just wasting you.

00:23:20.548 --> 00:23:22.759
Lin, can you please call her?

00:23:29.891 --> 00:23:31.392
It’s just the two of us here.

00:23:35.146 --> 00:23:36.981
Sorry, I have to check this.

00:23:47.742 --> 00:23:48.910
It’s Lin.

00:23:50.161 --> 00:23:51.204
I really need to take this.

00:23:51.204 --> 00:23:52.619
She’s already worried.

00:23:53.373 --> 00:23:54.463
Is she in love with you?

00:23:56.042 --> 00:23:57.119
She’s clingy, huh.

00:23:59.087 --> 00:24:00.338
Okay, fine, go ahead.

00:24:00.547 --> 00:24:02.173
Answer it so you’ll be at peace.

00:24:07.137 --> 00:24:08.113
Grace?

00:24:08.146 --> 00:24:09.377
Are you home already?

00:24:12.433 --> 00:24:13.433
Lin!

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.310
Hi, yeah.

00:24:15.645 --> 00:24:17.522
Sorry, I forgot to text you.

00:24:19.399 --> 00:24:20.775
But yeah, I’m home.

00:24:23.862 --> 00:24:25.655
Ah, is that so?

00:24:26.531 --> 00:24:27.531
That’s good.

00:24:32.996 --> 00:24:34.664
Do you need anything else?

00:24:38.209 --> 00:24:40.503
Thanks for keeping me company earlier.

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:42.589
Come back next time, okay?

00:24:42.589 --> 00:24:46.259
Dad said, if you want,
we can have a sleepover?

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.185
Sure, I would really like that.

00:24:55.185 --> 00:24:56.811
Yeah, just let me know when.

00:25:05.528 --> 00:25:07.614
Uh, Lin, I’ll hang up now, okay?

00:25:07.614 --> 00:25:09.032
I really have to shower.

00:25:10.241 --> 00:25:12.035
Okay, um, take care, Grace, alright?

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.786
If there’s anything you nee—

00:25:14.996 --> 00:25:16.065
Dumb bitch!

00:25:17.498 --> 00:25:18.510
Fucking liar!

00:25:18.917 --> 00:25:20.543
Okay, just calm down.

00:25:21.085 --> 00:25:22.086
She’ll come out eventually.

00:25:22.086 --> 00:25:24.047
Then we’ll just talk properly, okay?

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:49.989
After everything I’ve done for her,

00:25:49.989 --> 00:25:51.658
she’s the first girl I’ve
ever taken seriously,

00:25:51.658 --> 00:25:53.159
and she’s gonna do this to me?

00:25:53.826 --> 00:25:55.328
It’s okay, Pat.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.747
Remember, she’ll come out eventually.

00:25:58.915 --> 00:26:00.708
We'll talk to her when she comes out.

00:26:23.293 --> 00:26:24.293
Um...

00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:25.500
Should...

00:26:25.525 --> 00:26:27.068
Should we be drinking this?

00:26:27.068 --> 00:26:29.028
I don’t really drink alcohol.

00:26:29.028 --> 00:26:30.238
Relax, relax.

00:26:30.905 --> 00:26:31.932
Just try it.

00:26:42.417 --> 00:26:43.001
Um...

00:26:43.001 --> 00:26:44.335
- Sorry, I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

00:26:44.335 --> 00:26:46.087
Shit, sorry, I’m so sorry.

00:26:46.087 --> 00:26:46.838
I’m so sorry.

00:26:46.879 --> 00:26:47.885
I’m sorry.

00:26:48.464 --> 00:26:49.464
Grace!

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.676
Don’t make a fool out of me.

00:26:54.554 --> 00:26:56.097
I know what you’re doing.

00:26:58.141 --> 00:26:59.642
You’re just stalling.

00:27:17.493 --> 00:27:19.037
You really don’t like me?

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
What?

00:27:27.545 --> 00:27:29.088
Do I disgust you?

00:27:46.856 --> 00:27:48.191
You’re not into me?

00:27:53.112 --> 00:27:54.112
Come on.

00:27:55.365 --> 00:27:56.741
I’m a nice guy.

00:28:14.884 --> 00:28:16.427
I’m still a virgin, Tony.

00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:21.224
I thought you already knew that.

00:28:21.224 --> 00:28:22.350
I never even did it,

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:23.601
not even with Pat.

00:28:24.477 --> 00:28:25.477
Not yet.

00:28:26.813 --> 00:28:28.773
But you still have a plan after all.

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:31.250
Grace,

00:28:31.275 --> 00:28:32.735
I’m a virgin too.

00:28:33.903 --> 00:28:35.780
Let’s give this to each other.

00:28:37.907 --> 00:28:38.907
Pat?

00:28:41.327 --> 00:28:42.428
Damn it.

00:28:42.453 --> 00:28:43.746
He doesn’t deserve you.

00:28:44.372 --> 00:28:46.516
I know him better than you do, okay?

00:28:46.541 --> 00:28:48.376
So who’s the girl he’s flirting with?

00:28:49.001 --> 00:28:50.962
Who’s your boyfriend flirting with?

00:28:50.962 --> 00:28:53.214
You can’t use that against us because...

00:28:53.965 --> 00:28:55.299
because I already know.

00:28:56.551 --> 00:28:57.551
Wow.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.720
You knew?

00:29:02.098 --> 00:29:03.641
He’s cheating on you and you know it

00:29:03.641 --> 00:29:04.976
and that’s okay with you?

00:29:06.394 --> 00:29:08.062
What Pat and I have,

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:12.233
you will never understand.

00:29:19.657 --> 00:29:20.657
Grace,

00:29:21.951 --> 00:29:23.703
I’m here for you.

00:29:24.745 --> 00:29:26.330
Give me a chance, please.

00:29:34.956 --> 00:29:35.956
Okay?

00:29:37.341 --> 00:29:38.341
You're gonna hurt me?

00:29:39.177 --> 00:29:40.303
Then hurt me.

00:29:40.845 --> 00:29:42.221
Wow.

00:29:44.223 --> 00:29:45.223
Hurt me.

00:29:47.477 --> 00:29:48.477
Go ahead.

00:30:10.462 --> 00:30:11.462
What!

00:30:11.501 --> 00:30:12.501
What?

00:30:14.182 --> 00:30:15.313
You don’t want me?

00:30:15.338 --> 00:30:16.255
You don’t want me?!

00:30:16.255 --> 00:30:17.064
Huh?

00:30:17.089 --> 00:30:18.089
Fuck it!

00:30:19.133 --> 00:30:20.133
Pat.

00:30:20.642 --> 00:30:22.136
Pat, wait. Pat!

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:25.156
Pat.

00:30:25.181 --> 00:30:26.400
You don’t want me?

00:30:26.599 --> 00:30:27.642
So you really don’t want me!

00:30:27.892 --> 00:30:28.908
No!

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:31.521
Put that down!

00:30:31.521 --> 00:30:32.246
Please.

00:30:32.271 --> 00:30:32.997
Please.

00:30:33.022 --> 00:30:33.748
What?

00:30:33.773 --> 00:30:34.869
Huh?

00:30:42.532 --> 00:30:43.596
Grace.

00:30:48.955 --> 00:30:50.164
Pat. Stop it!

00:30:54.252 --> 00:30:55.346
Please.

00:30:55.753 --> 00:30:56.807
Hon, stop?

00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:00.383
He was about to fucking rape you, Grace!

00:31:01.551 --> 00:31:03.361
What the fuck are you talking about?

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:07.682
What are you doing here, Grace?

00:31:08.558 --> 00:31:10.184
I’m so sorry.

00:31:10.184 --> 00:31:10.977
And please,

00:31:10.977 --> 00:31:12.853
it’s not what it looks like.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.566
Please, you have to believe me.

00:31:28.953 --> 00:31:31.539
You told me that you love
me, but you were fooling me.

00:31:33.708 --> 00:31:34.708
Amy,

00:31:35.918 --> 00:31:36.919
Francine,

00:31:38.504 --> 00:31:39.964
Cheska.

00:31:46.929 --> 00:31:47.822
Pat,

00:31:47.847 --> 00:31:48.978
hon.

00:31:49.849 --> 00:31:51.892
I know I messed up.

00:31:52.685 --> 00:31:54.145
That’s true.

00:31:55.646 --> 00:31:57.732
But you did too.

00:31:59.358 --> 00:32:01.360
You cheated on me first.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.416
That’s not true.

00:32:03.863 --> 00:32:05.448
And I have proof.

00:32:06.073 --> 00:32:07.325
So please,

00:32:09.619 --> 00:32:11.704
please don’t lie to me.

00:32:12.038 --> 00:32:13.119
Please.

00:32:13.456 --> 00:32:14.471
Yes.

00:32:14.707 --> 00:32:16.083
Yes, it hurts.

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:17.447
It hurts.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.046
But I’ve accepted it.

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:26.010
I tried to understand
you because I love you.

00:32:27.303 --> 00:32:28.971
I love you.

00:32:30.973 --> 00:32:32.058
So I hope...

00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:37.647
I hope you can understand me too, please.

00:32:39.273 --> 00:32:42.860
I didn’t want it to be like this.

00:32:44.028 --> 00:32:45.279
Please.

00:32:48.032 --> 00:32:49.241
You’re so messed up.

00:32:52.244 --> 00:32:53.913
You cheated because I cheated?

00:32:56.916 --> 00:32:59.043
Out of all people, it’s Tony?

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:06.174
You’re blackmailing her, aren’t you?

00:33:07.802 --> 00:33:09.945
Grace was the one who came to me first.

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:12.473
- Shut the f*ck up!
- Pat, stop it!

00:33:12.765 --> 00:33:14.016
Stop it!

00:33:14.767 --> 00:33:16.394
Grace, tell the truth!

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.020
What?

00:33:19.855 --> 00:33:22.149
Say something, Grace! Say something!

00:33:22.322 --> 00:33:23.359
Tony, stop it!

00:33:23.359 --> 00:33:24.486
You too, Lin!

00:33:26.237 --> 00:33:28.408
You're meddling when
you don’t even know anything!

00:33:35.059 --> 00:33:36.894
Unbelievable!

00:33:39.208 --> 00:33:41.210
You lied to your boyfriend already.

00:33:43.003 --> 00:33:44.672
And now to your best friend too?

00:33:46.132 --> 00:33:47.275
What?

00:33:47.383 --> 00:33:49.051
What, Grace? Tell the truth!

00:33:49.552 --> 00:33:50.803
No, speak up!

00:33:51.011 --> 00:33:52.113
You don’t want to talk?

00:33:52.138 --> 00:33:54.098
You don’t want to talk? Or should I?

00:33:54.557 --> 00:33:55.557
Oh, Lin,

00:33:55.599 --> 00:33:56.475
aren’t you wondering

00:33:56.475 --> 00:34:00.088
why I suddenly took back saying that I was
the one who leaked the answers to our exam?

00:34:02.064 --> 00:34:03.994
You already interrogated me, right?

00:34:06.402 --> 00:34:10.489
Grace was the one who leaked
it, that’s why it reached Kyle.

00:34:13.868 --> 00:34:15.286
She had an agreement with Claire

00:34:15.286 --> 00:34:17.997
that if Grace gave the exam answers,

00:34:17.997 --> 00:34:19.540
Claire wouldn’t audition.

00:34:20.124 --> 00:34:22.293
Huh? So the lead role would go to Grace—

00:34:22.293 --> 00:34:23.335
Stop!

00:34:23.335 --> 00:34:24.462
And then this Claire!

00:34:24.462 --> 00:34:27.648
She shared the exam answers
with the rest of the drama club!

00:34:27.673 --> 00:34:28.716
Including Kyle!

00:34:29.633 --> 00:34:32.470
No! No! No!

00:34:37.641 --> 00:34:41.479
No, no, just don’t believe it! Please!

00:34:42.062 --> 00:34:43.689
Claire set me up!

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.650
She set me up!

00:34:47.276 --> 00:34:49.904
I just wanted the lead part!

00:34:49.904 --> 00:34:52.281
I was just desperate, okay?

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:54.867
That’s it!

00:34:54.867 --> 00:34:57.244
He promised me he would
help me! You promised!

00:34:57.244 --> 00:35:00.389
No! I didn’t forced
this! I didn’t forced you!

00:35:00.414 --> 00:35:03.000
You chose me because you knew I’d say yes!

00:35:04.376 --> 00:35:05.376
Right?

00:35:06.879 --> 00:35:08.798
All of this had a price, didn’t it?

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:13.219
- You offered yourself to me, Grace!
- No!

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:18.516
Please, please, please, Lin.

00:35:20.434 --> 00:35:21.434
Please.

00:35:22.937 --> 00:35:24.163
Hon!

00:35:24.188 --> 00:35:27.691
Please, please. I’m so sorry.

00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:32.738
Hon, I love you. You understand, right?

00:35:32.738 --> 00:35:35.658
I didn’t want it to be like this.

00:35:36.912 --> 00:35:38.330
I love you.

00:35:38.355 --> 00:35:39.355
Bullshit!

00:35:41.664 --> 00:35:43.292
I don’t know you anymore, Grace.

00:35:47.711 --> 00:35:48.711
I’m done.

00:35:49.125 --> 00:35:50.129
No!

00:35:52.383 --> 00:35:53.384
We’re done!

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.136
No. No!

00:35:56.136 --> 00:35:58.055
Hon, please!

00:35:58.264 --> 00:36:00.891
Let’s talk, please!

00:36:03.451 --> 00:36:06.663
No, please, please. Lin!

00:36:07.481 --> 00:36:09.525
No, please, please, please. Sis!

00:36:09.733 --> 00:36:11.735
Lin! No!

00:36:11.735 --> 00:36:12.862
Lin!

00:36:14.196 --> 00:36:17.908
Please! Please! Please!

00:36:18.117 --> 00:36:21.328
Lin, Lin! Please! Please! Please!

00:36:21.353 --> 00:36:22.454
What the hell?!

00:36:22.454 --> 00:36:23.789
I’m sorry!

00:36:24.164 --> 00:36:27.001
I’m sorry! I just wanted the lead role!

00:36:27.001 --> 00:36:28.127
But I...

00:36:28.919 --> 00:36:33.465
I know it was a bad decision. I’m sorry.

00:36:33.841 --> 00:36:36.218
Do you still remember our first meeting?

00:36:38.554 --> 00:36:42.141
If I didn’t give you the answers
and you didn’t get anything from me,

00:36:43.976 --> 00:36:45.728
would we even be friends then?

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:49.064
Lin, you are so special to me.

00:36:51.984 --> 00:36:55.613
You believed in me even when others didn’t.

00:36:58.991 --> 00:37:01.785
You were the sister that I never had.

00:37:03.037 --> 00:37:04.037
Sis.

00:37:08.334 --> 00:37:10.169
Sisters don’t lie to each other.

00:37:10.669 --> 00:37:11.669
They don’t.

00:37:18.052 --> 00:37:21.764
Please don’t leave!
Please don’t leave! Please!

00:37:22.222 --> 00:37:23.222
Please!

00:37:23.724 --> 00:37:26.810
I’m sorry and I promise that I will change.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.646
Just give me a chance, please.

00:37:28.979 --> 00:37:30.940
Are you pinching yourself right now?

00:37:32.874 --> 00:37:35.085
You really are good at acting, huh?

00:37:36.445 --> 00:37:38.280
You fooled me once.

00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:40.699
Have some mercy on me.

00:37:41.992 --> 00:37:45.663
If you can’t respect me or this friendship,

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.334
just please learn to
respect yourself, okay?

00:37:51.277 --> 00:37:52.277
Understand?

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:56.632
- Lin. No, please.
- Let go of my arm.

00:37:56.632 --> 00:37:57.591
Grace?

00:37:57.591 --> 00:38:00.636
- Lin, don’t leave me.
- Goodbye, okay?

00:38:00.636 --> 00:38:03.430
No, please no. Lin!

00:38:04.807 --> 00:38:05.724
Lin!

00:38:05.724 --> 00:38:07.226
Wait!

00:38:10.229 --> 00:38:12.940
Lin! Please!

00:38:30.958 --> 00:38:32.538
Good afternoon, Ma’am Perez.

00:38:33.377 --> 00:38:34.795
Good afternoon. Sit down.

00:38:35.963 --> 00:38:37.089
How was the finals?

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:41.552
I’m sure for a kid as smart as you,

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:43.554
you could retake and retake the exam

00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:46.348
and you would still get the
perfect score, wouldn’t you?

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.519
I just study hard, ma’am.

00:38:51.812 --> 00:38:54.481
Do your classmates also study hard?

00:38:57.693 --> 00:39:00.585
I’m sure they’re trying their best.

00:39:01.613 --> 00:39:05.200
I called you here because
of this whole cheating

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.952
that is happening with the sound system.

00:39:06.952 --> 00:39:08.120
What do you know about it?

00:39:09.913 --> 00:39:11.429
What everyone else knows.

00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:13.132
They say that

00:39:13.208 --> 00:39:15.044
there are sound codes
heard over the speakers

00:39:15.044 --> 00:39:16.920
corresponding to the test answers

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.839
and they were broadcast
to the entire batch.

00:39:19.131 --> 00:39:20.758
Would you know who the mastermind is?

00:39:23.177 --> 00:39:24.178
I don’t know.

00:39:24.178 --> 00:39:26.847
You don’t know or you
don’t want to tell me?

00:39:29.516 --> 00:39:31.310
Lin, the issue spreads fast.

00:39:32.227 --> 00:39:34.313
I believe it was Tristan Bangkat

00:39:34.313 --> 00:39:36.273
who first noticed the sound system.

00:39:36.774 --> 00:39:40.069
He was also the one
who decoded it right away.

00:39:40.903 --> 00:39:44.656
Weren’t you two the first to finish?

00:39:45.365 --> 00:39:47.367
Before the codes were discovered?

00:39:50.412 --> 00:39:52.456
So, is it Bangkat, Lin?

00:39:55.709 --> 00:39:57.628
I don’t have an answer to that.

00:40:00.839 --> 00:40:04.510
I hope for your sake and
your future here in this school

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:06.553
you are saying the truth.

00:40:09.431 --> 00:40:10.766
Bank, please come in.

00:40:16.688 --> 00:40:19.566
Lin denies her involvement in the cheating.

00:40:19.566 --> 00:40:22.027
So, basically, she’s accusing you.

00:40:22.486 --> 00:40:24.071
Do you have anything to say about that?

00:40:24.071 --> 00:40:25.408
Is it Lin? What is it?

00:40:31.245 --> 00:40:32.871
Tristan, are you the mastermind?

00:40:32.871 --> 00:40:34.307
I’m talking to you, please.

00:40:37.876 --> 00:40:38.876
No, ma’am.

00:40:41.046 --> 00:40:42.256
So, if it’s not you,

00:40:42.881 --> 00:40:44.550
it’s Lin, is that right?

00:40:54.101 --> 00:40:57.437
As the top performing
students in this school,

00:40:59.273 --> 00:41:01.316
here, your report cards, read them.

00:41:01.733 --> 00:41:02.733
Just a reminder.

00:41:03.277 --> 00:41:05.404
I’ll repeat the question,

00:41:06.238 --> 00:41:10.534
who among you is the mastermind
behind the cheating incident?

00:41:14.913 --> 00:41:16.415
If neither of you admits,

00:41:16.415 --> 00:41:17.971
both of you will be punished.

00:41:31.263 --> 00:41:32.361
Who is it?

00:41:32.598 --> 00:41:34.099
You have no evidence.

00:41:35.267 --> 00:41:37.978
And it’s not fair that you’re forcing us.

00:41:41.523 --> 00:41:43.358
So answer me, who is it?

00:41:57.039 --> 00:41:59.625
If no one will take accountability,

00:42:02.628 --> 00:42:03.921
I will choose for you.

00:42:07.424 --> 00:42:09.176
Bangkat, you are no longer a scholar.

00:42:09.176 --> 00:42:10.189
Understood?

00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:19.228
Ma’am Perez, that’s not right.

00:42:21.104 --> 00:42:22.814
Bank has done nothing wrong.

00:42:26.318 --> 00:42:27.385
Fine.

00:42:27.736 --> 00:42:28.791
I’ll admit it.

00:42:37.704 --> 00:42:38.704
Me.

00:42:41.166 --> 00:42:42.926
I was the one who leaked the answers.

00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:05.274
Well, then Tristan you may leave.

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:09.110
Go ahead, please.

00:43:25.335 --> 00:43:26.670
Mr. Estrella, please come in.

00:43:32.968 --> 00:43:34.678
What happened,
is there something wrong?

00:43:35.637 --> 00:43:37.180
I’m very sad to inform you.

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.682
I’m sorry, I’ll go straight to the point.

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:40.069
But your daughter has

00:43:40.267 --> 00:43:44.646
admitted to being the mastermind
of a cheating incident here in school.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.691
And it is the first time

00:43:48.275 --> 00:43:49.901
that this level of cheating

00:43:50.402 --> 00:43:52.195
has ever happened in Possenti.

00:43:54.507 --> 00:43:55.507
Lin,

00:43:57.117 --> 00:43:58.117
is this true?

00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:06.460
An offense this serious has consequences.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.337
If you tell me now, Lin,

00:44:08.337 --> 00:44:09.755
who else was involved,

00:44:10.547 --> 00:44:12.674
I may consider leniency.

00:44:15.427 --> 00:44:17.054
But if you don’t cooperate,

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:19.389
the disciplinary actions
against you will continue.

00:44:19.765 --> 00:44:21.266
I hope you understand that, Lin.

00:44:22.809 --> 00:44:23.809
Lin.

00:44:28.023 --> 00:44:29.316
just speak up.

00:44:35.155 --> 00:44:36.323
There’s no one else.

00:44:38.158 --> 00:44:39.158
It’s just me.

00:44:42.907 --> 00:44:43.805
And

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:45.332
there’s no way for me to know

00:44:45.332 --> 00:44:47.667
who among them copied my answers.

00:44:58.845 --> 00:44:59.845
Yes,

00:45:01.765 --> 00:45:03.058
I leaked the answers

00:45:03.558 --> 00:45:05.227
to help others.

00:45:06.144 --> 00:45:08.021
And I deserve the punishment.

00:45:09.089 --> 00:45:10.123
But,

00:45:10.148 --> 00:45:12.734
but all my grades came from my own effort.

00:45:13.026 --> 00:45:15.195
Well, look how you
wasted your intelligence.

00:45:16.738 --> 00:45:17.756
Too bad.

00:45:17.781 --> 00:45:19.282
What a waste, Lin.

00:45:19.825 --> 00:45:22.619
There are so many students
who could have been scholars.

00:45:25.205 --> 00:45:26.456
Well then, Linette Estrella,

00:45:26.456 --> 00:45:28.750
your application for the
Miller Grant is revoked.

00:45:29.709 --> 00:45:31.503
But I already submitted the form.

00:45:33.588 --> 00:45:35.048
I prepared for that.

00:45:35.632 --> 00:45:37.801
As long as the semester isn’t over,

00:45:37.801 --> 00:45:39.253
no decision is final.

00:45:40.262 --> 00:45:41.638
We can easily withdraw

00:45:41.638 --> 00:45:45.308
the endorsement letter and
the certificate of good conduct.

00:45:46.351 --> 00:45:48.395
With all due respect, Ms. Perez.

00:45:50.188 --> 00:45:53.692
We will accept whatever
punishment and decision you make.

00:45:53.692 --> 00:45:57.028
But maybe you could avoid dragging
the child’s scholarship into this.

00:45:57.863 --> 00:46:00.574
Mr. Estrella, this is the Possenti way.

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:02.242
Integrity.

00:46:04.035 --> 00:46:05.370
Common sense, please.

00:46:05.787 --> 00:46:07.971
She should stand by what she did wrong.

00:46:08.415 --> 00:46:09.916
Cheating, Mr. Estrella.

00:46:12.836 --> 00:46:14.588
Integrity here in Possenti.

00:46:16.339 --> 00:46:17.354
Really?

00:46:17.888 --> 00:46:18.893
Since when?

00:46:21.529 --> 00:46:23.906
How much are you charging our parents?

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:27.434
How many bribes have
passed through this office.

00:46:27.459 --> 00:46:28.518
- Lin.
- Mr. Estrella,

00:46:28.518 --> 00:46:30.729
if you won’t discipline your daughter,

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:32.709
the school itself will.

00:46:32.734 --> 00:46:33.861
- But, ma'am.
- We're sorry.

00:46:36.902 --> 00:46:39.654
She will apologize for everything she said.

00:46:40.071 --> 00:46:41.448
Well then, I’d like to hear it.

00:47:02.886 --> 00:47:03.886
Okay.

00:47:06.806 --> 00:47:07.849
I’m sorry, ma’am.

00:47:09.351 --> 00:47:10.810
I hope you can forgive me.

00:47:27.244 --> 00:47:30.956
Ms. Perez, we are ready to accept
whatever your decision will be.

00:47:39.422 --> 00:47:40.465
As Catholics,

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.136
that’s what we do, don’t we?

00:47:45.762 --> 00:47:46.930
We forgive.

00:47:49.099 --> 00:47:50.517
As educators though.

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:56.189
We have standards to uphold
and kindness has its limits.

00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:06.116
Possenti! Are you ready?!

00:48:07.742 --> 00:48:09.202
Everyone on three!

00:48:09.202 --> 00:48:12.372
Three! Two! One!

00:48:13.415 --> 00:48:17.961
Linette Estrella, you are suspended
for the rest of the semester.

00:49:16.517 --> 00:49:18.829
I’m so happy to hear your voice again.

00:49:19.606 --> 00:49:20.649
How are you, Lin?

00:49:21.775 --> 00:49:23.568
Pat, sorry.

00:49:24.524 --> 00:49:26.401
Thanks for inviting me to meet up.

00:49:26.738 --> 00:49:28.573
I really wanted to talk about us.

00:49:28.573 --> 00:49:30.197
I want you, Grace,

00:49:31.779 --> 00:49:35.116
to go with Pat to study
at Boston University.

00:49:35.141 --> 00:49:37.560
Ma, why are you so insistent?

00:49:37.721 --> 00:49:39.463
Do you want to make your illness worse?

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.878
Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?

00:49:41.903 --> 00:49:42.946
I have a client

00:49:43.626 --> 00:49:46.174
who needs a stand-in for the STIC exam.

00:49:46.322 --> 00:49:47.439
Your full name?

00:49:47.547 --> 00:49:48.881
Grace Anne L. Dizon.

00:49:49.668 --> 00:49:50.838
And date of birth?

00:49:51.166 --> 00:49:52.751
February 21, 2007.

00:49:52.776 --> 00:49:54.444
I can’t do this alone.

00:49:54.612 --> 00:49:56.165
Someone has to help me.

00:49:56.393 --> 00:49:58.025
Who else is as good as you?

00:49:58.097 --> 00:50:00.423
Don’t you earn from leaking exam answers?

00:50:02.956 --> 00:50:04.626
Teach me.
