"Doctor's Mine"
(Episode 4)

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.328
Be careful, it's sharp!

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.960
Ready? Action!

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.000
Look at that! It's Romeo,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.664
the coward of the Montagues.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.480
And there's Tybalt, the scum of the Capulets!

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.808
You're so mouthy, Romeo! Then die here!

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.448
Ahhhh!

00:02:25.472 --> 00:02:25.936
Hey!

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.752
Hey Per.

00:02:26.768 --> 00:02:27.952
Hey Per, I'm sorry!

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.592
Ah!

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.712
Are you badly hurt?

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.416
Looks like you'll need stitches.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.288
Do I need to stitch?

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.632
I'm scared of needles.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.216
What the fuck did you scared of needles?

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.016
Hey guys! Help me take him to the hospital.

00:02:45.688 --> 00:02:46.784
Let's go,

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.456
we can check it out later.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.744
Mild, what's up?

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.776
Wait a moment.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.448
Give me your hand.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.784
Why didn't you say anything when you're hurt?

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.944
I wasn't aware., I saw Per was hurt more so I was shocked.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.056
You should worry about yourself too.

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:15.540
Are you mad at me?

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.944
No.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.072
Are you mad at me? Hmm?

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.656
I'm not mad.

00:04:54.384 --> 00:04:55.600
I just don't like it.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.768
If you can't even take care of yourself,
how can you take care of anyone else?

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.184
It has happened once before, when P'Mud punched you.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.560
Mild, I'm sorry.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.312
You don't need to apologize to me.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.664
If you really like me.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.640
You need to take good care of yourself.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.864
Can you promise me?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.040
I promise.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.008
Thank you for caring.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.080
Good that you realize it.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.752
Ahhh!!

00:06:34.904 --> 00:06:36.750
Hey! Does it hurt?

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.256
Bear with it.

00:06:38.304 --> 00:06:39.776
Because you're heavy-handed.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.312
I'm the person with the lightest hand in my class.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.544
How's lighted? Look, it hurts so much.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.944
Does it hurt anywhere else? Patient Per.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.568
It hurts here too. Can you blow on it for me?

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.128
Too much, turn away.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.736
Don't let the wound get wet for 2 days.

00:07:14.784 --> 00:07:18.224
Two days? It's going to stink, then!!

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:24.168
Patient Per, you can just sponge yourself down!

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.040
I don't know how. Can you take care of me?

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.768
Oh, no one would believe it!

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.360
Just pretend to believe me, okay?

00:07:35.392 --> 00:07:37.112
I beg you now.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.968
Please, please.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.448
Sponge me down please.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.384
Alright! Just for two days, okay?

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.072
You're too cute.

00:07:57.328 --> 00:07:58.304
Hey Klah!

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.672
Hey Klah!

00:08:03.144 --> 00:08:05.784
Do you wanna play like this? Okay!!

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.216
Are you gonna turn around and talk nicely,
or do you want to die with a broken neck?

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.928
You ass! Let me go!

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:15.584
What do you want?!

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.312
You should apologize to me.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.600
I don't want to be mad at you for long.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.200
What did I do wrong?

00:08:23.976 --> 00:08:25.980
You said that P'Pat can't be trusted.

00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:28.860
I didn't say she can't be trusted.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.432
I just told you not to tell our story to other people.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.984
That "Other people" is my girlfriend!

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.712
You're biased.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.960
I'm not biased. I'm the one who sees clearly.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.712
It's just you who's blind.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.240
She's my girlfriend, Klah. Be careful what you say.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.312
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.144
That's all.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.712
I'm sorry too.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.456
Being mad at you is exhausting, seriously.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.608
Then don't fight, dude.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.504
Yeah.

00:09:05.696 --> 00:09:09.600
For P'Pat You shouldn't be so biased against.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.488
That's just how she is.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:13.968
Okay.

00:09:21.336 --> 00:09:23.340
Oh, where's Mild?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
He went to see his boyfriend.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.168
Boyfriend?

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.056
Ahh.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.968
Oh, Mild! Are you here to see Knight?

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.176
Uh nothing, actually...

00:10:08.216 --> 00:10:12.336
Come on, The Engineering faculty is like a second home
for engineering students' boyfriends.

00:10:12.384 --> 00:10:13.824
No need to be shy.

00:10:13.856 --> 00:10:15.000
He's not my boyfriend.

00:10:16.288 --> 00:10:16.840
I don't believe.

00:10:16.856 --> 00:10:18.840
Mild, do you come to see me?

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.016
What kind of tone is that?

00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:24.832
With us, he chases us away like pigs and dogs!

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.424
Doctor, He only talks to you in that tone.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.968
You guys talk too much. Go away!

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.600
Damn it, I'm annoyed.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.784
You come to see me, is everything okay?

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.064
How's your wound?

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.744
What are you smiling about?

00:10:53.776 --> 00:10:56.888
I'm glad to see you worried about me too.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.520
I just came to see my patient, that's all.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.816
Wow! You're almost recovered!

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.992
Just a few more days of applying the medicine and you'll be fine.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.336
I guess I got good medicine then.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.080
Okay then, I'm leaving now.

00:11:17.136 --> 00:11:18.136
Come on, I'll walk you out.

00:11:18.168 --> 00:11:20.936
Hey, no need.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.288
I have to read for my exam tomorrow.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.080
So what about tomorrow?

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.512
I have to read tomorrow too.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.408
Oh... so we won't get to see each other much then?

00:11:35.288 --> 00:11:37.290
Hmm... probably yes.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.856
Oh... don't make it seem like the end of the world!

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.752
I'm just taking my final exams, it's okay.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.552
I can wait.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.808
Hey Kan!

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:25.776
What's up, guys?

00:12:28.184 --> 00:12:30.568
Uh, wanna go for lunch?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.176
I... I'd rather not.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.032
I'll stay and keep studying.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.000
Ah.

00:12:42.032 --> 00:12:44.030
I'm planning to stay and study too.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.112
Can you buy some for us?

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.624
Alright then.

00:12:52.656 --> 00:12:55.936
Then we'll have Pad Krapow as usual.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.216
Okay, I'm leaving then.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.064
What's up, Great?

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.072
Can I talk to you?

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.224
I think you probably know how Nat feels about you.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.160
Great, just say what you need to say.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.880
What do you think about Natcha?

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:40.360
Natcha is my friend.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.168
Then would you be willing to give her a chance
to be more than a friend?

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.968
I don't want to lose a friend.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:54.392
I don't have many friends.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.952
Did a star of faculty like you have few friends?

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.936
Great, but I only have you guys as true friends.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:08.808
But I think you have to keep your distance for now.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.232
It's my fault for not stopping her at all.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.784
She wants to try just one more time.

00:14:21.952 --> 00:14:26.848
But every reaction you give her seems to give her hope.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.992
But I didn't intend for it to be like that, you know.

00:14:33.016 --> 00:14:36.952
I know, but she can't control her feelings.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.280
Just give her time.

00:14:41.432 --> 00:14:42.272
Okay.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.416
So, what's going on between you and N'Per?

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.984
Nothing.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:59.176
Don't hold back, I can see you like him.

00:15:01.448 --> 00:15:03.736
Yeah, good that you know.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.464
By the way, are you going out with him tonight?

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.272
How did you know?

00:15:12.424 --> 00:15:14.420
I have many sources.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.528
Hey You..

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.256
Go, Let's go to eat.

00:15:19.688 --> 00:15:20.456
Let's go.

00:15:43.848 --> 00:15:47.128
You treat me like I'm disabled. It's just my arm that hurts.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.328
Hey, don't look down on disabled people!

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.584
They can take care of themselves better than you.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:55.784
Sorry.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.288
And didn't you say that you couldn't do it?

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.976
I was actually seduced with you.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.592
Since you're all better now,
I probably don't need to wipe you down anymore, huh?

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.264
It's only temporary, It'll flare up again tonight.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.536
What are you talking about?

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.256
Enjoy your meal.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.416
Thanks.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.792
Then can I have a reward...

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.840
as a special service from Dr. Kan tonight?

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:57.232
That depends on whether patient Per behaves himself.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:08.848
I can't take this anymore.

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:11.240
I'm going to get some coffee.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.600
Hey. Uh... I'll go too.

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:16.416
Do you want anything?

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.080
I'll be right back.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:27.648
So tired.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.240
Hey, P'Knight!!

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.328
How'd you get here?

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.128
I came to see you.

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:20.240
But it's late at night already.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.096
I bought this for you.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:27.704
Thank you.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:37.432
What's wrong?

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.192
When do you finish your exams?

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.720
Uh... on Friday.

00:18:46.304 --> 00:18:47.456
Friday.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.176
So, can I come see you every day until then?

00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.944
I'm lonely.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.656
I didn't say anything yet.

00:19:07.536 --> 00:19:09.224
So, that's you allowed, right?

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.496
What is it? Why do you keep staring?

00:19:26.648 --> 00:19:28.650
May I hold your hand?

00:19:42.408 --> 00:19:43.728
Is that P'Knight?

00:19:43.768 --> 00:19:47.056
Oh, Holy shit! My stuff is on the table.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.176
Wait!

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.168
Don't interrupt them!

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.096
Yeah, Go go!

00:19:56.136 --> 00:19:57.088
Klah, nooo!

00:19:57.112 --> 00:19:57.800
Just go.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:16.824
Doctor.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.328
What?

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.224
I want to eat some popcorn.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.112
Um.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:41.720
Let me go.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:45.640
Just use your other hand.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.392
You're holding my right hand, I'm not familiar with it.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.104
Then give me your left hand.

00:22:15.696 --> 00:22:16.744
Wait!

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.120
Why?

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.784
Let me treat your wound first!

00:22:21.584 --> 00:22:24.304
Never mind, this is more important.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.480
If you don't do it, then don't.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.856
Fine, treat the wound then.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.664
You know exactly where I keep it.

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:51.320
My memory's good.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.960
I didn't think you'd actually do this for me.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.320
I don't like breaking my word.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:06.808
That's exactly why I like you.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.416
And do you like me?

00:23:18.872 --> 00:23:20.280
What do you think?

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.504
I think...

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.960
you like me.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.640
But I like you even more than you thought.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:51.960
Why are you messing with my hair?

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.424
Is the little cat awake?

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.960
What the hell cat?!

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.528
You're just so cute.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.952
Are you still groggy from sleep?

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.128
I'm drunk on my love for you.

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:19.096
Can I have a morning kiss to wake you up?

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.048
I let you do it and you're too much now.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:27.944
And do you like it?

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:30.824
Who's the one that actually likes it?

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:37.088
Don't play around, or you'll get hurt like yesterday.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.288
Who's afraid?

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:47.824
Doctor,

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.976
The gear for an engineer is their heart.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.960
Can I leave it with you?

00:34:23.368 --> 00:34:24.680
You should take it back.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.408
Why?

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.840
It's not that I don't want to accept it.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.368
But give me some time.

00:34:41.544 --> 00:34:45.440
When the day comes that you and I truly love each other,

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:49.984
I'll let you be the one to put it on me yourself.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.552
So, it's done then?

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:18.096
Well, obviously!

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.568
You're too good!

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.952
You gotta tutor me then.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:23.824
Is that my job?!

00:35:23.872 --> 00:35:25.952
Oh, don't just pass by yourself!

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.560
Hey guys, remember to collect my corpse!

00:35:36.144 --> 00:35:38.952
Yeah, I'll embalm you with formalin.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.344
You ass!

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.976
Take it easy, it'll be over soon, just a little more.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.824
Easy for you to say! You've got good morale.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.720
He comes every evening.

00:35:51.848 --> 00:35:52.736
What are you talking about?

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.600
That's it.

00:35:53.736 --> 00:35:55.160
I barely finished saying it.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:57.768
Are you done with your exams?

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.176
One more day left tomorrow.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:04.864
You probably won'tâ€¦

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:07.080
Don't worry about me. I'll finish my exams before you.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:11.128
Didn't Mild tell me to take good care of myself?

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.080
Yeah.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:18.152
Good job.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:22.392
Why are you patting my head?

00:36:23.608 --> 00:36:24.528
There are so many people around.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:30.960
If you don't like it, just push my hand away then. Huh? See?

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.888
Don't be so cute, huh!

00:36:41.408 --> 00:36:42.864
Who's cute?

00:36:46.088 --> 00:36:48.090
Are you free after your exam tomorrow?

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:54.528
Yeah, I'm free.

00:36:54.776 --> 00:36:56.530
Okay, then I'm booking you.

00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:58.328
Why?

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.984
I'm not telling. I'll pick you up tomorrow.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:05.720
Study hard for your exam,

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.272
and eat some snacks too.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:15.136
Hey, someone can't stop smiling.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.264
You like him, don't you?

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.264
Like him? No way in hell!

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.656
Hey Mild, just accept it.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.928
I feel bad for P'Knight, He has to come flirt with you every evening.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.000
Seriously, I'm asking you for real now.

00:37:30.352 --> 00:37:32.230
Don't you like him?

00:37:32.256 --> 00:37:33.640
Why are you so hard to get?

00:37:51.424 --> 00:37:52.424
What's up,

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.616
Yeah, I've finished the exam, I'm on my way back home now.

00:38:00.456 --> 00:38:02.460
See you at home, you don't have to pick me up.

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:08.992
His voice changed just like that!

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.056
Dr. Kan, could you please sign these documents?

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:20.960
Sure.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:23.120
Kan.

00:38:24.856 --> 00:38:27.696
Natcha, aren't you off duty today?

00:38:29.528 --> 00:38:31.530
I come to see you.

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:43.150
How's it going between you and N'Per lately?

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:46.792
Why do you ask?

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.728
I see you going with him often.

00:38:50.768 --> 00:38:53.720
People keep posting about it on the page, do you even know?

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.184
Really?

00:38:57.216 --> 00:38:57.976
Umm.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:03.392
People are gossiping a lot,
they are saying you've already date with N'Per.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:08.136
I think people here just talk nonsense.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.000
Everyone knows N'Per is a playboy.

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:13.760
They're probably just using you to create some buzz, you just...

00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:14.510
Natcha,

00:39:16.872 --> 00:39:18.510
Per isn't like that!

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:24.512
If you don't know Per well enough, don't talk like that.

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.088
Why are you getting so angry on his behalf?

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.752
I'm just telling the truth.

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:38.152
What did I do wrong?

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.208
You're just infatuated with that kid.

00:39:42.248 --> 00:39:43.216
Do you want to get cheated on?

00:39:43.264 --> 00:39:43.792
Natcha!

00:39:43.816 --> 00:39:44.288
Huh!

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.776
I'm leaving then.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.368
I like you.

00:39:54.888 --> 00:39:56.890
I liked you before that kid,

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.152
before Namfah.

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.808
I know what you like,

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:15.328
what your flaws are, what your good points are.

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:25.456
Can't it be me?

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.848
I'm sorry.

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:44.336
I think we should take a break for a while.

00:40:53.872 --> 00:40:55.870
I still want to be friends with you.

00:42:13.744 --> 00:42:16.608
Doctor, your love is here to pick you up.

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.080
Who hurt you?

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.680
I'm the one who hurt her.

00:42:49.792 --> 00:42:51.790
I made my friend sad.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.488
I really don't know what to do anymore.

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:43.064
The exams are finished!

00:43:43.096 --> 00:43:44.296
Yay!!!

00:43:44.328 --> 00:43:45.376
We have to celebrate!

00:43:45.408 --> 00:43:45.928
Let's do it.

00:43:45.952 --> 00:43:47.808
I'm ready, my outfit's ready.

00:43:47.832 --> 00:43:49.888
So, where should we go, Mild?

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.120
Yeah, where?

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:54.200
P' Knight.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.584
Oh! Someone's waiting!

00:43:59.648 --> 00:44:00.736
Hey, let's go.

00:44:00.792 --> 00:44:02.072
How's that, then?

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.992
Let's go, I guess we'll have to postpone it.

00:44:09.024 --> 00:44:10.768
Yeah, I think so.

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:12.856
There's only two of us left.

00:44:12.888 --> 00:44:14.144
You're done with your exam, right?

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:15.744
Yes.

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.504
Have you been waiting for a long time?

00:44:18.536 --> 00:44:19.928
No, just a moment.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.408
Shall we go now?

00:44:22.632 --> 00:44:23.608
Where to go?

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.608
Hey P' Knight, please take care of my friend.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.344
Please take care of him.

00:44:30.376 --> 00:44:31.424
Good luck, Mild.

00:44:31.456 --> 00:44:32.872
Bye-bye!

00:44:32.896 --> 00:44:34.256
See you my friend.

00:44:58.664 --> 00:45:00.640
So where are we even going?

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.952
Samoeng.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.480
Hey! Isn't this kidnapping?!

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.800
Hey! Consider it a vacation after your exams.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.432
Are you planning to fatten me up and then eat me?

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:37.320
Can I?

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.032
Not like that!

00:46:24.952 --> 00:46:29.712
Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I give to you

00:46:29.752 --> 00:46:34.784
Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I dedicate to you

00:46:34.816 --> 00:46:37.256
Whenever I turn, I see you

00:46:37.288 --> 00:46:40.024
Because you are the answer

00:46:40.056 --> 00:46:43.936
And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else..

00:46:43.976 --> 00:46:49.184
Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I give to you

00:46:49.208 --> 00:46:54.040
Can I call you "My Babe"? Because my whole heart I dedicate to you

00:46:54.088 --> 00:46:56.696
Whenever I turn, I see you

00:46:56.744 --> 00:46:59.488
Because you are the answer

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:04.080
And I won't give the word "love" to anyone else, except for you

00:47:04.128 --> 00:47:08.656
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

00:47:08.688 --> 00:47:13.464
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:17.936
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

00:47:17.976 --> 00:47:20.448
Can I call you "My Babe"?

00:47:23.192 --> 00:47:27.880
Can I call you "My Babe"? Love, love, love

00:47:46.528 --> 00:47:48.530
Are you secretly preparing something like this?

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:55.984
The stars are beautiful.

00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.600
Yeah, and...

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:03.552
Have you ever used a star map?

00:48:06.192 --> 00:48:08.190
My dad bought one for me along with a telescope.

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:11.512
Wow, that's cool!

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:14.504
I've never seen the stars up close.

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:19.952
But the person who bought them for me
never came to watch the stars with me, not even once.

00:48:20.616 --> 00:48:22.620
I don't even know why I have them.

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.416
P'Knight.

00:48:29.672 --> 00:48:32.312
Well, here it is. Mild's here to watch with me now.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.936
Okay, if next time you come, just tell me.

00:48:42.184 --> 00:48:43.464
I can always come.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:51.528
But actually, there's another reason I brought you here.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:53.088
Huh?

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:11.648
I've always thought that if I had expressed myself enough in the past.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.360
Mild would have truly believed my words.

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:21.184
But this time, I'm going to make it clear.

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:03.208
I like you.

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.112
I've always liked you.

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.112
I've never changed my mind.

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.240
Start over with me, okay?

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.832
Would you like to try? In my world

00:50:53.864 --> 00:50:55.696
Where it's just us, having fun all day

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.200
If you dare to step in and compete

00:50:57.232 --> 00:50:59.416
I'll shower you with so much love
you won't be able to take it all

00:50:59.448 --> 00:51:01.488
If you dare, I'll take care of you

00:51:01.528 --> 00:51:03.216
Even if it's hard, I don't care

00:51:03.256 --> 00:51:05.136
Just open your heart to a new world

00:51:05.168 --> 00:51:06.808
I promise you won't regret it

00:51:06.856 --> 00:51:09.200
Do you dare? Uh uh oh oh

00:51:09.256 --> 00:51:11.544
To walk together

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:14.024
Are you scared? Uh uh oh oh

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:16.640
Will you agree? Uh uh oh oh

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.184
To love me every day

00:51:19.216 --> 00:51:23.536
Just hold my hand and we'll go together

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.800
Uh uh oh oh

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:29.352
Do you dare? Uh uh oh oh, Uh uh oh oh

00:51:29.384 --> 00:51:33.456
Do you dare? Uh uh oh oh, Uh uh oh oh

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.872
Do you dare? Uh uh oh oh, Uh uh oh oh

00:51:40.904 --> 00:51:44.624
Do you dare? Uh uh oh oh, Uh uh oh oh

00:51:44.648 --> 00:51:48.528
Do you dare? Uh uh oh oh, Uh uh oh oh
