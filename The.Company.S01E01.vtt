00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.380
(Qin Residence)

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.400
Young Master.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.840
It's getting late.

00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:57.422
You should put on another layer.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.150
Never mind.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.540
(Qin Ziyi)

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.230
The blizzard will only get worse.

00:01:05.355 --> 00:01:07.350
Shall we move to
Her Majesty's room to warm up?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.640
You may leave first.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.150
I'm not cold.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.040
Yes.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.560
(Bizhi,)

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.760
(I'm trapped in a clan dispute.)

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.920
(I bear the weight of my crimes.)

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.000
(The road ahead is long.)

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.070
(Take care of yourself.)

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.200
(May you remain unharmed.)

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.840
(And beware of the cold.)

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.220
(Bizhi)

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.690
Withdraw now!

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.550
Move!

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.960
Go!

00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:40.590
I told you to stay
at the residence and protect Ziyi?

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.520
Why are you here?

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.150
What are you doing?

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.520
(Huo Shu, retainer of the Qin family)
He ordered me to protect you.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.590
General Huo.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.710
I'm not Huo Shu right now.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.800
Right now, I'm you!

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.488
Go, now!

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:53.510
We're leaving together.

00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:55.190
Young Master needs you to save his life.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.590
Go!

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.470
Over there!

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.310
Su Rou.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.510
(We travel thousands of miles apart.)

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.390
(Mountain after mountain
separates us from our old woods.)

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.950
(The old woods are no longer in sight.)

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.000
(Old bonds grow deeper in solitude.)

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.600
(All my life, I held to one conviction.)

00:04:49.311 --> 00:04:50.750
(Though a thousand miles apart,)

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.000
(may we each travel in peace.)

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.000
(Ziyi.)

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.870
(I've obtained the testimony.)

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.830
(I can prove your innocence now.)

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.830
(Why didn't you wait for me?)

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.390
(Why?)

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.700
(Yashe)

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.300
(Away)

00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:05.500
(Yashe)

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.711
=The Company=
=Season 1=

00:07:32.733 --> 00:07:35.940
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.820
=Episode 1=

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:55.660
(Yashe)

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.700
(Ninghai City)

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.220
(Yashe)

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.160
(I am Bizhi.)

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:33.670
(The owner of
Yashe antique shop.)

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.630
(It is now the twenty-first century.)

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.870
(A time unfamiliar to me.)

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.360
(Do they have this flower here as well?)

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.120
(It seems spring is in full bloom.)

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.670
(I've arrived at the right time.)

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.200
Come on. Take a look.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.750
Sir, take a look at this one.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:19.710
Look at this.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:20.870
A jade pendant.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.320
Exceptional quality.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.670
Everything I sell here is genuine.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:25.459
Take your time.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.990
I'll definitely give you a fair price.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.870
This one is a Qing-dynasty
replica of Jun ware,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:29.710
a twin-handled vase.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:30.600
A fixed price of 50,000.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.150
It's a premium tribute porcelain
from the Tang-dynasty Yue kilns.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.990
Look at the base.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.840
Look at the glaze.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.150
Pick it up and feel it yourself.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.030
Go on.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.320
Even if it's a replica,

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.960
it is still an object.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.670
This time, hold it carefully.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.120
The sword of King Goujian of Yue.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.000
There were several of them.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.870
All famed swords of the realm.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.480
The man who forged them

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.390
was called Ou Yezi.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.360
It's said that once,

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.720
while Ou Yezi was forging a sword,

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.120
with a sudden plunge,

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.080
he fell straight
into the forging furnace.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.870
From that moment on,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.030
he and the sword

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:08.630
became one.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.270
He became the sword's spirit.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.150
This blade cuts through anything.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.080
It can win any battle.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.320
And now...

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.030
it is

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.750
in my hand.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.560
Give me a break.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.910
Haven't you been swindled again, Dong?

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:24.750
Look.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.600
I'm telling the truth!

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.000
That's King Goujian of Yue!

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.320
You know who he is, right?

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.390
What he said is true.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.320
Everyone knows
Ou Yezi forged only five swords.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.750
They were Zhanlu,

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.590
Juque,

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.240
Shengxie, Yuchang,

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.110
and Chunjun.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.320
But in fact, he forged a sixth.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.960
That sword brings misfortune,

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.670
so it was never given a name.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.480
Collecting treasures

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.150
is all about the art of concealment.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:56.510
Master Dong,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.000
I've long heard of you.

00:10:58.977 --> 00:11:00.870
To judge an object,
one must know the person.

00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:01.810
A pleasure to meet you.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.870
The pleasure is mine.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.320
Gentlemen,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.150
I've got a VIP client today.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.080
Please excuse me. Let's wrap it up.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.470
That's it, everyone. Come on.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.733
(Private Negotiation Area)

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.550
Sir, how should I address you?

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.600
My name is Bizhi.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.110
Mr. Bi,

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.360
please have a seat.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.390
Bi is not my surname.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.990
Please, sit.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.240
Here.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.080
Have some tea.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.720
Your bronze sword

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.080
has caught my interest.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.360
Would you sell it to me?

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.390
That sword

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.470
is not for sale.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.110
How about this?

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.670
Try something else.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.680
Have some tea.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.630
You can't show your money here.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.670
Too many eyes are watching.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.230
Sir,

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.200
this isn't about the money.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.120
The Twin Dragon Zichen Pendant?

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.960
This is for me as well?

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.030
Sincerity

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:18.840
lies in the word sincere.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.200
Sir, this way, please.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.480
Someone actually paid that much
for this piece of junk?

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.270
This can't be real, can it?

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:43.710
Master Dong?

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.240
Master Dong!

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.240
You

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.390
will pay with your life!

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.110
Master Dong?

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.440
Why am I here?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.910
Your finger was cut just now.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.630
I helped bandage it.

00:14:59.777 --> 00:15:01.600
Do you know
you faint at the sight of blood?

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.600
I fainted just now?

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.440
Yeah.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.510
Why does it hurt here?

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.750
You probably bumped
into something earlier.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.920
The money's here.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:11.960
Count it.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.550
It should all be there.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.390
Okay.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.840
I've secured the bronze sword.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.080
I'll take my leave.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.390
Leaving already?

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.670
I'll see you out.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.680
No need.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.840
I know the way out.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.080
Do come again.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.840
My hand's cut...

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.200
But why does my neck hurt?

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.220
Come on, take a photo.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:43.470
Come on.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.100
(Golden Liquor)
(Special Offer)

00:16:03.666 --> 00:16:05.490
Hey, handsome.
What would you like to drink?

00:16:05.888 --> 00:16:07.440
Do you have any Golden Liquor here?

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.560
Golden Liquor?

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.940
Yes. Have a seat.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.230
Thank you.

00:16:22.244 --> 00:16:23.440
This isn't the liquor I want.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.080
What I want is Golden Liquor.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.080
The liquor written on your sign.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.320
Let me get you our house special.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:31.630
Golden Coast.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:32.470
Please enjoy.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:38.840
This isn't what I want.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.155
Vermilion grass grows among
the rocks of famed mountains.

00:16:41.244 --> 00:16:42.311
Its sap is like blood.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.680
- Just mix it the way he said.
- Cast gold and jade into it,

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.800
and it forms pellets like clay.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.990
Over time, it turns into liquid.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.320
Add gold to it,

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.555
and it is called golden elixir.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.870
Add jade to it,

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.080
and it is called jade nectar.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.510
Taking either grants longevity.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.960
True Golden Liquor

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.480
is brewed from sugarcane.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.270
Its fragrance is rich.

00:16:58.311 --> 00:17:00.120
On the tongue, it is incomparably sweet.

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:01.960
Down the throat,
it turns faintly bitter,

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.640
followed by a sharp, lingering finish.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.550
It must be served in
the finest twin-handled jade cup

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.350
to be worthy of such a peerless brew.

00:17:12.133 --> 00:17:14.222
Hello. Here's the drink
mixed as you requested.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:24.240
♪Happy birthday to you♪

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.080
(This liquor)

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.400
(is the Golden Liquor I once spoke of,)

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.400
(brewed from sugarcane.)

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.510
(A rare treasure of the mortal world.)

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.110
Today,

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.830
let us drink together.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.160
Would that not be fitting?

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.480
(Ziyi was my only friend.)

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.440
(He lost his life in that great fire.)

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.160
(No matter how hard I tried,)

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.440
(I could not save his life.)

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.830
(The many treasures
he collected in his lifetime)

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.350
(were scattered across different times)

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.240
(because of my mistake.)

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.750
(Reclaiming them one by one)

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.240
(became the destiny of my life.)

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.590
The treasured sword remains the same.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.720
But the man is gone.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.830
It's okay.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.110
I can get back on my own.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.790
Bye. Remember to call and wake me up.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:23.750
We're heading off. Bye.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:24.590
Okay.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.240
How much did you drink?

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.550
Can you even stand?

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.770
Here, I'll give you a hand.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.310
Steady.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.350
Hold onto your things.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.640
Ziyi!

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.550
Is this really you?

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.830
Why are you here?

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.480
It's my birthday today.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.590
Come on. Wish me a happy birthday.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:38.920
I understand now.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.200
You're just like these artifacts.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.110
You've drifted into this time as well.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.480
That's wonderful.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.270
It's so good that you're alive.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.550
How much did you drink?

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.720
I'll call a cab to take you home.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.280
Yeah.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.440
I'll take you back.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:58.750
Let's go.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.240
No. You don't have to.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.400
You don't belong here.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.550
It's fine. I'll take you.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:03.920
You've had too much to drink.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.590
What place is this?

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.300
(Yashe)

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.240
Here.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.310
Your things.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.580
(Yashe)

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.790
What exactly is this place?

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.390
Careful.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:25.780
Come on. Sit down.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.590
I have to send you back.

00:20:31.755 --> 00:20:33.030
Take good care of yourself.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.030
Ziyi.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.300
(Days Pass and Months Go By)

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:30.750
What just happened?

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.200
Did I imagine it?

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.980
(Yongning Gate)

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.200
Why is it winter outside?

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.400
Maybe the coordinates were wrong?

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.680
This time, it'll definitely work.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.680
(Yashe)
Flowers for sale.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:02.440
Sir.

00:23:02.444 --> 00:23:03.688
Would you like to buy a flower?

00:23:03.733 --> 00:23:05.110
Sure. I'll take one.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.950
How about this one?

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.750
- Want a pack of cigarettes, Sir?
- No.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:10.750
Take one. They're new.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.490
- I really don't want any.
- They're cheap.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:13.350
Thanks.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.110
Watch the road!

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.030
I got it wrong again.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:30.960
I got it wrong.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.200
Let's head back.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.550
Was that a tram just now?

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.880
What's going on with your house?

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:44.510
What are you doing?

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.270
This time, it's right.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.120
Cheers.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.020
Hi.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.240
Who are you?

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.000
My name is Su Beilu.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.160
Beilu?

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.960
Are you an enemy from the north?

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.640
Enemy?

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.590
Where do you live?

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.830
Where did you come from?

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.880
I came from the South District,
Ninghai City.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.550
Bibo Garden, Changping Road.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.640
Building C, D3.

00:24:32.666 --> 00:24:33.840
A spy?
[*Sounds like a spy.]

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.920
Beat this spy to death!

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.000
Death?

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.310
Let him go.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.110
Run!

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:44.000
He's getting away.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.040
- Stop!
- After him!

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.950
After him!

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.070
They've got a fire lance.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.960
Run!

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.070
Over there!

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:56.200
Stop!

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.070
Sorry to have frightened you, Ziyi.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.510
But please believe me.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.070
I will get you back safely.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.750
Setting the time.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.790
You're the worst.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.790
Wait! This is a misunderstanding.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:25.640
We're not bad people.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.240
We wandered in by mistake.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.200
What do you mean, by mistake?

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.240
Don't go!

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:36.550
Stay!

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.680
Sorry, sorry.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.520
One more take.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.400
After them!

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.310
Get them!

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.830
My condolences.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:53.550
(Bronze Sword...)

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:10.420
(Days Pass and Months Go By)

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.260
(Yashe, Treasure Trove)

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.400
(Every era has its own rules.)

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.110
(Although I can travel
to any point in time,)

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.830
(once the rules are broken repeatedly,)

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.720
(disturbances to time
and space will occur.)

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.720
(I returned to that great fire
countless times.)

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.270
(Not only could I change nothing,)

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.440
(but it also caused anomalies
in the energy of these artifacts.)

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:47.830
(If left unchecked,)

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.960
(they would harm others,)

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.150
(and even)

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.270
(rewrite their fates.)

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.550
(Energy anomaly is neutralized.)

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.880
(Don't worry, Ziyi.)

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.550
(I'll retrieve all of them.)

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.880
What exactly happened last night?

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.740
(Chongle Pet Hospital)

00:29:17.688 --> 00:29:19.000
(Chongle Pet Hospital)
Ziyi?

00:29:21.977 --> 00:29:25.000
(Chongle Pet Hospital)

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.110
Chun Ge.

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.200
If we're really buddies,
switch shifts with me.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.350
(Chun Ge)
Don't try to rip me off.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.640
I'm serious. I'm not lying.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.790
I drank too much yesterday.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.720
I kept running around
in my dreams all night.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.880
I woke up with leg cramps this morning.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.640
You get leg cramps
from drinking too much?

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.550
Seriously.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.750
I had strange dreams all night.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:46.200
What are you doing?

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.310
Ziyi.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.030
It really is you.

00:29:55.577 --> 00:29:57.022
Long time no see.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.950
Buddy.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.590
You've got the wrong person.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.920
Why are you here?

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.400
I really don't know you.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.720
It's me.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.240
It's me!

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.240
Bizhi.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.030
Bizhi?

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.240
Bi...

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.500
(Su Beilu)

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.880
Su Beilu?

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.070
You changed your name?

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.790
Why didn't you tell me last night?

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.760
Last night?

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.310
I remember now.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.590
I saw you yesterday.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.550
No wonder you looked so familiar.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.960
I even took you home, didn't I?

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.920
Your place was pretty special.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.790
I thought I'd never
see you again in this lifetime.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.880
I never expected you,
like those artifacts,

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.000
to arrive at this time as well.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.030
That's truly wonderful.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.960
It's okay.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.160
I'll tell you everything

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.400
that's happened over the years.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.680
Let's leave this place first.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.280
Okay.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:02.720
Let's leave.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.440
Manager, it's him.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.510
Teach him a proper lesson.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:10.720
Ziyi.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.950
Pal.

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.750
This is a pet clinic.

00:31:13.822 --> 00:31:15.590
If you've got a pet,
you're welcome here.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:17.670
But if you're here for trouble,
not on my watch.

00:31:21.622 --> 00:31:23.240
Take her over there to see Dr. Zhang.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.550
Okay.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:25.390
Next.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:27.980
(Chongle Pet Hospital)

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.200
Hello.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.320
I'm here for a consultation.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.550
I have a pet.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:41.510
Its name is Xuan Wu.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.110
I'd like to see Dr. Su Beilu

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.480
for a private consultation.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.880
Wait...

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:56.200
You're here to get a turtle checked?

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.040
That's right.

00:31:57.355 --> 00:31:58.720
What's wrong with your turtle?

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.400
It

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.920
isn't eating.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.310
Ziyi.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.480
There's no one else here now.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.240
You can reconnect with me.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:27.800
Mr. Bi,

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.400
I really am not that friend of yours.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.640
My surname isn't Bi, Ziyi.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.510
Have you forgotten even this?

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.310
Did something happen
when you were travelling

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:37.400
through time?

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.200
Memory loss, or something else?

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.040
I didn't.

00:32:41.666 --> 00:32:43.270
There's nothing wrong with your turtle.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.666
Not eating is probably

00:32:44.666 --> 00:32:46.911
a stress response caused
by a change in the environment.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.510
I'll have Dr. Tang

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:50.244
prescribe some vitamins for your turtle.

00:32:50.311 --> 00:32:51.800
It should improve after taking them.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:53.400
You can wait outside now.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.140
(Haidong Province, Ninghai)

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:05.760
What are you doing?

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.400
This place has all sorts of people.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.480
You don't wish to draw attention.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.400
I get it.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:13.640
This is my address.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:15.960
When you feel the timing is right,

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.200
come and find me anytime.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:18.920
I'll take Xuan Wu and go first.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:27.480
These past ten years,

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.160
I've always kept our friendship in mind.

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:32.550
That you're still alive

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.270
is already the greatest miracle.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.480
I won't ask for anything more.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.030
What a pity.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.440
In the prime of his life,

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.780
yet mentally unbalanced.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.460
(Yashe)

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:04.840
Sorry.

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:06.960
I only bought you back on a whim

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.710
because I needed to see my friend.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:10.360
But you have to believe me.

00:34:10.688 --> 00:34:12.550
I'm not someone
who abandons things halfway.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:14.360
I'll treat you well.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.880
(Fish-patterned Mirror
expires on March 16.)

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.230
(Time is limited.)

00:34:29.288 --> 00:34:31.190
(It's best to retrieve it
as soon as possible.)

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.400
Yashe?

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.630
Quite a distinctive name.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.920
You did come after all.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.480
Of course, I did.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.190
You forgot your medicine.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.070
Thank you.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.840
Do you know how to
give medicine to a turtle?

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.760
Want some help?

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:54.950
That'd be great.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.240
Please, come in.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.420
(Yashe)

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.360
Where's Xuan Wu?

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:04.760
You finally remember me.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.070
Are you thinking of going back?

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:08.000
No. Where's Xuan Wu?

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.490
That's not important. It's over there.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.390
I can immediately...

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:11.400
Xuan Wu.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.030
I brought you medicine.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:17.590
It's not there either.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:18.520
Forget about Xuan Wu.

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:19.800
It's gone where it belongs.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.320
You need to go back where you belong.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:23.880
I'll send you back right now.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.000
Okay. Let me tell you
how to give the turtle its medicine.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.030
First is medicine number one.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.030
Find a bowl about this big,

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.670
crush the medicine in it,

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:34.710
and mix it into its food.

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:35.760
See if it'll eat it.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.480
If it doesn't,

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.030
use a bit of hot water

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.000
to dissolve it into a liquid.

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:43.280
See if it'll drink it.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.800
If it still won't drink,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.880
then you'll need
a thinner pair of chopsticks,

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.070
about this thin.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.710
(So he really was just here
to deliver the medicine.)

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.350
Are you listening?

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:00.440
You don't remember anything,

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:02.390
do you?

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.200
I...

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.110
I remember.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.920
We were both drunk last night.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:09.550
I walked you to your doorstep.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.360
I said I wouldn't come in,
but you insisted.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.910
Then, I helped you over to this sofa.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.630
When I opened my eyes again,
it was today.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:19.630
Then, it was the pet hospital,

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:20.960
and then here.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:33.400
Looks like you really forgot a lot.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:35.630
But it's okay.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:37.480
I'll help you remember.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:39.470
I'll go first.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.920
Dr. Su.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.880
There's something I want to give you.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.110
See if it helps you remember anything.

00:37:02.333 --> 00:37:04.000
This is the feathered cup you gave me.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:04.840
See if you can...

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.150
The important matter first.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:22.020

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:47.020

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.060

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.070
