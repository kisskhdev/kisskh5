00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.490
it's only about 4 million.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.930
Only 10 minutes left now.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.580
Then, just in case,

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:35.210
let's take a gamble.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:36.830
Put all the remaining money

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.000
into buy orders

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.070
to hold the price.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.890
Wouldn't that be too risky?

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.050
We must buy.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.980
If the Japanese keep selling
before the close

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.130
and driving the price down,

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.650
we still can't hold the closing price.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.030
According to our calculations,

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:50.880
the Japanese

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.200
should have almost nothing left.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.610
I think we can do it.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.120
Put all the remaining funds from each bank

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.290
into buy orders.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.320
Hold that price at all costs!

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.220
They've pushed the price back to HKD 3.4

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.680
and placed another 4 million
in buy orders?

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.090
Yes.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.130
They've finally gone all in.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:14.870
Nine minutes left.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.550
You know what to do.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.520
Understood.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:22.240
HKD 4.18 million in buy orders!
Any sellers?

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:23.750
Please don't sell. Please don't sell!

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:24.250
Hold on. Hold on.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.400
Buy orders executed!

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.250
Plus new sell orders of 2 million!

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:27.850
What?

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.660
All buy orders have been executed,

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.940
and there are new sell orders
of 3 million?

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:33.480
Yes.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:34.440
No,

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.500
now it's 5 million.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.220
No, 7 million!

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.550
Here come more. Nine million!

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.480
A total of 9 million in sell orders!

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:51.880
Mr. Rodrigues,

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:52.900
this afternoon,

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.310
the Hong Kong dollar has remained stable
at HKD 3.4.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.770
The market is about to close.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.270
Can we sign the contract now?

00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:59.180
No problem.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.460
We're old friends.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.700
Actually, when I said HKD 3.4,

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.900
even if it's off by a few cents,

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.220
I won't make a fuss about it.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:17.250
Excuse me.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:20.050
Hello?

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.510
What did you say?

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:29.170
The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate
has already fallen below HKD 3?

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.780
Any takers for a sell order of 2 million?

[Hong Kong Dollar; 2.61]

Mr. Rodrigues.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:31.440
Mr. Liang!

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.360
Everything has gone according to plan.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.030
Specie Bank has just achieved
a great victory.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:23.210
Dr. Tanaka,

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.350
how did the examination go?

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.750
I've just completed the examination.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.180
It can be confirmed
that the fugitive's death

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.910
has nothing to do with
those present at the scene.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:32.710
Since that's the case,

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:33.720
we won't

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.250
delay the police investigation
any further.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:44.730
We've

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.670
taken up your valuable time.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.780
Please forgive us.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.630
Let's go.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:07.360
What exactly are these guys up to?

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.200
Mr. Lok Pak,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.150
please come with me.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:11.680
Where to?

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.020
Just come with me first!

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.580
What's really going on?

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.180
What is it? What's so urgent?

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:26.300
Mr. Lin,

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.440
this is He Xian.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.590
How's the situation this afternoon?

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.620
What happened?

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.070
Tell me quickly.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:41.680
Mr. Lok Pak,

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.020
Macau's financial system

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:45.250
is about to collapse.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:03.460
[Government House, Macau]

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.040
Let's start with the current losses.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:07.610
The Banco Nacional Ultramarino

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:09.220
currently holds over 15 million

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.500
Hong Kong dollars,

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.010
which exceeds

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:15.740
50% of the bank's total assets.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.040
As for our Chinese merchants,

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.410
Tai Fung Bank alone

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.210
has purchased HKD 20 million.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.350
Along with Wing Lung Bank, Tianxiang Bank,

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:26.950
Hengyi Bank, and other Chinese banks,

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.000
the total amount exceeds HKD 30 million.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.140
But this has already depleted

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.270
all the assets of these Chinese banks.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:33.610
This means that

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.400
if the Hong Kong dollar continues to fall,

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.810
all Chinese banks will immediately
go bankrupt.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.240
And once the Japanese announce that
they're abolishing the Hong Kong dollar,

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.470
even the Banco Nacional Ultramarino

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.070
will not escape bankruptcy.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.430
When that happens,

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:45.940
Macau's financial system

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.360
will collapse catastrophically.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.270
The Specie Bank will become

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:51.830
the only bank in Macau,

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.490
completely controlling
all of Macau's finance and trade.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.730
[Specie Bank]

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.700
Mr. Ogata,

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.760
congratulations.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.090
Alcohol clouds one's judgment.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.870
I only drink coffee.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.680
But come to think of it,

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.280
is this small victory
even worth celebrating?

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:23.030
We've already sold over HKD 40 million,

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.440
plus what various businesses spent on
stockpiling supplies—

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.610
we've made at least HKD 50 million.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.430
That's enough to
help the Empire manufacture

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.430
over 500 Zero fighters.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.180
Moreover, Macau's finances

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.050
have been completely crushed by us.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:41.270
From now on, the Specie Bank will control
all of Macau.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.990
Isn't that worth celebrating?

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.400
What I've acquired

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.180
is not 50 million—

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.180
it's 120 million Hong Kong dollars.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.210
If we spend all of it according to plan,

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.330
what we can earn for the Empire

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.510
is not a mere 500 fighters,

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.220
but two aircraft carriers.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:05.580
Unfortunately,

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.820
Macau's market is too small.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.270
So we still have HKD 70 million remaining.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.940
In any case,
notify all Japanese businesses

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.470
to purchase as many supplies as possible,

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.670
buy up Guangdong silver coins,

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.480
and liquidate assets quietly
without disrupting

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.940
the financial market.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.790
Given the current situation,

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.170
let's discuss how to fix this.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.580
In this situation,

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:39.670
the banks

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:40.500
can only

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.200
act quickly before the Hong Kong dollar
becomes worthless—

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.050
dump as much as possible.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:46.830
Tomorrow is the weekend,

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:47.920
and the market will be closed as usual.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.290
I remember the financial exchange's

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.710
administrative regulations stipulate

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:51.890
that in special circumstances,

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:54.640
the General Economic Bureau has the right
to suspend trading temporarily.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.510
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:57.660
we can cite excessive fluctuation
in the market's

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:58.780
main trading currency as the reason

00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.990
and have
the General Economic Bureau announce

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.960
an additional 48-hour market closure

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.490
to allow the market to regain stability.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.550
That complies with the regulations.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.250
That way,

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.790
the market will be closed

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.340
for three days in total.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:12.940
During this period,

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.760
you all must come up with countermeasures.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.720
This isn't just about
saving the financial system—

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.530
it's about saving the entire future

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:21.940
of Macau.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:22.980
I'm counting on all of you.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.480
We must do this!

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:52.830
Have something to eat.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.950
How is Mr. Liang doing?

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.100
I called Dr. Ke.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.500
He said it's just
his usual high blood pressure acting up.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.050
He was on an IV drip all night.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:05.450
Mr. Ma has already
taken him back to school.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.180
Dr. Ke also said

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.340
that you left your jacket
at the clinic yesterday.

Adding 10% makes it
15 million U.S. dollars.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.310
That's not a small amount.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.500
Fifteen million U.S. dollars...

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.190
That much?

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:08.440
It's only 15 million U.S. dollars.

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:12.340
Converted into Hong Kong dollars
at the current

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:13.920
exchange rate, that would be...

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.950
Wait, hold on.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.690
For this deal, I only accept U.S. dollars,

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:18.970
not Hong Kong dollars.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:24.210
The Hong Kong dollar is the main currency
for business transactions in Macau.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.700
Mr. Rodrigues, your request

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:29.190
is somewhat unreasonable.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.610
Haven't you seen
how badly the Hong Kong dollar

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.010
has fallen lately?

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:35.320
Who knows what will happen next—

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.120
whether it will continue to drop

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:38.820
or even completely collapse?

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:39.850
I know.

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:42.380
That's merely a temporary fluctuation.

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.240
Hasn't the news already reported

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:45.860
that HSBC recently issued

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.790
only 10 million Hong Kong dollars?

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.180
So I believe

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:52.070
the Hong Kong dollar will definitely
rebound soon.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.550
Gentlemen,

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.140
if I may be frank,

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.730
the newspapers in Hong Kong now

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.380
just write
whatever your Japanese Imperial Army

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.510
wants them to write.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:03.210
They follow your orders.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.000
What if they issued

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.040
more than 10 million Hong Kong dollars?

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.280
In short, I cannot take this risk.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:11.430
Well then,

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.900
in the coming days,

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.730
I will use facts to show you

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:15.860
that the future value

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.320
of the Hong Kong dollar
will certainly rise.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:30.690
You're planning to drive up
the Hong Kong dollar's value?

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:34.740
This is Rodrigues's condition.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.090
Only when the exchange rate
returns to above HKD 3

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:39.710
will he consider cooperating with us.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:41.860
And he has promised to
keep it confidential

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.850
from the Chinese merchants.

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:47.120
We still have HKD 70 million.

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:49.090
If we don't support the market,

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:50.130
how can we use this pile of

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.330
soon-to-be-worthless Hong Kong dollars

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:54.890
to buy the rubber he has?

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:58.210
But our mission from Headquarters

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.270
is to dump
these unbacked Hong Kong dollars

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.950
and thereby control
Macau's financial system!

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.870
The mission has already been accomplished.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:10.670
Wouldn't it be safer to avoid creating
unnecessary complications?

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:11.980
It's precisely because we

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.100
need to ensure the mission's success

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.320
that I must compete with
the Chinese merchants for this rubber!

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.310
If the Hong Kong dollars in the hands of
the Chinese merchants become

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:22.060
rubber that countries desperately need,

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.190
it would be like allowing them
to revitalize their assets—

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:28.360
turning waste paper back into gold!

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:29.380
And when that happens,

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.580
how are we supposed to control
Macau's financial system?

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:36.600
So this matter

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.150
is settled.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.360
Gentlemen,

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.300
allow me to make some introductions.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.680
These two are
President Saito of Lyun Coeng Company

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:50.000
and General Manager Ogata
from Seikei Bank,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.730
which provides financial backing
to Lyun Coeng.

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.610
Here is Chairman Ma Wanqi
of Hengfengyu Bank

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:58.320
and

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.680
Manager He Xian,
representative of Tai Fung Bank,

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.680
which provides financial backing
for Hengfengyu.
