00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.560
[Given the current situation,]

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.600
[unmarried]

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.640
[women like us]

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.640
[should remember:]

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.360
[Your children have their own blessings,]

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.600
[and you have yours.]

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.960
[Often, you'll find]

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.640
[hard work doesn't pay off.]

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.160
[But not trying will]

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.120
[make you comfortable.]

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.720
Do you often

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.520
hear them

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.360
urging you:

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.120
Go for it!

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.200
Try a little harder!

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.920
This era is always

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.360
pushing you, and even

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.000
intimidating you,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.800
leaving you afraid to stop.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.480
Once you stop, you'll...

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.600
Once you stop, you'll...

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.640
I'm not asking for water.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.640
What's following?

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.520
Did I hire you to shake up the old world?

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.600

[Pause to reflect, then set sail once more.]

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.560
So there's nothing

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.480
wrong with relaxation.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.000
Pills.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.360
Where's my pillbox?

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.720
In the office.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.840
I'll go get it.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.240
Why are you

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.280
always so forgetful?

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.280
[I've noticed that]

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.240
[since]

[terrifying, sensitive,]

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.000
[and strange.]

[The slightest]

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.280
[mistake on my part]

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.920
[would infuriate her.]

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.800
[She might]

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.600
[be too anxious.]

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.360
[Now she weighs herself]

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.200
[twice as often,]

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.400
[and switches countless bathroom scales.]

[has been doubled.]

[Not just her,]

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.960
[even I'm about to break down.]

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.760
Don't you

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.200
think this room is really noisy?

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.440
The buzz of the current never stops.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.800
Xiaohe, turn off the lights.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.320
Unplug the power cords.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.720
This air conditioner is way too loud.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.400
Anran, this is the central air conditioning system.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.160
I can't just turn off this one.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.280
It's killing me!

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.240
I wish I could take it off.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.760
Anran, why not grab a bite?

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.400
You haven't had a proper meal in ages.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.920
Vitamin pills cannot sustain you forever.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.440
I'm not talking

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.320
about meals.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.320
I'm talking about the AC!

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.840
It's too noisy!

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.200
I'll get a ladder

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.960
to take it down.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.920
Just hang it here.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.360
Okay.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.280
Yeah?

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.440
Ma'am, try on this earpiece.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.120
Lower the camera.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.680
What's this for?

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.640
The director will communicate with you.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.880
Okay. Thank you.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.400
It's okay.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.480
Alright.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.400
Is this okay?

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.880
Yeah.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.480
No problem.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.480
Relax.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.680
I'm a bit nervous.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.760
It's been so long since...

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.160
Go.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.400
Okay.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.160
Okay.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.560
Xiaohe.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.120
Remind me if I

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.920
forget my lines.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.200
Okay.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.240
Welcome to

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.520
Girl Besties.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.680
Hello, I'm Lin Anran.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.120
Hello,

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.760
I'm a live streamer, Zhang Ran.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.000
It's an honor to be here.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.440
Today's topic is:

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.160
Hustle or Chill?

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.200
Hustling

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.920
leads to success.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.040
In this era of internal competition,

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.880
we're bound to hustle.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.720
Therefore, in this era,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.680
we must...

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.280
Director, I'm sorry.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.120
I'm a bit nervous.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.880
It's fine.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.880
Just keep going.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.600
We'll edit it.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.120
We should have grown

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.640
against the wind of competition.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.000
But it's caused by a vicious

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.600
cycle, which we

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.680
have no choice but to accept.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.800
The reason for such severe

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.520
internal competition

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.159
is that today's young people...

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.640
Today's young people...

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.680
It's okay to check it.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.760
Xiaohe, give me the script.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.880
Sorry, Director.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.680
I need to check it.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.120
It's okay.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.960
Just relax.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.600
You don't have to follow it word for word.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.280
It's okay to start over.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.720
Alright.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.760
Your lines are difficult.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.720
Take it easy.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.320
Is it okay?

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.440
Yeah.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.040
Three, two, one, action!

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.120
In this era of internal competition,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.080
most people choose to rise to the challenge.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.320
But beyond grinding

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.400
and skating by,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.520
some young people

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.560
choose to give up entirely.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.360
Some people lack

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.320
the means to compete, yet they refuse to quit,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.600
so they

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.600
end up anxious.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.880
Since the environment

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.240
has already caused anxiety,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.920
why choose

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.880
internal competition?

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.040
They'd better stop

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.080
to lie down.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.560
Relax and encourage themselves

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.040
to feel better.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.240
Give themselves a hug.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.480
Accept themselves, right?

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.960
I'd like to share my perspective.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.040
Many people,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.280
including my family,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.200
don't understand me.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.200
I used to work at

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.400
a television station.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.400
I looked intelligent

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.280
and proper.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.520
They asked me

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.920
why I returned to become

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.120
an influencer, a comedian,

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.520
making funny faces and dressing up

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.560
to entertain netizens.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.120
I chose to become

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.760
an influencer,

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:33.960
so I'd

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.440
giving it my all.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.280
I didn't care about the outcome,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.919
because this is

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:40.840
what I want to do.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:41.840
At present,

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:42.799
the outcome

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.159
seems quite satisfactory.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.120
When I put in the effort

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.120
and achieve

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.040
good results,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.560
I can feel a sense of accomplishment.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.000
So, there's nothing

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.400
wrong with hard work itself.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.120
When I first

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.560
started this job,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.160
my supervisor

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.920
told me

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.040
my Qiandu search index

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.720
was only

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.200
thirty.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.080
But today,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.600
my search index

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.160
is definitely

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.440
more than thirty.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.280
Through

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.520
hard work, I have created

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.160
my own value and gained

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.440
a sense of accomplishment.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.880
[Isn't]

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.520
[that a good]

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.520
[thing?]

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.400
Hi, Zhang Ran.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.080
You know my name?

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.040
I often use your memes.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.360
They're funny.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.000
You've been following me.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.520
What can I do for you?

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.800
Nothing much.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.760
I just want to ask for your advice.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.360
I've just started to be an influencer.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.200
My advice?

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.080
Yes.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.240
Actually, I've

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.320
seen your TV show before.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.720
It's really insightful.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.400
It's long time ago.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:06.800
Yeah.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:08.800
Back then,

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.960
I was selling clothes.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.760
That was about ten years ago.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.280
Later, you married a wealthy man

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.280
and moved abroad.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.600
I thought,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.480
this host

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.320
was quite distinctive.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.480
But now, you're not

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.120
doing hosting anymore.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.320
You choose to be an influencer.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.080
I find you quite interesting.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360
You're quite adaptable.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:34.680
Yeah.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.440
Fine. Since you ask for my advice,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.560
I'll give it to you.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.760
The company hired you,

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.280
because your video of

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.080
Desperate Personal Shopper went viral.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.520
This is now

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.360
your trademark.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.160
People ask for

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.840
what they want

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.400
based on this trademark.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.560
Do you know what

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.680
your followers ask for?

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.840
Me playing the fool.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.520
Exactly.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.960
I'm just wondering if,

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.880
besides playing

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.200
the fool, I can create

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.280
something meaningful

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.680
like I used to.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.840
Another piece of advice.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:15.480
Yes?

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.120
Only traffic

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.000
is your true friend.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.680
Larger traffic

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.360
means more clout.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.640
Thank you.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.080
You're welcome.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.600
I hope to see you again

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.640
at next annual meeting.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:28.800
Okay.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.960
[I believe each of us]

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.040
[has the script]

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.400
[of our own life.]

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.640
What's wrong

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.560
with being

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.000
the protagonist

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
in this script?

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.520
Better than playing supporting

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.280
role to others.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.760
This is my personal opinion.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.840
You said you want to be the protagonist.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:00.680
So, you're

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.240
saying supporting

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.240
roles don't matter?

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.640
What's wrong

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.520
with ordinary people

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.920
like me playing supporting

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.520
roles?

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.240
Anran, who do you think

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.480
represents the ordinary person

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.040
more between the two of us?

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.960
Isn't that obvious?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.480
You have no chance

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.520
to compete with me

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.080
to present

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.080
real ordinary folks.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.720
You are not ordinary!

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.040
Keep asking

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.240
about who's ordinary.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.440
I don't want to argue

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.680
who's more ordinary.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.840
But the truth is: you've never been ordinary.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.440
You used to be a host

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.680
on the financial news channel,

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.240
intelligent, dignified

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.680
and knowledgeable.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.080
But everyone

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.480
knows how I got here.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.480
Compared to you,

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.280
I'm the one who's a real ordinary person.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.200
Now you've stepped into

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.520
the world of influencer.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.200
You can deign to

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.160
play the fool

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.880
and be turned

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.320
into memes.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.440
You don't even care

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.280
about personal privacy.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.760
Isn't that

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.960
too competitive of you?

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.840
That's too much.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.680
It's hard to believe.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.360
Is that necessary?

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.880
Give Zhang Ran a close-up.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.120
I can understand

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.120
your doubts about this.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.040
You wouldn't go that far.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.080
You wouldn't deign to.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.560
With your status,

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.600
you can get

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.840
everything you want

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.000
without lifting a finger.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.200
This is reality.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.040
But I'm not you.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.480
I'm plain-looking. I'm from an ordinary family.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.320
My family

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.080
cannot help me with my career.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.400
I don't have the luck

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.560
to get rich easily.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.480
So I have to work

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.000
exceptionally hard for my future.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:36.720
Fine.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.240
Keep asking.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.520
Read the comment on the video:

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.680
[Pander to the crowd. Shameless.]

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.280
[You need to push her.]

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.480
What?

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.760
Okay. I'll keep asking.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.600
There's a comment on your video:

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.200
"Pander to the crowd. Shameless."

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.760
You claim you're ordinary

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.080
and your success is

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.480
all due to your shamelessness.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.240
Does achieving goals mean

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.640
abandoning all principles?

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.240
Or are you saying

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.680
that ordinary people

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.880
should be shameless like you?

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.120
Ordinary people should be shameless?

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.760
Of course not!

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.120
I didn't mean that.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.720
Speaking of which,

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.720
what is their

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.120
definition of shamelessness?

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.200
Is exposing

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.080
my privacy shameless?

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.000
I prefer to call it

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.760
sincerity.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.040
I share valid and authentic

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.400
information with everyone.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.360
What's wrong with that?

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.400
So you'll keep

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.400
going like this, disregarding

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.120
your and

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.080
your family's privacy?

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.120
Well,

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.440
at least I won't tell you

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.640
my underwear size.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.040
Yeah?

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.600
I agree with you that

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.920
ordinary people should have no shame.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.480
Doesn't your success

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.080
prove just that?

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.640
That is your opinion.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.760
I choose to be competitive, but it doesn't

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.360
mean I don't care about privacy.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:41.880
I decide

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.920
what to disclose.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.080
This is my own choice.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:44.840
I hope

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.960
I can be

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.000
the kind of person

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.320
who, at the end

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.280
of my life,

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.320
has no regrets.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.200
So what you're saying is,

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.680
you're going to keep hustling

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.160
until the day you drop,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:55.560
right?

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.520
There's still a long time.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.200
I don't know what

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:57.680
the future

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.440
holds, but for now,

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.560
I choose to keep going.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.680
Okay. We're done for the day.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.400
Thank you.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:02.960
Good.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:03.920
Thank you, Director.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.560
Thank you.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.760
Thank you.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:08.600
Ran, you did

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.440
an excellent job!

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:09.960
Keep it down.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.960
That was stepping

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.600
outside the box.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:13.680
Director.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.080
Zhang Ran, you did pretty well.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.560
Thank you.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.920
Was I just

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.520
being too competitive?

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:20.920
It's alright.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.000
We can still make edits.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.120
Don't worry.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.720
Leave it to us.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.760
Okay. Thank you, Director.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.720
Thank you, Director.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:26.560
By the way,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.880
are you married?

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.640
Yes.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.360
Fortunately,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.640
Anran is unmarried.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.760
The next theme

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.720
could be marriage,

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.520
like, whether or not to get married.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.440
How do you think?

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.400
Okay. Fine by me.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.200
I'll keep working.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.080
See you next time.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.840
Okay. Thank you.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.160
Thank you, Director.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:42.880
Thank you. Good bye.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.280
Let's dance!

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:51.720
Dan,

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.920
we have confirmed with Peace TV

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.240
that the show will go live at 10.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.640
Get ready.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.560
Okay.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.760
I've already

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.440
arranged for

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.720
bullet screen, video cut, and other

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.760
forms of opinion control.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.000
What are you waiting for?

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.960
Let's get started!

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.600
Ready.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.880
Log in.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.680
I'll do it.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.600
We are

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.360
already logged in.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.160
Yeah.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:14.760
Okay.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.040
Ready.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.280
[In your view, in order]

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.120
[to be better, should ordinary]

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.560
[people be shameless]

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.040
[like you?]

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.800
[Ordinary people should be shameless.]

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.960
At the time, we thought

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.200
that's a powerful line.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.320
So they put it at the beginning.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:30.800
Yeah?

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.960
Yes. This statement

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.720
is like a bomb.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.280
Yeah?

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.520
I bet they're definitely

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.640
trying to use it for marketing.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.920
No! That's rhetorical!

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.840
It can't be out of context!

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.760
Weren't you there too?

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.480
The full version is definitely coming later.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.240
This is a teaser.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:41.720
Just a trailer.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.440
Really?

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.080
Definitely.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.520
But it's a bit odd.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:46.640
It'll go viral.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.920
It has reached tenth place

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.120
on the trend.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.440
We also promoted it

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.400
on social media.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.920
Twenty minutes

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.720
until the broadcast.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.080
The followers have surpassed 100,000.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.720
Our goal today is to enter

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.440
the traffic pool of million.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.760
Once aired,

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.000
we can achieve the goal.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.920
All thanks to Zhang Ran's

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.920
topic of "ordinary people

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.400
have no shame".

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.839
[Should they abandon principles?]

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.480
[Are you saying that]

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.960
[they should be shameless]

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:19.440
[like you?]

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.200
[Regular people should be shameless.]

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.119
[So that makes it okay]

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:23.359
[for you to keep grinding like this]

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:24.119
[and trashing your own]

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:25.040
[and your family's privacy?]

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.079
[There are levels to privacy.]

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.400
[It's not like I'm telling everyone]

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.600
[what size underwear I wear,]

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:28.960
[right?]

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.400
[But your success today]

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.280
[kind of proves my point, doesn't it?]

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.640
[That's your take.]

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.960
[I choose to hustle.]

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:35.720
[In my eyes,]

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.400
[it's not that everything can be said.]

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:37.880
[What gets shared]

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.920
[is up to me.]

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.040
[I'm the one doing the grinding,]

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.000
[so I want to...]

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.320
What are you two doing? What?

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.480
Anran, our show

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.240
just hit the trending list.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:44.960
Seriously?

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.640
No. 12 on the entertainment chart.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.240
Just that one topic?

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.440
I've got wrinkles.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.200
Forehead lines,

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.160
smile lines, dark circles.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.960
My styling looks awful.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.960
My fans are going to dump me.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.440
The full episode's been up an hour.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.560
Views are solid,

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.080
but the vibe is off.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.960
Some people are clipping Zhang Ran's

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.880
comments out of context.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.000
Do you

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.720
want me to step in?

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.160
Then kill that topic.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:22.960
Pull it off the hot search.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.520
The trending isn't ours.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.080
It's from the show's team.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.360
I'll take care of it.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.240
Ms. Qian,

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.920
are the two short video clips

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.200
for Lin Anran ready?

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.160
Sorted ages ago.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.520
Next, on behalf

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.480
of our work group,

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.760
I'll walk you through

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.800
the marketing plan

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.960
for the new product launch.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:11.800
First,

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.920
we want to do an offline

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.680
multi-brand store activation,

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.680
mainly

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.320
a launch event

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.080
built around...

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.320
Sorry, I have to jump in.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.160
Why is it still all offline?

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.640
We've talked about this

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.680
several times:

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.400
this rejuvenating cream

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.480
is Lady Wan's star product

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.120
for the Double 11 livestream.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.560
And here you are giving away

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.840
buy-one-get-one,

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.800
lucky draws, spin-the-wheel prizes.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.520
And you've booked

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.080
a bunch of little celebs

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.880
to sing and dance.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.640
What's the point?

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.480
It's so tacky.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.920
Then what are you suggesting, Mr. Li?

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.720
I'm saying

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.840
we spend money where it counts.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.080
I'm not against offline,

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.280
but we need

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.440
something clever,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.480
something imaginative.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.240
Since we're doing it,

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:00.920
we should aim

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.760
for an event

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.440
with hot-search potential.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.320
You get me?

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.680
Aim for the hot search.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.320
Well, maybe you're not

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.760
very familiar with current

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.640
traffic-buying prices.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:13.920
Alex,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.840
why don't you explain...

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.680
I don't need an explanation.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.320
I don't need to know the rates,

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.400
and I'm not talking about

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.000
buying traffic.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.920
I'm saying

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.920
we put our heads together,

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.680
figure out how

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.200
to get it trending organically.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.680
Trending on its own.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.240
Mr. Li, right now

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:35.920
any kind

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.760
of marketing

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.560
that hits the hot search

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.800
follows a fairly fixed process.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.560
If we...

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.960
People make things happen.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.000
We wanted into Lady Wan's livestream,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.240
and everyone said it was impossible.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.400
But we pushed

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.320
and we got in, didn't we?

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.840
Don't be so rigid.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.920
We need something unexpected.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.880
Why don't we dig into it today?

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.600
Someone cast your screen.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.680
No, not that, kill that.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.880
Put the

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.560
trending list up.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.600
Let's study it

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.080
and brainstorm, okay?

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.600
We'll look at them one by one.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.480
I'll do it.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.080
Go ahead.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.520
Let's see how other people get up there.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.600
Did they pay?

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.960
If they did, how?

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.200
If they didn't, then how?

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.680
- Got it.
- Make it bigger.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.520
I'm half-blind with astigmatism.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:16.800
Okay.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.960
Look at the first one:

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.080
"Who's Zhang Ran?"

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.040
Zhang Ran...

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:23.840
Zhang Ran is... is...

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.600
What kind of trending topic is this?

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.600
She's an influencer.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.400
Said the wrong thing on a talk show

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.040
and now she's getting roasted.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.400
So hitting the hot search

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.560
isn't always a good thing.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.080
Mr. Fu?

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.240
Why'd he walk out?

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.120
It's fine.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.040
It's... It's fine.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.640
Have a seat. He, uh,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.320
his stomach's been acting up

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.240
these two days.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.920
Just went to the restroom.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.280
Let's...

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.640
Let's just go back to

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.280
what you were presenting.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:53.760
Okay.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.480
Turn it off.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.080
Let's keep talking about

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.120
the offline event.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.360
Go on.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:01.960
Be mindful of personal privacy.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.760
The show butchered the edit.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.280
This is malicious editing.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.280
That's not

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.480
what my sister meant at all.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.400
They ripped her words out of context

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.160
and twisted everything.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.440
She says

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.520
"ordinary people should be shameless"

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.920
and that's going to get her dragged.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.120
Ran,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.880
the "Who's Zhang Ran" hashtag

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.400
just jumped eight spots

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.080
in under two minutes.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.680
Loads of people just flooded

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.920
into our Little White Sail account.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:32.880
They're all flaming us.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.920
Leave it. I'll handle it.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:37.920
This is insane.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.720
Let's delete some comments.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.600
We're throttling the barrage on screen,

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.760
but it'll take a bit.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.280
Sorry, I didn't knock.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.080
Could you help me please?

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.560
Did you just watch the stream?

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.560
My live room's

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.440
suddenly packed

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.200
and everyone's attacking me.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.400
Let me explain

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.120
what actually happened.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:24:59.800
When I said that line

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.560
on the show,

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.200
I was throwing the question back.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.560
I said a lot of things before that,

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.200
and I never said,

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.960
"Ordinary people should be shameless",

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.760
not like that.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.800
I said more after it too,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.200
a whole bunch of context,

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.680
but they

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.280
cut all

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.240
of that out

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.160
and kept just that one line.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.320
Now it looks like

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.600
I only said

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.880
"ordinary people should be shameless",

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.360
like that's my core belief.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.600
That's not what I meant at all.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.640
Please, you have to believe me.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.240
Help me.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.640
Zhang Ran, come here.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.520
Sit, sit.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.360
Please. calm down.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.680
We believe you,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.840
of course we believe you.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.520
It really wasn't like that.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.920
You weren't there that day.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.560
Bo and the others can vouch for me.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.320
I didn't mean it that way,

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.560
I was joking.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.880
After Lin Anran finished talking,

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.560
I came in

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.080
with that line as a joke.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.400
It was part of a whole bit,

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.440
not just that one sentence.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.680
They chopped out that single line

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.400
and threw it online.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.920
That's the problem.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.800
The worst ones

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.160
are the keyboard warriors.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.520
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.640
We're already locking down

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.960
the comments on the barrage.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.960
Give it a minute.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.240
Bo can't delete fast enough.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.080
It's all abuse.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.600
Every single one is cursing me.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.760
I've got more people on it now.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.880
Trust me, okay? Trust me.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.680
When we

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.520
were taping,

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:05.840
the show told us we weren't allowed

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.880
to record on our phones,

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.320
so I told Bo,

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.560
"Fine, we'll do

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.240
whatever they say

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.160
and cooperate."

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.200
And now

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.560
they cut it like this.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.400
If I'd recorded it,

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.320
I'd have proof.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.680
I could show everyone

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.160
I didn't say it like that,

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:20.520
right?

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.120
So what do I do now?

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:22.840
What do I do?

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:24.520
Ms. Qian,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.600
this isn't right.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.720
Just so their show can blow up,

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.400
they don't care about my artist?

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.640
You're right, this is on the show.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.760
It's definitely on them.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:38.960
Don't worry.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.200
We'll figure something out.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.000
We are absolutely

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:41.960
on your side.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.160
Zhang Ran,

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.320
don't panic.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.280
We've been

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.200
in constant contact with them.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:50.680
Yes.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.480
Thank you, boss.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.160
Thank you.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.800
So what do we do now?

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.600
Everything's under control.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.120
You have to trust us.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.040
I do.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.040
I...

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.240
Go home and get some rest first.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.320
Okay.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.040
I trust the company.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.200
I trust you. Thank you, boss.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.360
When you get back,

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.040
turn your phone off.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:19.600
Okay.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.280
We are

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.720
your strongest backing.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.080
Thank you, boss.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.880
See Ran out.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.200
What do you think about this?

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.960
She still can't carry it.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.040
I don't think

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.440
she did anything seriously wrong.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.480
We should back her.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.000
Isn't it obvious?

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.480
The show set us up.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.680
This is straight-up

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.920
malicious editing.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.920
I think we should

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.480
issue a statement, now.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.680
Then what about Lin Anran's videos?

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.320
Maybe...

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:10.680
maybe we

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.800
go to the show,

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:13.800
ask for

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.960
the full uncut footage.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.280
Then we

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.080
quietly leak

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.240
the full version somewhere.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.560
That might calm

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.960
some of the backlash

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:21.760
and it could

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.320
even flip the narrative in our favor.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.120
Ms. Qian, you're missing the point.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.320
The traffic has already snowballed.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.920
A runaway horse

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.920
doesn't go

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.960
where we tell it to.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.360
If the full episode

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.480
leaks,

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.720
sure, Zhang Ran might look less guilty,

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.520
but Lin Anran could

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.240
end up in serious trouble.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.880
What she said

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.200
is the real landmine.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.000
If you put that out,

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.560
Tide Media goes down with her.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.520
We really have to sacrifice the pawn?

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.400
What would you suggest then?

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.120
In that case,

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.400
we can only

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.880
lock Zhang Ran's account.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:24.680
I'll handle it.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.160
Director,

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.920
this first episode is a hit.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.080
A real splash.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.280
Zhang Ran, go home

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.360
and take a break.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.240
Turn off your phone.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.760
Don't look at anything.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.880
Ignore everything online.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.200
Just rest.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.520
Zhang Ran?

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:41.280
Zhang Ran?

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.320
Let's stop watching, okay?

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.280
Turn it off.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.680
It's a crappy job anyway.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.920
If we don't want to do it, we don't.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.360
Online, nobody

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.680
really cares about anyone.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.280
The people praising you today will be

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.280
the same ones hurling abuse tomorrow.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.760
Listen to me, let's walk away.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.640
Go back to a normal life, okay?

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:57.960
It's okay.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.200
Whatever happens,

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.880
you've got me. I'm here.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:17.520
Come here.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.680
Tiger, you might be

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.680
king of the jungle,

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.640
but even kings end up in cages

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.400
one day.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.960
Happy with your poop-scooper?

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.320
You lot work days,

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.840
and I work nights.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.280
My shift is cleaning up after you.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.080
[Guys, can you believe this?]

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:18.920
[I can't]

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.199
[with these influencers anymore.]

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.199
[Just saw one on a show,]

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.320
[first thing out of her mouth was:]

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.920
["Ordinary people should be shameless]

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.080
[and grovel to the rich."]

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.199
Dinner's ready.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.080
[I got full-body goosebumps.]

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.040
[Like,]

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.360
[what's wrong with ordinary people?]

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.280
[We earn]

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.199
[with our own hands.]

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.280
[The breakfast lady's]

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.520
[up at 3 a.m.,]

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.239
[the guys on site]

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.520
[work under the blazing sun.]

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:38.360
[Aren't they all earning money]

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.320
[with their heads held high?]

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.679
Exactly, she's so right.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.560
You full?

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.239
Come eat.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.560
I'm watching this video.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.920
She's making a lot of sense.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.880
Everyone online's

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.120
tearing into some influencer.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.920
Why are they cursing her?

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.679
Something like, ordinary people

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.840
shouldn't care about their pride,

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.200
should give up their dignity

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.520
and grovel to rich people.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.920
"Grovel", you know what that means?

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:06.640
It's what

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.960
young people say now.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.040
What's wrong with young people's values

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:10.920
these days?

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.480
Didn't anyone

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.800
raise them?

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.640
Let me see.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.360
This one.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:23.520
Look.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.560
Fran, the peacock's gone.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.080
The peacock's gone?

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.320
[Impressive,]

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.640
[you even managed to lose a peacock.]

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.640
Can you not worry about how I lost it?

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.760
Since you're with Xinying,

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.240
have her check the warehouse next door.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.080
[Okay, relax.]

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.480
[It won't get far in this short a time.]

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:55.440
Right.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.160
You look outside the park,

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.360
I'll search inside,

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.280
okay?

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.320
You really managed to lose

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.520
a peacock in the middle of the night.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.680
Where are we supposed to find it now?

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.280
Ge Kaiyang, I say we just

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.880
find a way to buy another one,

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.280
yeah?

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.880
Please, come back.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.880
If you're gone, I'm done.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.400
Do a peacock call.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.760
You two,

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.880
get over to my live location.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.800
I see it.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.080
Got it, on my way.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:00.840
I told you

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.360
it wasn't over here.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.400
I've searched this whole spot.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.120
Coming.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:04.680
Mom,

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:05.880
Dad, come in.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:06.840
Where's Zhang Ran?

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:07.720
In her room.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.240
I knew you were unreliable.

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:19.960
All day long

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:21.440
it's you

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.000
people's fault.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.400
How is it my fault again?

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.120
Always watching videos on your phone.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.560
That's you lot, isn't it?

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.920
Mom, she didn't even eat dinner.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.440
I made some congee. Maybe you...

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.120
I'll go.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.160
Careful, it's hot.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:45.680
Ran,

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.480
have some congee.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.480
I don't want it, Mom. You have it.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.080
You need a full stomach to sleep well.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.320
I'm not hungry. Just leave me alone.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:37:59.960
You drink it.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.440
Then...

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.240
call me when you want to eat, okay?

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.080
Still on your phone.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.000
She didn't drink any of it?

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.360
These people are awful.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.240
[Boss,]

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.320
[I might be]

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:29.840
[late tonight.]

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:30.920
[Something's happened with Zhang Ran.]

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:31.960
[She's getting dogpiled online.]

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.880
[I'm going to check on Yudong first.]

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.040
[Maybe you should look into]

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.240
[what's going on too,]

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.280
[see if it's worth giving her a call.]

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.400
[Up to you.]

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.040
I just saw it here,

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.400
in this patch.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.120
There's nothing here.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.800
saw its tail,

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.560
then whoosh, gone.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.640
You sure you didn't just see a cat?

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.720
You sound like you've been stepped on.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.920
Ge Kaiyang, maybe we stop.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.640
Just buy one and be done with it?

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.400
No.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.880
This isn't just losing a peacock.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.280
I've treated it like family.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.720
I'll find it.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.480
Ge Kaiyang,

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.080
we still chasing it?

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:54.960
Yeah.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.200
If we don't, I'll stick you in a cage.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.560
We still wouldn't be

00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.960
able to fan our tails.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.480
Fine, keep chasing.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.880
[First time I've realized]

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.240
[peacocks can fly this high.]

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.080
[This high?]

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.960
[It's still a bird.]

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.320
[Aren't you scared, flying that high?]

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.040
[Sure.]

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.840
[Scared, but you still want to fly.]
