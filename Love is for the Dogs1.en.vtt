00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.450
As expected of our Shogun.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.340
Hey, Doc.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:03.880
What a coincidence.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.380
Good morning.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.360
It's you, Mr. So Ha.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.900
Good morning.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.200
You're staying around here?

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.390
No, I came here for sightseeing.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:13.940
Sightseeing?

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.970
I came to see the beach. Didn't expect to bump into you.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.210
Mr. Shirosaki, are you free now?

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.440
Let's have a game.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.460
Nah, you two are really bad at it.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.070
What the... It went in!

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.780
That's crazy!

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:43.470
- All the way from there !
- Wait, what?

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:56.070
Nice! That's Mr. Shirosaki for you.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.170
You're good, Doctor.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:00.010
I played a little when I was a kid. What about you, Mr. So Ha?

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.440
It's child's play to me. I have a court back home...

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.800
What?

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.540
I mean, there's a court in my neighborhood, so I often play there.

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.630
But I think you're amazing.

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:14.920
You're managing an animal hospital at such a young age.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.070
Nah, I took a huge loan for it.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:20.060
And you're good at basketball too.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.590
I bet you're popular with ladies... huh!

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:25.270
Nope. No way he's popular.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.110
I don't want to hear that from you guys!

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:41.740
Are you okay?

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.830
Sorry about that.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:55.570
So... you're looking for me about something, aren't you?

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.080
Oh, it's that lady...

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.550
- Thank you for waiting. Here's your ice cream.
- Thank you.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.460
- And your churros. Please come again.
- Thank you.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.680
Have a bite.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.950
- No, thank you. I...
- Just take it.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:38.200
Japanese have this bad habit of holding back. Here.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.460
Thank you.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.120
You, too.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.820
Thank you.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.570
So, why are you looking for me?

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:09.000
What brings you here, Ms. Aiko?

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.100
Well...

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:18.060
I was harsh to you that day,

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.360
so I dropped by the hospital to apologize,

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.570
but I was told you are here.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:25.200
Likewise, I was blunt with my words.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.190
As was I. I'm sorry.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.810
I apologize.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:31.740
The two of you look great together.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.140
Excuse me?

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:38.300
The beginning of a romance is the most enjoyable.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.270
You're mistaken. We are not—

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:45.880
You mean these two, right?

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.110
I knew that.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.640
What are you trying to prove?

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.950
But you two look good together, too.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.610
- Huh?
- What?

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.290
A love that blossoms through dogs.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:03.840
Eventually, you end up raising both dogs together,

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.680
till you can no longer tell which dog belongs to which owner.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.660
But it's a happy ending.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:16.620
That ending is not what I'm wishing for.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.000
What?

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.630
I don't keep a dog so that I can meet someone.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.580
And I may not be happy raising both dogs together.

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.790
I'm plenty happy on my own.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:30.940
My career, hobbies, and beloved pet.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.650
These are what make me happy,

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:36.980
and that no one can destroy. To me, that is important.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.240
So, please rest assured.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.810
I am not interested in you either. Not one bit.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.910
I can handle it. No worries.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.630
I'm glad we could clarify things.

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:09.860
Let's go, Sakura.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.330
Please excuse me.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.930
- She's weird.
- What a strange lady.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.430
Oh, right. What did you wish to speak to me about?

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:34.750
Young Master!

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.240
Young Master...

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.860
Your father called.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.400
What did he say?

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.400
That you must retrieve the dog before the shareholders' meeting.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.870
"That is no ordinary dog. It's of significant value!" was what he said.

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.030
I know that.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:02.520
He's surprisingly quick to pick up on things.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.760
What should we do?

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.110
That young master of WooRoA Group?

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:14.070
I heard he has come to Japan.

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:18.940
I was informed that we must be on standby to back him up if anything happens.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:24.280
Tell them that we will do so, with great pleasure.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.810
Yes, Sir!

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.330
Woah, someone's really fired up.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:49.130
Hello?

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.580
I didn't know they had such pretty cakes.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.120
It's my boss's favorite.

00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:00.880
Aw, Sakura. Aiko's been good to you, right?

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.260
Is Dad coming home?

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.510
I don't know if he even bothers to come home for dinner.

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:10.380
But haven't things calmed down between you two?

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.740
You no longer talk about breaking up and all that.

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:15.840
I gave up arguing with him.

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:23.400
Then why not get a divorce?

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.830
Come again?

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.560
Don't try to make others happy.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.100
You should make yourself happy.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.040
You're strong, Aiko.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.270
- You always run away like this.
- Quiet! Aiko will hear you.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.750
But if things go on like this...

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.140
- Sakura?
- What?

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:55.020
Sakura, what's wrong?

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.570
Sakura, what happened?

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:00.470
What did you eat?

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.240
[Shirosaki Animal Hospital]

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:24.700
I see something near the stomach's outlet.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.010
Did she accidentally swallow it?

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.150
- I'll do a blood test and X-ray. Prep for an endoscopy.
- Yes, Sir.

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:33.330
Let's go, Sakura. Oops, sorry!

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:34.790
I'll also prepare an IV drip.

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:36.420
Thanks.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.350
The anesthesia has set in. I'll maintain at this level.

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:14.810
Let me know when her heart rate and blood pressure stabilize.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.310
Roger that.

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.330
Move the forceps in a little further.

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.760
Got it.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.500
Doc, the heart rate.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.980
Administer more atropine, and up the level of IV fluids.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.630
Yes, Sir.

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:39.010
You can do it, girl.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.680
Hang in there.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.890
How is Sakura?

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.220
The surgery went well.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.300
She is out of danger.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.110
Please, come in.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.000
Sakura...

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.180
I'm so glad you're okay.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.160
Looks like she had ingested this.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:22.200
It's from the cake.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:27.100
Fortunately, it didn’t enter the small intestine. We got it out with an endoscope.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:30.560
Thank you for saving her.

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.720
I'm so sorry, Sakura.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.300
If only I had noticed it earlier.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.050
I'm strong?

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.300
I can handle things on my own?

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:58.240
How arrogant I was.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.610
In truth...

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:06.910
I can't even protect my dog.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.130
I'm so sorry, girl.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:18.200
I'm such a terrible owner.

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:35.310
Feel it here.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.710
Can you feel her heartbeat?

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:55.980
It's faster than a human's.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:08.710
Thump, thump, thump, thump...

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:13.840
Thump, thump, thump.

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:17.600
It's calming down.

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:24.200
Because you are here for her.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.250
I mentioned it before.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:38.750
A day to us humans is like three days to dogs.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.340
Time goes by in a flash for them.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.890
That's why they don't lie.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.800
They don't have the time for that.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:57.010
This dog loves you wholeheartedly,

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.040
and simply wants to be with you.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:14.540
Don't worry.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:21.870
She fully understands that you love her.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:29.790
You're a wonderful owner.

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:05.740
Shogun, you came to check on Sakura?

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:10.040
She is all right.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.690
Don't worry.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.190
Let's let them meet.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:23.210
Sorry?

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:29.830
Shogun and Sakura. We'll let them meet and spend time with each other.

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:39.510
I agree with you. Time is short for these dogs.

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:43.800
I want them to make plenty of happy memories.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:54.270
In that case, let's find a place where they can run around freely.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.380
Sure. Thank you.

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.290
Happy to let them meet.

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:12.160
Unlike dogs, humans lie.

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:17.100
They are cautious and restrain themselves.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:24.290
♫ ♫

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.710
In truth, they are lonely.

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:34.530
♫ ♫

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:40.770
In order to hide their loneliness, they tell another lie.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:43.960
♫ ♫

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:50.300
But dogs are honest, and love you with all their heart.

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:56.230
How liberating it would be, if we could be as honest as them.

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.830
Just like these furkids.

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:03.970
Here goes. Fetch!

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:09.400
Come on, don't ignore me!

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.550
Let me do it.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:14.060
It's useless.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.300
We won't know unless we try.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.240
It's that man...

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.020
Mr. So Ha?

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:30.840
Hi, Doc. What a coincidence.

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:35.210
A coincidence.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.400
Is it, really?

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.180
You don't look surprised.

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:51.080
♫ ♫

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:55.100
I do have something important to speak to you about.

00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:01.040
♫ ♫

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.190
Who are you exactly?

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.180
I have come...

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.900
to steal your dog.

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:09.960
Shogun, you came to check on Sakura?

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:19.420

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:21.950
Ms. Hanamura, sorry to keep you wait-

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.700
Once we have a meal, we're friends.

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.570
I refuse. I won't hand Shogun over.

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:25.190
He seems somewhat distant. I can't figure him out.

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:27.910
That's what you call "first love".
