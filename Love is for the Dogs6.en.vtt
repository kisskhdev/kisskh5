WEBVTT

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.080
My first love... was you, Shirosaki.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.480
You're the one I can't help but think about.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.590
Tomorrow, you'll probably come to mind, too.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.230
It was you back then, it's you right now.
And it will always be, you.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.740
I...

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.180
I...

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.730
I feel similarly.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.340
"Similarly"?

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.430
"Similarly"?

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.010
You come to my mind, too.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.900
You are special to me.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.600
As Dorako.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.100
What?

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.830
Dorako?

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.720
What do you... mean?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.600
You're Dorako, the girl who helped me care for a dog,
and shared dorayaki with me.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.460
And now we've bonded as Shogun and Sakura's owners.
So I thank you for that.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.820
- You're welcome.
- Alright then, see you.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.820
Kai, what's with that half-baked reply?

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.450
You overheard?

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.330
No, not at all.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.240
Please excuse me.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.250
I know.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.220
That just means that I was rejected.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.800
But it's fine. I'm just relieved that I got that all out.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.850
It's regarding Mrs. Kasuga's case.
Please review the text in the notarized document.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.210
Will do.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.840
But it's also possible that he's indirectly telling me
that he likes me.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.350
Aiko, it's Mom. Let's have lunch together.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.780
There are some things I wish to speak with you about.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.520
Come to think of it, I don't even have his number.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.010
[Woo So Ha has sent a photo]

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.820
Aiko, you forgot this.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.520
Where's So Ha?

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.880
He's busy with work.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.230
Your arrival was sudden, so I have not informed him yet.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.250
Your luggage is empty?

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.680
I need space to pack him in.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.130
Pack what in?

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.650
So Ha.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.090
Sorry?

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.530
Let's go.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.460
What's wrong with Mr. Shirosaki?

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.710
He's been at it for a while now.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:50.430
Sir, we know you have time on your hands, but please,
let Watanabe do the cleaning.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.510
Me?

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.070
That was...

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.190
My first love was you, Shirosaki.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.460
What did that mean? Was that in the past?

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.010
- Sir?
- Let me do the cleaning.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.300
What's wrong with him?

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.120
He's suddenly replenishing the supplies.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.810
Mr. Shirosaki's been acting strange today.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.090
Isn't he always?

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.730
Gosh... Mr. Shirosaki,
just leave all these trivial tasks to Watanabe.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.760
Why must I do everything?

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.600
Come on, just do it.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.640
- Please, do it.
- I'll do it.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.020
Sir, how about you go enjoy a lunch break with Shogun?

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.170
Here you go, Sir.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.390
What's going on?

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.520
You're looking for So Ha?

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.440
He's out making deliveries.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.200
Is that so? I'll wait for him inside then.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.020
Miss...

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.020
That dog...

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.400
You are Mr. Kai?

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.290
Erm, may I help you?

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.190
What was that?

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.220
Hi, Aiko. You came.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.250
I'm here for my bag...

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.850
I've kept it inside.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.090
A lot happened yesterday, huh?

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.870
Let me treat you to lunch.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.750
Wait. Now is not the time to head on in.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.080
A date?

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.460
For real?

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.450
In the first place, Shirosaki's private life
has always been a mystery.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.810
I'm surprised he's rather popular with women.

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.250
I don't even know what became of his relationship
with Ms. Yuka.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.810
Ms. Yuka has begun dating someone else recently.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.930
- Huh? Really?
- Yeah.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.830
In any case, this is awkward, so I'll get going.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.400
Hang on.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.160
What's wrong? You're not your usual self.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.650
I'm regretting it.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.200
My mind just went blank that day.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:17.020
Something welled up inside me, and my confession
came out like overflowing water.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.000
You get what I mean?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.080
No, I don't.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.570
But this much, I can tell you.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:31.680
For someone like Kai who's slow to catch on,
you have to be direct with your words.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.660
Be direct, how?

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.380
In Korean, we say, "sarang-haeyo".
In English, it'd be, "I love you".

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:43.770
But there are too many variations of "I love you" in Japanese.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.810
You must be more affirmative and direct.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.720
I like you.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.890
I'm telling you that I like you.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.680
That lady sounds like...

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.050
Nah, it couldn't be.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.100
But it is.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.640
Woo So Ha.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.850
You're So Ha's sister.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.870
Heading out for deliveries.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.840
Hang on. Where are you going?

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.240
You know that you're being really rash, don't you?

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.940
Pardon me, but who are you?

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.670
What?

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.800
You're that lawyer.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.620
The name's Hanamura. Thank you for letting Shogun stay here.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.940
Right, his sister.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.250
I was wondering who she was.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.530
Erm... So Yeong...

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.860
[Episode 6]

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.410
Kai, Sumomo isn't doing well.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.960
Bring her to the hospital immediately.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.690
- I'll leave Shogun to you.
- Huh? Sure.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.980
- Where's the pet carrier?
- In the store room. Over there.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.650
She's having seizures?

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.950
She's showing neurological symptoms.
Administer oxygen and run a blood test.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.990
- Got it.
- I'll also prep the ultrasound.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:45.890
- Prepare the emergency medication.
- Got it.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.340
Sir, her breathing is becoming more labored.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.080
Intubate her.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:59.420
We've got her seizures under control for now.
I suspect it's terminal kidney failure.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.200
What do you plan to do?

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:10.210
I'm barely holding up in caring for her on my end.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.270
Any senior rooms available at Sincere?

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.300
They're full at the moment.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.010
I'll try somewhere else.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.530
We'll look after her here for the time being.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.680
Mr. Shirosaki, you have a call.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.250
See you.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.200
Please take care of her, Kosuke.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.710
Ms. Yuka.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.730
I'll watch over Sumomo.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:46.980
Thank you.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.250
I see.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:03.560
Mr. So Ha's sister suddenly came in like a massive typhoon,

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.540
and expressed her love for that gentle vet.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.040
That's the gist of it, yes.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.530
She's what I'd call an alpha.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:20.160
Us boorish folk don't stand a chance against winners like her.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.340
They snatch away our opportunities,

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.760
and leave us broken and defeated.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.420
No, I understand.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.020
I'm already plenty defeated.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.550
Thank you for coming.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.200
No, no problem at all.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.870
It is an honor to meet you.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:48.130
May I ask what brings you all the way here to Japan?

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.490
Actually, there's something that's troubling me.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.540
She says she is troubled about something.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.440
I heard that So Ha has been active
in animal rescue efforts in Japan.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.950
He has been praised for giving up his stake in the company,

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:07.980
and rejecting financial help from his family.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:13.210
He even rejected family support to live alone.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:17.180
What? Then Mr. So Ha's reputation...

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.040
Indeed. Others hold him in high regard,

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.550
even though he was disowned by the family.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.570
He's even being touted as the next candidate
for president of WooRoA.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.790
It was one of the topics of our recent shareholders' meeting.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.680
In other words...

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:40.460
He has been nominated to be the next successor
of the WooRoA Group.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.930
That's why I flew here to find out what he thinks of all this.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.630
I want to know whether he'll come back with me
to rebuild his career,

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.040
or whether he'll remain in Japan forever.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:15:00.470
That is a major decision that Mr. So Ha has to make.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.750
I would also like to hear Ms. Hanamura's thoughts on this

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.420
before I go to him personally.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.250
How is So Ha currently doing in Japan?

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.910
Is he fit to be a candidate for president of the WooRoA Group?

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:23.600
Ms. Hanamura would certainly be the best person to ask.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.550
Let Hanamura know that we need all this info from her.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.060
Yes, sir.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.160
We will find out, and update you accordingly.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.430
Thank you.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.690
I'm back, Shogun.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:47.420
Shirosaki has frequent night shifts,
so So Ha manages the house chores on his own.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.660
Looks yummy.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.250
Bon appétit.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.550
Wow, so good.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.020
It's So Ha.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.500
Aiko, sorry to disturb you.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:38.070
I made sure to add veggies into my dinner tonight.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.780
Shy person...
["XX person" series]

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.370
Grumpy person... That's Kai.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.190
At night, he reviews his Japanese.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.200
And in the morning, he brings Shogun for walks.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.640
Let's go, Shogun. Wanna go to the beach?

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.210
Off we go!

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.970
That guy...

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:11.050
I told him not to leave the clothes in the washing machine.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.200
[Kai, enjoy!
P.S. I know you like it spicy]

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.360
Thank you for waiting. Here's a smiley heart for you.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.830
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.930
- He's really cute.
- Way too handsome.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:11.140
As you can see, he is very popular at work.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.980
He easily makes friends with everyone
in a town that's unfamiliar to him.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.800
People are naturally drawn to him.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.490
That is the most important trait one needs in business, is it not?

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.660
I agree.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.490
They can't do without the young master anymore.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.010
Is that so?

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.990
So Ha, you can go take your break.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.830
Okay.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:54.000
And here is your payslip for the month.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.820
Thank you very much.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.780
I'm so touched.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.530
Let's treat Mr. Kai to something with this.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:07.080
What?

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.280
Hey!

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.630
Please, have a seat.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.010
Thank you.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:30.420
I had you join us tonight
because I wanted to personally express my gratitude to you.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.500
Thank you for taking care of my little brother.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.110
To be honest, he's really a handful.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.650
Says you.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.680
I took care of almost everything.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.120
Nonsense. I was taking care of stuff, too.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.620
- In what way?
- Back at you.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.040
Alright, let us ー

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.000
I'll pass on the alcohol. I'll drink this.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.080
Cheers.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.630
Cheers.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.910
Mr. Kai.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.510
Have one.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.260
Delicious.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.600
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.020
So Ha, doesn't this bring back memories?

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.920
This place reminds me of the restaurant we used to frequent.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.940
The one at Hangang Park?

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.560
Yeouido Hangang Park. My favorite hangout spot.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.610
There's a restaurant there that I used to frequent.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.250
I see.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.490
What's this?

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.660
That's kkaennip. Like, wild sesame leaves.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.400
Wild sesame?

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:14.350
This is when I need someone to hold it down for me.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.990
Please excuse me. It's the hospital.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.770
Here you go.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.270
I don't need your help.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.950
Why?

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.920
Let go. I'll do it myself.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.860
Aiko!

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.140
Over here.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.920
Is it really alright for me to join in?

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.590
Of course.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.430
Because you're my chingu.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.610
How is Theo?

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.960
He's woken up, and drank some water.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.640
His condition is currently stable.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.270
What about Tora? Has his fever gone down?

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.740
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.330
It's this girl, right?

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.610
What about her?

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:22.790
She's the reason you won't go back to Seoul?

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.520
The two of you, that's a bit too...

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.260
Cheers.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.620
Cheers.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.900
You like Ms. Aiko, don't you?

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.890
What are you talking about?

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:01.530
Translate what I said.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.860
He likes you.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:19.180
That's why he wants to stay here.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.760
You're wrong.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.320
What is wrong?

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:35.980
Erm... well, I'm talking about Kai.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:45.370
Don't make assumptions. I just like the way of life here.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.180
Can't you be more honest with yourself?

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.020
I'm serious.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:03.790
You abandoned WooRoA
and turned your back against your family.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.830
All the more reason you should be honest.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.990
I already said you're wrong.

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:11.030
I...

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.750
have been dumped.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.330
Hanamura?

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.060
What's going on?

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:37.720
It was for the best. I feel completely, and utterly alleviated.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:45.590
That's right. Everything just... blew right away.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:06.290
- I'm fine.
- Let me send you home.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.420
It's fine, I'm okay. My home is nearby.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.300
But you don't look okay.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.970
I can walk home on my own.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.570
In that case... I'll watch out for you.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:27.010
♪ Sakura, Sakura, oh adorable Sakura ♪

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:31.460
♪ Her boyfriend's name is Shogun ♪

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.290
You're tone-deaf.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.840
What do you want, Shadow?

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.010
Huh?

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.780
A shadow is following me.

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.570
Yes, I am.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.040
I'm right here.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.140
You're really nice, Shadow.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.920
I'm very worried about you.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.370
Alright, follow me, Shadow.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.550
Whoa! Watch out, don't trip yourself.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.220
I hope she gets home safely.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:27.150
So Ha, come back with me.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.900
To where?

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.190
You have to head back sooner or later.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.130
I'm not leaving.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:40.180
Woo So Ha.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:44.410
What's there to go back for?

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.840
There's no point in going back.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.840
My family...

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.680
They hardly see each other.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:04.840
They're only concerned about competition, profits, and results.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:12.180
When I'm in that home, I don't know who I am anymore.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.820
And it's not as if Dad is waiting for me to go back.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.370
He's only waiting for an obedient son to return to him.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:23.660
So Ha.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.810
You know you shouldn't take Dad's words as they are.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:29.120
Are you stupid?

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.320
You should know.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.590
Dad is actually worried about you.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:44.040
No matter how much you hate it, we're still family.

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.200
So, let's go back.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.200
So Yeong.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:03.060
Right now, I'm just Woo So Ha.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.790
I'm not going back with you.

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:10.250
I've found my reason to be here.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.450
Why don't you stay in Japan for a little longer?

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.630
You said you liked Kai, didn't you?

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.450
That's because he treats you well.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:39.050
And don't you think he's a wonderful guy
who's passionate about saving animals?

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.800
Too bad he doesn't seem ready to accept anyone into his life.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.280
That certainly seems true.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:54.120
Hey! What about you?

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.970
What are you planning to do here?

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.950
Hey!

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:08.340
Let's part ways here.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.770
Will you be alright?

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:13.000
Of course. I just need to go upstairs.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.950
Wait, Shadow.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.470
Yes?

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.030
Thank you.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:57.380
- Hello?
- Mr. Shirosaki, Sumomo is...

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.230
How are her vitals?

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:05.400
Her blood pressure remains low.
We've administered a vasopressor.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:10.490
But she still remains unresponsive.
She's not passing enough urine either.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.680
Kosuke.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.190
Don't be too sad.

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:48.420
I'm sure she's feeling scared about saying goodbye.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:56.740
We need to reassure her with an "it's okay",
and send her off knowing she's got people at her side.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.050
I wonder if Sumomo still remembers them.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.420
Who?

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:15.090
Her old family, and the discipline and kindness
they shared with her.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.730
They say most dogs do.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.750
I will relay these conditions to the other party.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:26.790
I'll let you know whether it's enough
to enter into a mediation agreement.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.300
Thank you for your help.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.650
My head's about to explode.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.890
Looks like you're doing pretty well as a lawyer.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:41.320
I woke up early today to prep the files.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.880
Thank you.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.750
You should thank Mr. Shirosaki, not me.

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:46.690
Huh?

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:54.020
When I called you last night, you said that
Mr. Shirosaki turned into a shadow and sent you home.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:59.190
I hope I didn't say anything weird to him.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.550
I'm scared to ask him about it.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.680
Monitor her breathing rate.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.060
Yes, sir.

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:11.430
Can you eat, Sumomo?

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.760
Mr. Shirosaki, Ms. Yuka is here.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.050
This is Mr. Nagakura.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:33.930
He is the son of Sumomo's former owner.
I tried my luck and contacted him, and he came down here.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:38.040
When my father passed, we couldn't take her in
as my company apartment didn't allow pets.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:43.130
Please pass this to Sumomo.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.110
Do you recognize this, Sumomo?

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:02.850
That's right. It belonged to your former owner.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:07.000
I heard they often used to sunbathe with this
on a bench in a park.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.190
Did that make you feel better?

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.290
Yummy, isn't it?

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:23.530
Yummy.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:24.930
She has a peaceful expression.

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:27.110
That's great.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.480
It's okay.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.220
It's okay, girl.

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:21.150
I wanted to thank you for yesterday,
when I heard about Sumomo.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:29.020
15 years and 4 months.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.130
She did well.

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:41.510
We know very well that they will leave us one day.
But it's still hard to accept.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:47.690
I pretend that I'm already used to it.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:01.220
But we can also think it this way.

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:09.090
They'll be waiting for us when it's our turn to bid farewell.

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:14.200
Sakura will definitely appear before me, wagging her tail.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:20.060
So I believe I'll be happy

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.810
if I follow after her.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.350
Funny.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.860
I had the very same thought.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:44.030
That's why until then, I make sure to work hard
and do whatever I can.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:53.260
So that one day, I can proudly tell them I've done my best.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:13.010
Looks like us dog-lovers think on the same wavelength.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.400
I have to send Sumomo off.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:39.710
I'll let Sakura play with Shogun for a little longer then.

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.430
Would that be okay?

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:44.840
I'll see you later.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.220
Sure.

- Especially to Kai?
- Yeah.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.580
Tell him that I'll visit him again.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:15.090
If he continues to be so clueless, I'll make him mine.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:18.140
- You're going to scare him off.
- What?

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.470
I'm sorry.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:30.970
For disappointing you.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.460
I guess you're already used to that.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.810
You're trying to change.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:46.850
You're rediscovering yourself by meeting new people,
and experiencing new things.

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:51.590
I'll explain your situation to Dad.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.070
Face those challenges head-on.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.020
Live your life that way.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.970
You're pretty charismatic, So Yeong.

Be honest with yourself.

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:29.010
How troublesome.
We haven't managed to resolve the situation at all.

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:30.630
Here you go.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:35.960
- Thank you.
- We've finally managed to establish a connection with WooRoA.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:41.020
If this goes on, the opportunity will slip right from our fingers.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.370
That would be terrible.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.490
We have to seize these opportunities.

What's going on?

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:16.370
Ms. Yuka said we're closing shop for the day.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.870
They're bidding farewell to Sumomo?

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.030
I'm really gonna feel lonely.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.970
There are so many things that I wasn't able to do for her.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:35.530
I was hoping to tell her I love her one last time.

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:39.230
Not being able to tell her that makes me feel...

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:43.270
I'm full of regrets.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.980
What do you need me to help with?

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:55.600
Our rooftop dog park is still open,
if you could help me close it.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.180
Okay.

You'll get sunburnt at this rate.

Frankly speaking, I would've returned to Seoul if I hadn't met you.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.170
I'll have to leave someday.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:30.980
So, I should tell you this.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.450
I like you.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:48.560
No, that doesn't sound right.

No, well...

What was that about?

I'm practicing how to make a confession.
