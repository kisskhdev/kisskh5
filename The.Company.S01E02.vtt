=The Company=
=Season 1=

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.244
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.140
=Episode 2=

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.380
(Yashe)

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.700
(On Duty)

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.380
(Away)

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.430
What happened?

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.580
(Yashe)

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.800
Didn't you already leave?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.660
Why are you still here?

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.120
I was looking for Xuan Wu.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.700
Wait, no... That's not the point!

00:02:20.955 --> 00:02:22.240
Why are you dressed like that?

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.560
I'm cosplaying. Don't mind me.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.750
Were we in ancient China?

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.410
No, you're seeing things.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.280
I saw everything!

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.310
That was ancient China.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.120
Why is it daytime now?

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.866
Is that an "Anywhere Door"?

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.360
I'll send you back right now.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.280
I get it.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.750
Last night wasn't a dream.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.400
We really did go to
ancient China yesterday.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.080
Who are you?

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.520
If you don't tell me, I'll...

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.710
Put that down.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.200
I'll tell you.

00:02:55.555 --> 00:02:57.750
First time anyone's ever
tried to threaten me like that.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.520
Sorry.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.590
All right. Talk.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.910
It is ancient times out there,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.120
but I'm not from the past.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.800
This isn't some "Anywhere Door."

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.310
It's a time elevator.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.750
A time elevator?

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.000
(Year 3078)

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.240
(To you,)

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.360
(I'm someone from the future.)

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.150
(The 31st century.)

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.080
(Humanity's gone through
several major technological leaps.)

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.310
(Without leaving home,)

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.870
(you can go anywhere you want)

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.840
(and get anything you want.)

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.080
(Nutrient supplements)

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.240
(have replaced meals.)

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.000
(No need to think about)

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.470
(what to eat every day.)

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.750
(All information)

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.030
(is instantly accessible.)

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.000
(AI can answer)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.310
(any question.)

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.800
(Some people embrace these changes,)

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.470
(but I just feel empty)

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.470
(and bored.)

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.870
(It even became unbearable.)

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.470
(Human connection)

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.000
(turned optional.)

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.590
(It's as if we were inside
a prison of virtual information.)

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.740
(Historical Tour of Luoyang,
Capital of Eastern Han)

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.910
(So...)

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.870
(I started studying the past.)

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.360
(Some things can only)

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.750
(be found there.)

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.800
(Back then,)

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.630
(I worked as a historic city planner.)

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.560
(During a job,)

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.270
(I discovered)

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.630
(an unregistered time elevator.)

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.040
(Time travel)

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.800
(was a major breakthrough for humanity.)

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.000
(With a time elevator,)

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.240
(you can go to any point in the past.)

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.822
(All time travel is supervised)

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.600
(by the Time Administration.)

00:05:02.644 --> 00:05:05.600
(Log in
to the Time Administration network?)

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.030
(I should've)

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.720
(reported my discovery)

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.310
(to them.)

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.800
(But all I wanted then)

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.750
(was to escape that cage of an era.)

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.440
Terribly sorry.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.320
I apologize.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.960
Make way!

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.080
Make way!

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.190
Have you seen a young man?

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.070
Not very old.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.920
Not short.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.910
He looks...

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.140
Well, he's not ugly.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.990
Have you seen him?

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.200
- No.
- No.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.950
What about you?

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.310
Anyone who knows where he is
will be generously rewarded.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.560
Let's go.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.080
Thank you.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.230
Please accept this.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.390
You don't want it?

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.600
I have no need for it.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.560
Where are you from?

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.360
Very far away.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.430
You truly value each word
as if it were gold.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.480
Well then,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.830
I suppose we've met.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:36.750
We have.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.120
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.950
So you used

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.190
this high-tech thing

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.270
to go to ancient China,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.040
and you met your good friend there.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.720
Then, you kept traveling

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.310
between different times with it.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.510
And finally,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.480
you used it

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.370
to come here.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.270
Then, why does

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.070
your spaceship...

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.720
It's a time elevator.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.800
Your time elevator.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.190
Why does it look like

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.270
an antique shop?

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.000
As a time traveler,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.560
I need an identity.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.270
Being the owner of Yashe

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.430
works for me.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.910
Every antique inside

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.910
has its own story.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.480
They've carried years of history,

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.840
unheard by anyone.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.360
And you wrote

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.960
that sign out front, too.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.240
I'm really not that friend
you're talking about.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.670
But I do

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.480
understand missing someone.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.120
I used to feel lonely all the time too.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.270
I've always wanted

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.630
a close friend.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.790
Forget it.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.080
I owe you an apology.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.080
I thought something was wrong

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.440
with your head.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.550
So what are we doing here now?

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.560
We?

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.870
Yeah.

00:09:22.955 --> 00:09:24.870
I'm already here.
I might as well take a look.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.270
It's not my first time anyway.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.960
I've got an important task to handle.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.860
I can't take you.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.120
You definitely should take me.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.150
I can help.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.480
And I'm great at keeping secrets.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.630
I won't tell anyone.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.480
Your memory hasn't fully recovered yet.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.320
If you go, it could cause trouble.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.390
I'll send you back.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.910
(I can't go unless I have my memories.)

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.660
(Lin's Tea House)

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.870
Wait.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.480
Isn't there a tea stall outside?

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.910
With a big sign that says tea?

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.920
See?

00:09:59.955 --> 00:10:01.360
Maybe I can remember something.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.000
If you take me out

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.040
to walk around

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.040
and see things,

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.030
I might remember more.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.150
(This is the era Ziyi was in,)

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.510
(but not the capital where he lived.)

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.870
(We could avoid causing trouble)

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.840
(and help him recover his memory.)

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:18.470
Fine.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.000
But you have to promise me.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.870
Time traveling isn't a game.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.510
Every action matters.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.240
No problem. Let's go!

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.240
Hold your horses.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.240
What's this?

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.150
Think of it as a changing room.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.680
A changing room?

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.840
There aren't even any clothes here.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.910
Stand on it.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.510
Put your hands on it.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.200
Remember. Don't move.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.320
Don't move.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.390
I said don't move.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.620
(Name: Su Beilu, Gender: Male)

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.460
(Yashe)

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.150
These robes are too big for me.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.630
Your outfit fits you better.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.320
I told you not to move,

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.240
and you moved anyway.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.270
Just make do.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.870
Stay with me at all times.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.440
No running off.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.390
What is it you need to do?

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.030
I'm retrieving a mirror.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.790
All right. If you need help,

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:40.630
just say the word.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.480
The shoes are big, too.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.270
You'll just have to endure it,

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.150
Dr. Su.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.080
Don't call me Dr. Su.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.870
I'm not a doctor yet.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.550
Just call me Su Beilu.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.440
My surname's Su. My given name's Beilu.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.390
Bei for north.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.320
Lu, as in land.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.630
Your etiquette's all wrong.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.270
We don't want

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.480
to draw attention.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.340
(Mutton Offal Soup)

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.550
This is amazing.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.822
(Chisha Town)
Sir, care for a drink?

00:12:18.844 --> 00:12:20.270
This is freshly brewed grape wine.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.480
I haven't got any money on me.

00:12:22.622 --> 00:12:24.320
They had grape wine in ancient times?

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.088
- I've treated you to some.
- Grape wine.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.630
Freshly brewed grape wine.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.440
I think I remember something.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.390
Miss, have a taste.
Freshly brewed grape wine.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.288
Something smells good.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.390
Like barbecue.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.600
(Grilled Meat)
Lamb skewers!

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:36.590
Grilled skewers!

00:12:36.644 --> 00:12:38.280
They had grilled skewers
back then, too?

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.510
They even had hot pot.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.510
People here play Chinese chess too.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.440
That's called Liubo Chess.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.480
I know all this feels new

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.000
and fascinating to you,

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.030
but you promised you wouldn't run off

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.440
or...

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.150
leave my sight.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.030
Su Beilu!

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.390
Horse riding is fun!

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.790
Faster!

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.750
Please accept this money as an apology.

00:13:24.844 --> 00:13:26.666
Your horse wasn't startled, was it?

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.040
Forget it.

00:13:29.244 --> 00:13:30.960
If your master weren't so reasonable,

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.120
I'd have reported you!

00:13:32.422 --> 00:13:33.670
Don't let me see you again!

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.270
Terribly sorry.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:39.720
Bizhi!

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.560
Bizhi.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.960
Untie me.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.030
It's tied so tight.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.120
I know I was wrong.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.390
It's my first time here.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.320
I was just too curious.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.044
I saw the horse
and couldn't help myself.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.320
But I won't do it again.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.630
Can you untie me, please?

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:56.750
You've got amnesia.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.030
I understand.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.910
But time travel has rules.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.360
You can't just do whatever you want.

00:14:03.911 --> 00:14:05.550
So I'm laying down three ground rules.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:06.920
First.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.030
No more conflicts with anyone,

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.270
and no causing trouble
or drawing attention.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.600
Second. Don't interfere
with other people's lives,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.270
and you don't change anyone's fate.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.240
Third.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.320
No matter what happens,

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.270
you don't leave my sight

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.000
without my permission.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.850
Is that clear?

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.960
Crystal.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.510
Say it back to me.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.350
First,

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.320
no getting into conflicts.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.030
Second, don't change
other people's lives.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.480
Third, I have to listen
to you in everything.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.510
I remember all of it.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:37.510
Pinky promise.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:41.630
Thanks.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:45.990
Bizhi!

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:47.859
Don't be mad anymore.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.030
Aren't you looking for a mirror?

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.890
I'll help you find it.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.320
The general's back!

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.000
The general has returned!

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:54.150
Come look!

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.270
The general's back!

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.630
General Li has returned!

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.360
It's General Li!

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:01.960
Let me see!

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.340
(Li Yansheng,
General of Valiant Cavalry)

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.750
General Li is incredible!

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.390
What a man!

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.270
This just got complicated.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.390
What do you mean?

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.320
The thing I need is on his armor.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.550
I remember something round on his chest.

00:15:47.577 --> 00:15:49.044
That's the Fish-patterned Mirror.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.270
Isn't that his chest mirror?

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.533
It's part of his armor.
It's his equipment.

00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:55.240
It's their version
of a bulletproof vest.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.140
It's there to save his life.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.444
How could he give that to you?

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.320
Must you take it?

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.440
I must.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.870
But...

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.030
They're already gone.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.200
Let's split up and gather some intel.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.720
Here.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.960
Thanks.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.000
General Li is known

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.390
as General Windrider.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.200
(When the men stop, the horses don't.)

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:19.570
- Move out!
- Yes, sir!

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.355
(Cavalry)
Do you know

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.310
why the Windrider Battalion is so fast?

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:25.870
Each soldier

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.120
has two horses
and switches between them.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.870
(So the horses don't need
as much rest.)

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.150
On this expedition,

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.240
they encountered the enemy.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.630
But General Li

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.630
outsmarted them.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.200
General, there's no one there.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.240
No one?

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.480
Instead, General Li surrounded them.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.630
(And most importantly,)

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.150
he is the general of the Windriders.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.610
You can't catch him even if you try.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.800
Su Beilu.

00:17:05.133 --> 00:17:08.440
The locals say there's a victory banquet
for the Windrider Battalion tonight.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.750
We'll use that chance to try

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.110
to get an audience with him.

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:13.430
Let's go.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.960
- Great!
- Great!

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.510
- Great!
- Great!

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.480
- Great!
- Great!

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:26.910
Mr. Yang.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.400
Word is that General Li
secured another victory.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.790
Congratulations are in order.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.640
We're here to celebrate his victory.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.640
I've long admired
General Li's reputation.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.640
I brought a few jars of fine liquor

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.400
to present to him.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:41.830
General Li's orders are

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:42.880
to leave them here.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.111
- We were hoping to...
- Much appreciated.

00:17:45.133 --> 00:17:46.260
(Chen Wu, Lieutenant General)

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.030
Please be seated.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.510
And you are?

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.640
I've long admired General Li.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.590
He returned victorious
with a resounding triumph.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.955
We prepared a small gift
and hoped to present it personally.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.800
No need.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.310
Leave it here.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.150
All right.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.830
Leave it here.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.400
So stingy.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.360
He won't even meet us
while we're offering gifts.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.960
General Li's notoriously direct

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.510
and never cared for social niceties.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.000
Every time he wins,
he celebrates only with his soldiers.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.590
It's already fortunate we got in.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.480
- Great!
- Great!

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.030
Finally get to try authentic
ancient Chinese food.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.160
- Where are you going?
- I'm bringing liquor to the general.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.070
You can't go up there.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.160
Don't you know the rules?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.160
A toast to you, General Li.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.840
We'll find

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.510
a chance

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.750
to drink with him, too.

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.400
But he's leaving.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:03.670
Great!

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.390
Follow him.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.920
Is he admiring himself in the mirror?

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.110
Even a general can be that into himself?

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.080
Right.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.240
Look.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.720
They're celebrating.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.070
Our men fought hard this time.

00:19:29.111 --> 00:19:30.680
Never thought it'd go so well this time.

00:19:30.688 --> 00:19:32.750
I think he's talking to the mirror.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.510
Yao, it's too noisy here.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.640
I couldn't hear clearly.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.777
What did you say to remember?

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.760
Behind you!

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.150
General!

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.480
Are you all right?

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.790
Take this spy away.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.150
Yes, sir. Take him away!

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.960
Thank you both for what you just did.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:17.670
Thank you.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:27.830
Did you obtain this mirror

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.240
by chance on the Huaishui Battlefield?

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.110
Yes.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.440
I must be frank.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
This mirror belonged

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.270
to a friend of mine.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.110
No matter the circumstances,

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.920
I must ask that you return it to me.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.590
This mirror is extremely important

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.160
to me.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.400
It once saved my life.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.110
Please return it.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.520
General,

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.440
the spy has confessed.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.680
Maybe you should reconsider?

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.422
- We came all this way...
- Say no more.

00:21:23.622 --> 00:21:24.844
There has been a situation.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.270
I must take my leave.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.950
Farewell.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.070
I swear I heard

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.920
a woman's voice coming from the mirror.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.640
So what do we do now?

00:21:43.088 --> 00:21:45.000
Didn't you say you like riding horses?

00:21:45.955 --> 00:21:47.510
Then let's ride to our heart's content.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.880
(General, we learned from interrogating
the assassin last night)

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.533
(that the enemy plans
to attack Mo City.)

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.030
(Qingshan Garments)
(We'll assemble the troops overnight)

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.600
(and set out to intercept them.)

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.888
Wang De! Wang Ling!

00:22:05.888 --> 00:22:06.640
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.311
Lead a squad of Windriders
alongside me.

00:22:08.311 --> 00:22:09.888
We'll scout their movements.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:10.840
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.950
- Chen Wu.
- Yes, sir.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.750
You lead the main force
down the central route

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.200
and head for Mo City at full speed.

00:22:15.222 --> 00:22:16.440
Sir, let me be the advance...

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.280
That's an order.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.590
Sir...

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.550
I know what you're going to say.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.110
I trust you with the troops.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.720
Besides, you've got elders to care for
and kids to raise.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.640
Leave this to me.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.240
General,

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:30.640
take care.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:33.079
Move out!

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.111
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.430
Bizhi! Bizhi, wait!

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:41.670
Stop!

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.240
This is worse than carsickness...

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.350
Is this horse sickness?

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.910
Here.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.000
Eat this.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.510
I think I ate too much breakfast.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.160
It's so sour.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.680
Feel better now?

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.440
Yeah, a lot better.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:18.640
Wait here.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.920
No way.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.350
I said I'd help you.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.200
I've been mooching
off you this whole trip.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.550
I can't just leave you on your own.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.030
You should think this through.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.200
We won't be riding horses
beyond this point.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.510
That's great.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.310
I'll be fine as long as no horses
are involved.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.150
Come on!

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:49.590
Are we there yet?

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.030
Let's stop here.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.110
Great.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.030
I can't walk anymore.

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.910
So why are

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.350
we here anyway?

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.440
Waiting for General Li.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.240
You still haven't given up?

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.170
Didn't he make it clear
he won't give it to you?

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:08.640
Pushing it more wouldn't be good.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.920
And how do you even know he'll come?

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.310
He's going to fight a battle here today.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.110
This is the highest ground.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.590
From here, you can see
the entire battlefield.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.550
I see.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.620
You're from the future.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.830
That makes you some kind of prophet

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.510
to the people in the past.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.480
Can you tell me

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.440
if I'll pass
the veterinary licensing exam?

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.070
I'm not a fortune teller.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.240
And besides, if you really are Ziyi,

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.440
you wouldn't need
to take any exams anymore.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.480
True.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.070
Still, that ability
of yours can be handy.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.440
If I had it,

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.200
life would be a lot easier.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.240
So what about this battle?

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.000
Does General Li win or lose?

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.480
He'll die here.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.070
We're just going to let him die?

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.510
Victory and defeat are part of war.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:10.510
For those who live on the battlefield,

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.350
life and death were set aside long ago.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:14.880
Winning the battle is what matters.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:18.480
He's here.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.640
We have to save them!

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:27.790
We can't save him.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.880
Fixed points in time can't be changed.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.030
That's a rule of time travel.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.040
And...

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:37.590
when you came here...

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.110
Stop!

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:51.830
General Li, please stop!

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:52.880
You can't go any farther!

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.160
There's danger ahead!

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.030
You again!

00:25:59.030 --> 00:25:59.960
General Li,

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.000
if you

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.240
keep going, you'll die!

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.080
How dare you!

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.520
Wait.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.160
You're a strange one.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:08.480
You don't really seem

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.560
like a spy.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:10.870
Talk.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.550
What exactly are you after?

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.000
I'm just trying to warn you.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.070
The people in the city adore you.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:17.200
You're a good man.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.720
I don't want you to die in vain.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.160
Nonsense.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:21.880
I'm in the army.

00:26:21.888 --> 00:26:23.577
My life and death are decided by fate.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.640
Even if I were to die,

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.880
why should I fear it?

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.480
That may be true,

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.550
but you're still so young.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.200
You should die for a worthy cause.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Untie me!

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.270
Don't go!

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:39.720
Stop!

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.270
Is anyone there?

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.040
Help! Please help me!

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.270
It's tied so tight.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.200
Didn't you promise

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.270
you wouldn't

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.310
act on your own?

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.070
Didn't I just tell you

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.920
events in history can't be changed?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.377
What do you think you're doing?

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.550
Shouldn't we at least try?

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.350
You can try by yourself.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:09.510
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.400
Please untie me.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.400
It's really cutting in.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.000
I'm sorry. I really am.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.030
Please help me!

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.200
Report!

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.510
Report!

00:27:28.111 --> 00:27:29.577
Enemy forces spotted 1.5 km ahead.

00:27:29.577 --> 00:27:30.750
One unit is heading toward Mo City.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.640
Another is moving southeast.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.350
Southeast? That's Chen Wu's route.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:34.822
General, Mo City has no defenses.

00:27:34.822 --> 00:27:37.240
If the enemy reaches it first,
the consequences will be disastrous.

00:27:37.244 --> 00:27:39.160
General, we only have one unit.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.066
(We have to split our forces
no matter what.)

00:27:41.066 --> 00:27:43.311
(I'll draw away the enemy
going after Chen Wu.)

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:44.910
- Wang De.
- Yes, sir.

00:27:44.911 --> 00:27:46.480
Do you remember the route to Mo City?

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.320
Of course.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:48.630
Good.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.830
Then I'm entrusting these men to you.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:51.870
What about you?

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:53.000
I have my own plan.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.160
Men!

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.350
I hereby order you,

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.160
even if it costs your lives,
to hold Mo City

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.550
until Chen Wu arrives.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:01.590
That's an order!

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:02.590
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.790
Report!

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.400
Enemy troops ahead.
It's Li Yansheng's unit.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:18.590
Could it be...

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:20.750
Excellent.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:21.590
After them!

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.920
Capture Li Yansheng

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.480
and you'll be richly rewarded!

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.080
Li Yansheng,

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.400
we meet again.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.680
That's...

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.750
General Li.

00:29:07.955 --> 00:29:09.720
I thought they were the main force.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.960
How dare they trick us!

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.240
Seize him!

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.240
The outcome's already decided.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.350
Nothing you do will change it.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.000
Don't put yourself in danger.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.200
Come at me!

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.440
The Windrider Battalion

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.550
would rather die than surrender!

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.660
(Mo City)

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.000
(Chen Wu,)

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.590
(the fate of Mo City)

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.350
(is in your hands.)

00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:01.340
(Mo City)

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.960
Did I do something wrong?

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:28.510
Is that why I couldn't save Li Yansheng?

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:32.680
No matter what you said or did,

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.830
Li Yansheng was destined

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.790
to die in this battle.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.440
I won't be getting
the Fish-patterned Mirror back.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.110
I'll go down and look with you.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.880
The water below the cliff is raging.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:46.750
Finding the mirror

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.880
is impossible.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.750
Li Yansheng was meant
to die on the mountain road.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.750
But because you interfered,

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.160
you affected their march.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.030
You didn't change his fate,

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.070
but you changed where he died.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:01.550
I'm sorry.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:25.100
(Yashe)

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:36.300
(Days Pass and Months Go By)

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:37.830
I'm changed.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.640
Did you remember anything?

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.830
Remember what?

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:44.240
Your memories.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.880
So much has happened
these past few days.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.070
I need time to process it.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.590
I'm going back to rest.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:57.720
You should turn in early too.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.310
It's already the morning
of our second day back.

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.680
It's 8 :00 AM?

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.750
I need to go to work.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.760
Do you

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:12.960
still have a chance

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.440
to recover the Fish-patterned Mirror?

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:16.880
We'll wait.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:19.070
In the vast flow of time,

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:20.720
it'll turn up eventually.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.440
I'm sure you'll get it back soon.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:25.670
Good luck!

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:30.750
Good luck.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:38.870
Wait!

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.560
I remember something.

00:33:42.777 --> 00:33:43.755
Do you remember

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.750
that on the day Li Yansheng
was assassinated,

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.822
there was a woman
speaking from inside the mirror?

00:33:47.844 --> 00:33:49.030
Can we find her?

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.140
(Days Pass and Months Go By)

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.820
(Year 2018)

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.540
(Nanyu City)

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.960
(Madam, you need to be prepared.)

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.480
(Her condition has
worsened significantly.)

00:34:49.688 --> 00:34:51.760
(I'm sorry, Mom.)
(The treatment isn't working.)

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:53.360
(She may)

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.400
(never stand again.)

00:35:05.416 --> 00:35:07.256
Who are you?

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.670
Why are you crying here?

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:44.960
You actually found that girl's address.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.320
Where does she live again?

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:48.670
Building 3, unit 502.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.030
Is it okay for you

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:52.710
to skip work

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:53.670
and come with me?

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.230
Don't worry. I saved up a ton of leave.

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.190
Might as well use it.

00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.070
Come take a look!

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.422
Something's happened up ahead!

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.280
What's going on?

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:09.710
Go back inside!

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.280
Go inside!

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.840
Don't jump!

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.230
Don't jump!

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:16.670
It's dangerous!

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.070
Go back!

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.590
No way...

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.070
One, two, three, four, five.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.150
It's on the fifth floor.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.422
This isn't good.
Isn't that His daughter?

00:36:26.422 --> 00:36:27.840
- Yes.
- She's been sick for so long.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.220
She wouldn't be thinking
of jumping, would she?

00:36:29.222 --> 00:36:31.400
It's dangerous for her
to be out there. Call 110!

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.760
You're inside the bronze mirror.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.510
Are you a ghost?

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.670
Am I hallucinating?

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:41.880
You.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.510
How did you die?

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:46.910
I...

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.840
I'm not dead.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.880
I just don't want to be
a burden on my mom anymore.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:58.320
You mean

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.070
you want to end your own life?

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.070
Are you dead too?

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.670
Are...

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:08.800
Are you a ghost?

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.480
I can't die!

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.480
The frontier isn't secured.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.400
My ambitions are unfinished.

00:37:16.777 --> 00:37:19.066
(Huaishui Battlefield)
My reinforcements will arrive soon.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.230
Stay and talk with me.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.150
I can't die.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.030
I have to live.

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.440
Dying isn't so bad.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.440
It ends everything.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.640
Silence!

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.240
Coward.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.400
You've never been on a battlefield.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.550
You don't understand

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.510
how precious it is to stay alive.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.800
Only by living

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:48.110
is there hope.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.880
Once you're dead...

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:52.760
Once you're dead, there's nothing left.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.630
Yao!

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.200
Yao!

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:00.800
What are you doing out there?

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.640
Yao!

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:03.030
Get back inside!

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.840
Don't do it, Yao!

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.710
I'll be right there!

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:08.110
Please don't do it!

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:08.950
Yao!

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.880
- Come on!
- I'm coming!

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.920
Get inside!

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:24.550
If I die...

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.800
If I die, there'll be nothing left...

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.670
Without me,

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.030
my mom has nothing...

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.920
Be careful!

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.440
Hang on!

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:15.480
Hurry, ma'am!

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.840
The key!

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:27.510
Hold on!

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:28.840
Hold on!

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:30.960
Don't give up!

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.840
Help!

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:36.710
Help!

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.030
Help!

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:42.400
Just... just a little more!

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:47.800
- Hold on!
- Yao!

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.990
Yao!

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.200
Yao!

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.600
Yao!

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.150
Help!

00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.400
Hold on!

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.840
Help!

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:19.670
They got her.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.760
Thank you...

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.280
Thank you so much...

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.440
It was He's daughter.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.360
That was a close call.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.110
- Thanks to that guy.
- Yes.

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:00.230
The one upstairs in black.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:01.822
- Yes.
- Dropped right from the sky.

00:41:01.822 --> 00:41:02.430
Yes.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.360
They're singing your praises.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.760
You broke our deal again.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.190
You saved her, too.

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:09.630
I did it to save you.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.400
Well, it was an emergency.
I mean, look at the poor thing.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.533
She can't even move her legs.

00:41:13.533 --> 00:41:14.440
What if she snapped

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.840
and actually jumped? Then what?

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.590
We're here for
the Fish-patterned Mirror.

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:21.030
Oh, right.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.600
Where's the mirror?

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.030
It was in her room.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:28.320
So why didn't you grab it?

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:32.550
Yes, why didn't I?

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.510
Were we supposed to steal or rob?

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.000
We've got the Yashe anyway.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.155
There's always next time.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:48.110
Get some sleep.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.760
Mom.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.030
Can you

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.400
sleep with me tonight?

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:11.840
Of course.

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:34.350
Mom...

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:41.550
I'm sorry...

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.150
Yao,

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:08.280
it's time to get up.
