WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.400
Once I was sure Pong was one of them,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.920
I told the cops to tail you.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.040
And they caught him red-handed.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.440
Sara and I… We're getting married.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.600
Now you're using money
to make my sister marry you?

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.520
What will come next?

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.160
So, how about this?

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.920
Let time be the proof

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.440
that I didn't force Sara.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.960
I really need to talk to you.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.080
Can you come to my condo?

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.240
Eyes! Eyes!

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.960
You used the advance
to help your ex pay her debts?

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.720
Are you out of your mind?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.760
Mr. Chakrit caught that

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.960
Mr. Pathawee used company funds
for personal matters.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.160
So, he must take responsibility
by resigning from his position.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.960
Isn't that right, Mr. Pathawee?

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.240
Uncle Perm.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.280
Now I hate my claustrophobia the most.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.160
I couln't even use the elevator!

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.200
The documents in everyone's hands

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.240
are proof that every single baht
has been returned to the company.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.280
The total matches exactly with
the evidence Mr. Chakrit showed earlier.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.760
If you look at the date and time,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.200
Mr. Chakrit's document came out first.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.560
As for Mr. Pathawee's,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.000
it was issued just this morning.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.520
I had an urgent personal matter
and needed the money quickly,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.440
but I returned it

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.680
within a very short time.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.600
I understand it was inappropriate.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.360
I sincerely apologize
to everyone once again.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.440
Using company money
for personal matters is wrong,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.160
even if you've already paid it back!

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.240
Everyone,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.000
don't let him off the hook.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.360
Someone like this deserves to be removed!

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.200
This company doesn't belong
to you alone, Mr. Chakrit.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.080
Whether Mr. Pathawee stays or goes,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.040
let everyone decide together.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.520
Stay out of this!

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.880
Alright then.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.480
Please don't side with me

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.080
just because
of our friendship or familiarity.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.680
I take full responsibility for what I did.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.800
Let's put it to a vote.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.720
If anyone believes
I'm no longer fit for this position,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.640
please raise your hand.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.880
Mr. Din.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.040
How are you? You doing okay?

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.120
News travels fast. Worried about me?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.080
Well…

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.720
Good thing you still have some merit left.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.080
You're Suthee's daughter?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.400
Hello, Auntie.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.520
Haven't seen you in years. You look
just like your mother when she was young.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.920
I'll be heading off now.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.520
Yes, ma'am.
I'll have someone get the car ready.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.680
You know someone's eyeing your position.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.480
Be more careful with what you do.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.080
Right.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.400
So weak in the knees already?

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.600
My knees hurt.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.080
I ran up the stairs
because I'm claustrophobic.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.520
That's a lot of floors, you know.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.960
Didn't know you were impatient.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.000
Why are you smiling?

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.440
Thank you

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.880
for worrying about me.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.040
I only worried because
I was the one who gave you the advice.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.000
If you'd been removed from your position,

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.640
I'd feel guilty for the rest of my life.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.040
Hey, hey.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.640
Mr. Din! What are you doing?

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.760
Stay still.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.880
Well…

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.240
You said your legs hurt.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.440
So, I'm massaging them for you.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.000
No need.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.720
I can do it myself. Someone might see us.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.680
-Stop it.
-That's even better.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.560
They'll see how well I take care of you.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.720
-Here, right?
-Yes.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.680
So tell me,

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.440
whose money did you borrow
to pay the company back?

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.320
Hey!

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.320
It's a calf strain, not a cramp! It hurts!

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.800
2,000,000.00 RECEIVED
REMAINING BALANCE: 2,356,589.00

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.240
Why pay it back so soon?

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.840
I told you, it's idle money.
I wasn't going to use it anyway.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.760
You're already making me
feel guilty enough.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.080
You warned me and even lent me money.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.120
Hello, Baicha. What's up?

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.080
Have you gotten home yet, Din?

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.120
Not yet. I'm on my way. What's wrong?

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.440
Can you stop by my café for a bit?

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.240
By the time I get there, it'll be closed.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.720
Good.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.160
Because I have something really important

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.440
I want to talk to you about.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.200
Alright then, I'll come right away.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.280
So, what will you do next, Din?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.360
I don't know yet.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.120
Two million isn't a small amount.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.680
And the deadline's coming up fast.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.920
If it were just a few days,
I could borrow from friends.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.160
Then, you could use my money
to tide things over for now.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.080
I can't do that.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.680
It's not a small sum.
I'm already grateful that you warned me.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.400
Trust me, Din.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.600
Put the money
into the company account first.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.280
Then wait
until the shareholders' meeting is over.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.480
It might not fix everything,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.680
but it should help a little.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.800
If it weren't for you,
I'd be in real trouble.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.080
I feel bad too,
having to betray Krit like that.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.120
But I couldn't just stand by and watch
you suffer because of my brother.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.360
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.840
No, I should be the one
apologizing for Krit,

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.720
for always stirring things up.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.080
I just don't understand

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.280
how long he'll hold this grudge,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.920
when it all started with our parents.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.560
Anyway, I really have to thank you
for helping me.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.200
If not for you,
I would've lost my position.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.800
Is that it?

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.480
Why is it that

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.200
for someone
who caused you trouble, like Eyes,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.000
or someone you just met, like Ms. Sarah,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.560
you'd go as far as marrying her,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.480
but you never cared for me?

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.520
It's not that I don't care for you.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.760
But I see you like a little sister.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.120
I really can't think of you any other way.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.240
Even though I'm grown up?

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.320
No matter

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.200
how good I am to you?

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.480
I'm sorry.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.480
Din.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.360
If Nam says he won't give up on Ms. Sarah,

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.600
then I won't give up on you either.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.400
Where were you praying
to get out of that alive?

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.640
Company accounting

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.000
is internal.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.520
It's odd that Chakrit knew

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.400
and even had the transfer records.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.800
Well…

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.120
I was the one who told him.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.160
Nam!

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.480
Is that what you wanted to hear?

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.920
You want me to be the bad guy?

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.080
I'll be the bad guy.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.720
Happy now, Din?

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.560
You think you could stoop to dirty tricks
to make Ms. Sarah marry you,

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.280
so you assume
I'd use dirty tactics like you?

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.360
I would never do something I despise.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.440
I'll beat you the right way.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.960
And I'll make Ms. Sarah see my worth.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.080
Sorry for the trouble I caused, Din.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.160
It's all right.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.600
It's over now, and I pulled through.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.720
I promise
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.640
Just do what you can.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.080
Don't pressure yourself.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.400
I once lost you, Din.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.000
I don't want money
to make me lose you again.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.040
Nam told me you had to marry Ms. Sarah

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.360
because of company problems.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.680
Is that true?

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.240
Do you think it's true?

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.520
From what I know of you, I believe it is.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.440
When you set your mind on something,
you always see it through,

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.080
even if it costs you,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.520
even if it hurts so bad.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.640
So, why couldn't you
force yourself to do this too?

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.000
Honestly, I'm not being forced that much.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.640
I've known Sara since we were kids,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.520
even before I met you.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.880
She's kind,

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.240
strong,

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.680
and family-oriented.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.520
I don't think

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.320
I made the wrong choice.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.960
You praise her so much,

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.360
now I kind of want
to meet this woman myself.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.000
BOONYAVEJ HOSPITAL

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.520
Who's gossiping about me now?

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:09.079
You've been gossiped about nonstop.
I've seen you sneeze a few times.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.200
Is it gossip or just allergies?

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.079
The weather's been changing lately.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.880
-Mr. Din.
-Hello.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.400
I brought meals for everyone.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.920
Thanks so much.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.680
I'll head to class.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.200
Aren't you going to eat first?

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.760
-Mr. Din even brought food.
-No, thanks.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.160
Sorry about him.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.400
Don't worry, I understand.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.400
So, shall we eat together then?

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.680
Sure.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.840
I'll help.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.800
BOONYAVEJ HOSPITAL

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.560
Hello. Please pick me up
in front of the hospital.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.080
-Thanks so much.
-Alright.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.560
Go sit and eat with Mr. Din.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.440
I can eat right here.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.480
Okay.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.280
Hey.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.200
Is this Sarach's?

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.560
Yes. He was so upset,
he forgot to grab it all.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.280
Call him right now and tell him.
You might still catch him.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.440
Okay.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.280
BOONYAVEJ HOSPITAL

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.600
He doesn't pick up?

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.520
He probably rode off on the motorbike.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.480
Should we bring it to the campus then?

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.240
-It's nearby.
-But…

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.760
You still haven't eaten.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.880
It's okay.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.200
We'll be back soon.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.960
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.000
What's up? If you're calling
to complain about Din, I'm hanging up.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.840
Oh, right.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.000
I forgot.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.400
Meet me at the back gate then.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.720
You can circle around.
Traffic's bad at the front gate.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.080
What did Sarach say?

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.600
He said to meet behind the campus

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.000
because the front gate's clogged.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.600
I'll check the map for you.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.080
Pong?

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.920
You called the cops on me, didn't you?

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.640
Hey. Beat him up.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.400
Sarach!

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:27.960
Mr. Din!

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.520
Help! Help!

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.680
Mr. Din…

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.840
Hey! Who the hell?!

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:38.960
Let me go!

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.240
Mr. Din! Mr. Din.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.760
Help! Help! Someone please help!

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.680
Help! Mr. Din!

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.600
-Are you a relative of the patient?
-Yes.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.880
How is he doing?

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.800
He asked for you.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.640
But don't worry.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.800
The doctors are doing their best.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.720
Din! Din!

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.120
Well…

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.360
He seems fine.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.080
Who told you I was going to die?

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.000
The patient's safe.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.280
It was a glancing stab, not deep.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.800
No vital organs were hit.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.040
Get the meds, and you can go home.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.360
Thank you so much, Doctor.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.600
The nurse said you asked to see me.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.000
I thought you were in a coma,
about to say your last words.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.240
You should write novels, honestly.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.440
So, why did you want me here?

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.400
My clothes were torn, and there was blood.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.480
I just wanted you
to grab a shirt from my car.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.200
You could've told the nurse.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.400
What?

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.360
It's all in your head,
and now you blame everyone.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.560
What's with you?

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.480
Making that face,
aren't you glad I'm okay?

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.240
Of course I am.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.440
So glad I could stab you myself
with my own hands.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.320
How violent.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.760
If it had been a bit lower,
you'd have ended up with a trans buddy.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:17.880
What?

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.440
You… You pervert. That's disgusting!

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.120
Lower your voice.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.440
This is a hospital.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.240
Still, thank you.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.400
For what?

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.200
For calling me just "Din."

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.960
I'd like to hear it again.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.320
Din. Din…

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.200
Din…

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.360
Call me again, please.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.680
What? You just called me that.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.640
-What's wrong with saying it again? Din…
-Ugh.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.360
The closer the gift set launch gets,
the more stressed I become.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.160
If it's launch day, I won't sleep.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.640
I think I'm a workaholic.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.520
But you're worse than me.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.800
So, you owe me a big raise.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.040
Are you okay? Does the wound hurt?

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.160
Yeah, it stings sometimes,
but it's nothing serious.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.240
I think you should go get some rest.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.360
Look at you.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.000
You're hurt and still talking so much.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.320
If that wound rips open
from your babbling, I'll make it worse.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.520
Why are you smiling?

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.400
Did getting stabbed in the stomach
rattle your brain?

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.640
I'm smiling because
you're fussing over me.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.040
Even when I say I'm fine,
you still held on to me all the way here.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.120
Well, you're hurt because

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.880
you helped my brother,

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.000
so I have to look after you.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.200
It's nothing really.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.800
I wasn't complaining.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.880
If we're not in front of others,
there's no need to put on a show.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.200
I'm taking care of Mr. Din

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.320
because he helped my brother.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.360
I heard about it from Yo.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.520
Din's not hurt that much.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.080
Or is he just pulling
another trick to fool you?

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.800
That's your brother, you know.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.360
I don't think you should be talking

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.360
about your own brother like that.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.960
Are you defending him?

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.400
You forgot…

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.400
Forgot what?

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.000
You could've just called me.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.600
I would've come to you.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.240
You were just being helped
walking a moment ago.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.240
How are you walking in so casually now?

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.040
I told you,

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.200
you can't beat my brother's game.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.480
Whether it's true or not, I don't care.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.560
But the fact that he got hurt
because of my brother, that's real.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.920
And that's enough for me.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.280
Is his money really enough
to buy you off this much?

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.120
Don't talk to Sara like that.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.280
You should work in my office instead.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.600
That way, you won't have to get upset
over losers like this.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.480
Let's go.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.240
You insult me and walk away?

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.040
Mr. Nam!

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.760
Mr. Din!

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.440
Din…

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.960
Hey, stop! Stop.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.120
I told you to stop!

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.200
I said stop!

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.600
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.800
Are you hurt?

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.520
You two are executives here.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.480
Pull yourselves together.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.000
If you use your fists
instead of your heads,

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.440
there's nothing left to discuss.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.320
You still haven't forgiven me?

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.640
I'm sorry.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.400
The one who should apologize…

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.960
is actually me.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.920
Because I was in trouble with money

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.560
and had to bother you,

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.640
and it even led to you
fighting your own brother.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.160
Honestly,

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.760
I feel awful about it.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.120
Don't blame yourself.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.560
Nam and I dragged you into this mess.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.120
This has nothing to do with you.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.320
But still,

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.120
I can't help feeling upset.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.640
Ms. Eyes?

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.680
Is there something you need from me?

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.000
I already know everything
about you and Din, and about Nam too.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.800
Who will you choose?

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.880
Between Din and Nam?

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.760
If I get to choose,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.800
I'd choose not to answer that.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.560
Okay, then I'll change the question.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.760
Between Din and Nam, who do you like more?

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.240
Why would you show this to me?

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.400
Don't tell me this is a photo of you.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.000
Yes. It's me when I was a child.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.280
Before the accident.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.440
Before I had surgery.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.240
Stir-fried morning glory.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.200
Heat the pan. When it's hot,

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.200
pour in the oil like this.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.320
Then add the morning glory.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.480
Finish up and plate it like this.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.400
-You can try.
-Okay.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.240
THREE MONTHS LATER

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.720
Mr. Din.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.360
What?

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.120
Didn't you ask me

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.360
who I liked better?

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.640
If you knew what's happening now,

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.560
you'd know I used to live
at Phimarndech house when I was a kid.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.040
Back then,

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.960
the only person who ever saw me
for who I really was…

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.320
was Mr. Din.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.120
The reason I didn't answer

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.840
when you asked who I'd choose

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.960
is because I wasn't the one

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.120
making that choice.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.199
You're not just beautiful,
you're smart too, aren't you?

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.840
If no one knew
you'd had plastic surgery before,

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.920
I could've used that to expose you
and score points with Din.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.679
Too bad that trick won't work now.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:33.440
If it had worked,
it would've been good for everyone.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.840
No, it wouldn't.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.159
Because Din has feelings for you too.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.640
Thanks for being willing to talk.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.040
I think you still have a choice.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.720
What do you mean?

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.680
Well, you and Din aren't married yet.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.400
You still have time to rethink this.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.760
It might already be too late.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.480
But I still want you to reconsider.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.560
Because I want to get back with Din,

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.720
but I can't, not while you're here.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.040
If you're hesitating about marrying him,

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.280
it means you don't love him.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.840
Not the way I do.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.240
Then please give Din back to me.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.240
I want to take care of him.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.040
I want to repay the kindness he showed me.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.640
You're a woman too.
You should understand how I feel.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.320
Wait.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.040
What happened to your face?

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.200
Oh, it's nothing much.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.280
Nam's face has bruises too.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.800
You two have been fighting, haven't you?

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.360
Yes.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.040
Was it because of Suthee's daughter?

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.520
He's crazy about her.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.640
Even after announcing the wedding,
it's still chaos.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.320
You've got to do something about it.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.480
There's probably only one way left.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.640
-When will you deal with this?
-Next week.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.760
What were you talking about?

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.440
What's happening next week?

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.680
Just seeing their faces drives me crazy.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.120
Now I have to live
under the same roof as them.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.040
What are you doing? I'm not playing.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.960
Do you really think
just a pillow and a blanket

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.440
will actually keep me away?

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.760
Mr. Din, we have a big issue.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.680
If I ask for a seat on the board,

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.520
what will you say, Din?

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.360
Who do you want on the board?

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.480
Tonight…
I'll make you forget all about it.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:10.920
