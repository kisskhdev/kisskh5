"Doctor's Mine" (Episode 1)

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.620
I was minding my own business,
what's your problem?

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.340
You're the one looking for trouble.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.930
Hey, bro!

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.490
Come on then!

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.540
Hold on!

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.010
If you really want it, come on then!

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.980
Stop!

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.210
Stop it!

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160
Just stop!

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.950
Just stop!

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.320
Why are you getting involved, Mild?!

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.750
You're the one who needs to stop.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.920
Please take him away to calm down.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.710
If he stays here, they're
definitely going to fight again.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.420
I'll take care of his wound first.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.470
Hey, I'm not going! Why are you
treating his wound? I'm your brother!

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.160
Hey, hey,

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.990
what the hell?!

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.320
Are you okay?

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.410
I'm fine.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.770
Come here, I'll treat your wound.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.870
No need.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.940
You're acting cool, or do
you want another round?

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.250
Fighting doesn't get
anything, it just hurts.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.160
Next time, don't get involved
with Mud again, okay?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.040
You're hurt,

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.540
You got hit squarely by the belt buckle.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.770
Just a little bit.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.900
Hey, No need, I can do it myself.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.780
What's wrong with him?

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.610
So you think that Knight is
better than your own brother?

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.200
I know you can take care of yourself.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.240
Hey!

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.590
You're a doctor - can you
even choose your patients?

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.810
Didn't you say all patients are important?

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.186
Didn't you say all patients are important?
And I'm your brother, you know!

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.590
Well, you're my brother, not a patient.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.660
Ah, you...

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.440
Then why did you suddenly punch him?

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.870
That damn guy troubled me.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.810
He said that I stole his
girlfriend in high school.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.850
Is it real?

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.910
Yeah, but I'm your older brother!

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.240
I know you're my brother,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.680
but aren't you and P'Knight are friends?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.510
I stopped being friends with him.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.460
You don't need to get
involved with him anymore.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.590
So, should I believe you?

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.070
It's up to you.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.860
If you don't want to
believe me, then don't.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.271
But you absolutely shouldn't
get involved with him again.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.430
Knight is a bad person,
he's promiscuous with both guys and girls.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.620
Don't get involved with him, understand?

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.540
Don't get involved with him, understand?

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.540
What the heck?

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.590
Hey Mild,

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.936
what were you doing at the
Faculty of Engineering yesterday?

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.310
Yeah, what were you doing there?

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.446
I was just going to see P'Mud
at the Faculty of Engineering.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.000
Oh, is that all?

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.130
Look at this then.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.360
You're definitely screwed.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:07.840
Why?

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.620
Oh, you just punched Knight, the 4th-year
engineering head, and knocked him out!

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.240
He's the University Star.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.510
Yeah, you knocked him out yourself,

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.260
and then you went to bandage him up, right?

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.600
Well, because I punched him,

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.700
I have to take responsibility.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.200
You're definitely going to
face Knight's fan club soon.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.910
What am I going to face?

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.980
If you don't believe me, then ask Klah.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.310
You better be careful.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.910
What's the big deal?

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.270
Oh well, I don't have any reason
to step foot in engineering anyway.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.310
Yes.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.970
- I'll wait and see.
- Go to class.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.750
Alright, let's go.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:44.790
Hey!

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.090
- Oh no.
- Why?

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.590
I swapped bags with P'Mud.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.910
Oh,

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.010
good luck, my friend.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.070
Hope I see you in the gross anatomy
lab as a living person, my friend.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.100
Tum!

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.020
Alright, I'll be right back.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.310
Yeah yeah, good luck!

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.830
Do you think he'll survive?

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.490
I don't know.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.920
Tum and Klah are really exaggerating!

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.450
I came to the Faculty of Engineering
and haven't had anything happen to me.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.590
Hey Nong Mild,

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.410
Mud's brother, right?

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.560
Do you guys need something?

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.640
I have to hurry to class.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.190
What's your relationship with Knight?

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.990
Are you Knight's friend?

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.510
Answer me.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.740
Iâ€¦I

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.846
Oh, you just punched Knight, the 4th-year
engineering head, and knocked him out!

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.360
He's the University Star.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.990
Yeah, you knocked him out yourself,
and then you went to patch him up, right?

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.000
Well, because I punched him,

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.050
I have to take responsibility.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.550
You're definitely going to
face Knight's fan club soon.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.090
What am I going to face?

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.830
You'd better watch out.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:37.320
What's the big deal?

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.360
I'm Knight's wife.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.670
Knight loves me very, very much.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.490
Don't come near me!

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.410
My beloved wife?

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.650
What up, my wife?

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.930
I need to go now.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.470
What's wrong, wife?

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:47.950
Are you scared?

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.590
I'm not scared,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.980
but I hate what you're going to do.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.500
You already hate me,

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:09.960
then hate me a lot.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.290
Shit.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.820
Hey what's that?

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:22.230
I.. I'm sorry.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.990
Oh Doctor, what are you
doing here in Engineering?

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.170
Move, I'm leaving.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.360
Wait a moment.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.970
And what happened to you?

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.600
I'm going back to the faculty.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.150
Perfect timing, I'm going that way.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.330
I'll give you a ride.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.840
No thanks, I can go by myself.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:04.280
You're in the belly of the beast.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:11.010
Do you want to be devoured? Or...

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.950
do you want to leave nicely?

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.730
Doctor Kan Doctor Kan!

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.080
Hey Mild, what happened to you?

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.150
It looks like he had a
rough time. When I saw him,

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.530
I quickly brought him straight back to you.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.290
Natcha, why'd you tell me
to come to this club? I'm tired.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.150
Where's your girlfriend?

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.480
She went to pray with her mom.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.040
I'm not going to be bottom, by the way.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.240
You got it.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.890
Is it good?

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.090
Don't bite your lip.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.140
Do you want to try something new?

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:00.810
Happy New Year, Doctor.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:07.130
Happy New Year, Engineer.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.700
I'm a good and trustworthy person.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.810
Thanks for bringing my brother home.

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.320
Now go.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.550
Wait!

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:44.170
Why are you acting like you don't
remember me? And what about our New Year?

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.610
What about our New Year?

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.610
I handle so many cases every day.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.480
Why should I have to remember that one?

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:57.970
Oh, but my case that day was
probably an extra urgent one.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:03.500
Sorry, but there was nothing
memorable about it. Let's go Mild.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.610
So do you like to play hard?

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.820
You'll see.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.030
Hey Knight If you're so
tough, fight me one-on-one!

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.970
Let's just end it here.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.690
But you can't just let it go like this!

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.480
He'll get even more emboldened.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.606
He'll probably do something
messed up with you again.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.630
Come on, Calm down.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:38.570
But I don't understand.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.990
Why did you have to say
you were Knight's wife.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.160
Because I didn't want him
to see that I was scared.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:00.060
Oh... so you were really
scared. Come here, come here.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.930
Just stop.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.060
Why did you steal his girlfriend first?

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.620
He probably wanted revenge
you for stealing his girlfriend,

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.020
so he's taking it out on me now.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.440
Yeah, don't worry.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.800
I'll take care of you, my dear brother.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.200
Just take care of yourself
and don't get into trouble.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:21.500
I can take care of myself.

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.350
We already hate each other,

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:52.890
so hate me even more.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:14.970
Oh, well.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:17.030
Do you resent him?

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.910
Then let's pay him back!

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:20.220
Hey, stop it.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:22.690
You're giving me a headache.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.350
Hey Mild, where are you going?

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.380
This is your room.

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:52.780
What did you do to N'Mild today, huh?

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.230
Is this time serious you?

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:08.490
If you keep hesitating.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:14.900
Be careful he might be
snatched away by someone else.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.250
Damn Per.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.440
Come on,

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.530
can't I just mean well for you?

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:48.780
The exam's over,

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.290
It was so hard!

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.890
I told you to come study with me.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:59.240
Hey, everyone gotta make
time for his girlfriend, right?

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:01.190
Single people wouldn't understand.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:02.340
Enough! Stop right now.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:05.580
Tum, I still want to graduate with you.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:07.580
Wow... that's touching, friend.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.200
But it looks like it'll
just be me and Klah left.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:10.960
Oh... Mild.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.480
Wait, wait,

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.406
hold on! So what's going
on with you and P'Knight?

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:17.110
Yeah.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:18.550
The news seems to have quieted.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:24.430
There's probably nothing to it.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:27.210
People will forget soon enough.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.910
Hey, then we should celebrate!

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:32.820
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.950
Let's go, friends!

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:44.270
Yes, P'Pat.

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.410
I just finished my exam.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:53.450
Can I go hang out with
Klah and Mild tonight?

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:57.550
What is it? You told me you were
going to watch movie together.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:59.590
Why are you with your friends then?

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.590
Are your friends more important than me?

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.000
Tum, you're doing it again!

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.810
No. It's because you're important
that's why I came to ask you first.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.090
Please.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.990
Cheers!

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:23.980
Hey Tum, is Pat really okay with this?

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.510
I got an earful.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:28.910
I have to go see her at midnight.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.550
It's curfew.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:35.590
Are you really okay with this?

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:39.540
Ah, never mind. Let's drink, drink!

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.530
Mild, Mild.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:52.300
Hey Mild, did you tell your
brother you were hang out here?

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.950
Why would I tell him?

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:57.110
Shit! What a mess!

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.270
This is gonna be trouble.

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:03.070
Hey, clam down!

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.220
Not yet!

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.960
Do you want to stop now?

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:07.390
Yeah.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.230
Do you want to go home first?

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.736
You're gonna get drunk
before you even start.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.880
I just started!

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:13.320
Hey Mild.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360
Wait.

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.090
Why are you stopping me?

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.170
You know how Mild gets
when he's drunk, every time.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:19.950
Just wait and take him home.

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:22.430
Hey, that's mine!

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:24.750
Go back.

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:26.760
He's been looking at me for a long time.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.126
He clinked his glass with me first!

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:29.510
But he looked at me first!

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.480
But he clicked his glass
with me first, didn't you see?

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.510
Hey, this is trouble!

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:33.840
Don't fight! Don't fight! I'm a doctor.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:36.710
Sorry, sorry! My friend's drunk.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:38.390
Hey, let's go home.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.970
What kind of doctor, you
jerk? Come out right now!

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.840
Let me go!

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.200
Let go of what? He's like
this every time he gets drunk.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.240
I will go to dance.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.760
What's up, my rascal.

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:04.520
Do you know me that well already?

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.860
You're about to find out.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.970
Hey shit!

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:40.960
If you're gonna be
my wife, don't just talk.

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:10.450
Hey Mild, it's all over the internet!

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.120
Yeah, it is!

00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:15.670
Instead of being quiet,
it's even more famous.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.450
Hey, my friend's famous! Super hot!

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.196
Would you like to kiss him instead of me?

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:28.760
Oh, you just said that you
went kissed P' Knight.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:30.890
Tum, Look at Mild!

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.370
He's totally stressed out and
you're still messing with him.

00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:34.410
You too.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.720
What should I do? Should
I just drop out of university?

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.060
Oh, didn't you say you
wanted to graduate together?

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.100
Yeah.

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:49.230
Mild, P' Bow wants you to
meet her in the activity Room.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.680
What's going on?

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:54.960
Don't know.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:57.650
What's it about?

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:00.310
Mild, are you busy lately?

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.710
A little bit.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:07.720
Hmm, but no matter how busy you are,
don't forget to find time for activities.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.960
University life is the most fun!

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.920
Yeah.

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:13.710
So, here's the thing.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:17.690
The hospital is organizing
a charity event to raise funds

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.820
for the hospital's foundation.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:28.860
This year, our faculty of medicine decided to put
on a play to campaign about HIV-infected patients.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:34.990
But to make the play interesting,
we need to find something new.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.860
Yeah.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:43.400
And what's new is, we're going to do
a stage play of Romeo and Juliet.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:46.440
Ah, that's not new enough.

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:50.820
But what is new is
we'll use an all-male cast

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.760
for the actors to celebrate
same-sex marriage in Thailand.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:57.550
Yeah.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.480
And Romeo will be Mr.Knight,
the head of fourth-year engineering,

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.120
and Juliet will be Mild.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:06.850
Right...

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.280
Huh?!

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:12.580
Wait teacher, why do it
have to be me and him?

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:16.650
Well, Mr. Knight insisted it had to be you.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:18.300
Have to be me?

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:19.330
Yes.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:39.980
I really have to ask for your help.

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:44.630
Alright teacher,

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.370
but I have a condition.

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:50.490
What is it?

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:55.420
I'll only play with my boyfriend, Dr. Mild.

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:10.950
Yes.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.750
What's your problem?

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.060
Stop bothering me.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.650
But I was serious.

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:37.250
Serious about me being your boyfriend
and you will act in the play only with me?

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.610
You just said that you're my wife.

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:42.870
If you want to fight, then just do it.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.280
Come on.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.800
I'm sorry.

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:52.130
I'm sorry for doing without thinking,

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:55.210
no matter what it was about.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.670
Do you hate me that much?

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.260
I don't hate you,

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:19.930
I just... like you.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.400
This time, I won't let you go again.

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:54.200
Please take these documents to Dr.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.260
Oh, Kan!

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:02.310
You've been completely
gone since New Year's!

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.300
I've been here every day,
you just haven't seen me.

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:09.370
You disappear like a ghost.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.710
Are you afraid to see someone?

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:18.480
What about you and Namfah...?

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:21.340
We haven't talked yet.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:23.060
Did Natcha tell you?

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:24.890
Yeah.

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:29.500
So what about you and
N'Per? Did you do it with him?

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:32.490
Did Natcha tell you that?

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.040
I heard it from someone else.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:39.150
They said you disappeared
with him all night.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:43.220
People probably thought you asked him to
fix the plumbing at your place or something.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:54.190
We have a meeting
tomorrow to discuss the play.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:58.420
Oh, from tomorrow, I'll
be working on the play.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.160
Don't want anyone saying
I'm running away again.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:03.560
Aren't you tired?

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.330
Yeah, I work a lot so I can forget.

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:11.450
Forget what?

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:29.540
Per, why did you take me here?

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.130
Come on, relaxing time.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.320
Per!

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.030
Oh, didn't you say you
weren't going to swim?

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.120
I gave you a head start.

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:12.150
Actually, I'm letting you win.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.800
I was afraid you'd get upset
with me, so I gave in first.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.710
Someone like you, Per?

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:22.330
Another round then?

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:23.930
That's enough.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:30.600
The weather's good!

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.900
It's damn hot. How's nice?

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:44.280
Between this doll and me,
which one is more huggable?

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:46.950
I won by a landslide, right?

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:50.920
What's your mood?

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.920
Why are you being nice to me today?

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.310
Just wanted to do something fun,

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.900
Take care of you a bit.

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:59.160
Treat you to a meal.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.690
You look tired lately.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.340
I'm always tired.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:08.780
I'm used to it.

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:10.130
See?

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.650
Because you're used to it,

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:17.730
you don't even realize how
bad your condition is right now.

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:24.770
That's why you need someone to
take care of you until you go to bed.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:30.340
Send me to bed or do what?

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.620
I'll just make it easier
for you to fall asleep.

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:40.210
No need.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.970
I'm serious,

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.920
I'm serious about you,
even if you don't believe me.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.530
Tomorrow, I think I need
to start working on the play..

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:55.960
I probably won't have time

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.840
I'll bring you food myself.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.330
I told you I don't have time.

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:07.000
This is why a good boyfriend like me
has to deliver food to you.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.760
You're messing around.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.320
Who's your boyfriend?

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.440
Oh, I forgot.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:17.030
Kan is my wife.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.590
Damn.

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:28.590
P'Per!

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.880
You haven't called me at all lately.

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:35.480
I miss you so much!

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:40.100
N'Kookai, I'm with, uh...

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.980
I'll call you later, okay?

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.790
Then P'Per, can you drop me off today?

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.520
I didn't bring a car.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:51.610
Please, please, please,
P'Per, drop me off, please!

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:54.630
P'Per, please!

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.450
Kookai, please go back
first, I'll call you later, okay?

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:02.310
My beautiful, cute, sexy Kookai.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:07.180
Okay, but you left your stuff in my room.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:08.510
Don't forget to go get them.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:22.070
Didn't you say you
were going to be serious?

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.230
It's the same as always.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:28.010
But it's your business,
not about me anyway.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.000
Let's eat.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.920
Hey Knight, didn't you say
you were going to stop bothering Mild?

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:41.880
I can't do it.

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.590
You're such a dog.

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:44.870
Yeah, maybe.

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:51.720
But this time, I'm not
letting Mild go again.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.320
If you are involved with Mild again,

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:55.786
I won't let you get away with it.

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.570
Do whatever the hell you want,

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.840
but I'll not lose Mild again.

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:04.300
All happened because of you.

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:06.890
But this time, I'm serious.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:11.970
I'm going to fix what's wrong.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:15.570
Seriously? If you were serious,

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.830
it wouldn't be like this, you idiot.

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:24.390
Hello, I'm P'Kan. I'm a
sixth-year medical student.

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:28.950
I'm the manager for this production.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.980
First off, a big thank you to all of you
for coming to help with this play!

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:38.970
Today's our first day together, and I really
want us all to get to know each other better.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.230
We'll be spending a lot of months together,

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:46.230
so it's a great opportunity
to getting to know each other.

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:48.710
For today, I've got the
script ready for everyone.

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:53.440
But before we dive into that, I'd like you all to
introduce yourselves and say who you're playing.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.220
Alright, first up,

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:59.950
we have Knight, who plays as Romeo.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:07.010
Next, we have Mild, who plays Juliet.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:13.530
And finally, Safe, who plays Tybalt.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:20.150
Today is our first day together, and I really
want everyone to get to know their new friend.

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.550
We'll be spending several months together.

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:26.306
I know it might feel a little awkward at first,
especially since we're all from different faculties.

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:29.570
But once you get to know each other
and start supporting each other,

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:32.710
I'm confident that we'll
achieve great things together.

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:38.270
Try it.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:19.510
Hey!

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:21.330
Hey Mild,

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:23.490
are you okay?

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:25.670
Sorry.

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:28.320
Alright, go take some break.

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:35.220
The snack delivery guy is here!

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.590
Juliet, Romeo is here!

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.710
Not your Juliet.

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.760
Why'd you say no?

00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:53.990
Hey, wait! Hey,

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:56.280
P'Knight! Hey, what are you doing?

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:02.930
My dearest Juliet.

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:04.530
Go away.

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:08.670
Boyfriend? My ass!!

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:11.030
Kan.

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:21.700
Kan, are you busy these days?

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.930
Why haven't you replied
to my Line messages?

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.890
Hmm,

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:31.600
how was praying with your
mom during New Year's?

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:37.940
After praying, I just went back
to sleep. I was super exhausted.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:46.090
Fah, do you think I'm really stupid?

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:50.860
Kan, why would you say that?

00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:58.640
Let's break up, Fah.

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:02.140
Wait, why?

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.670
I don't love you anymore.

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:05.730
I had someone else.

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:12.390
Do you have someone else?

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:14.230
You dared to cheat on me?

00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:15.720
How could you do this, Kan?

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:23.350
I'm not in love with you anymore,

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:26.690
I'm sorry.

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.860
Sorry? Can saying sorry can fix anything?

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.950
How could you do this?

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:33.590
How could you do this to me? Answer me,

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:36.010
How could you cheat on me?

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:37.100
Answer me, Kan!

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:38.130
Hold on,

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.610
think about it carefully.

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:48.170
What did you do on New Year's Night?

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:53.790
Let's go.

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:05.050
Are you stupid?

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:07.630
How do you break up with
someone and get slapped,

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:10.510
then act all manly saying you're
breaking up because you cheated?

00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.300
Wasn't she the one who cheated?

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:17.990
Never mind.

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:23.080
It had to end anyway.

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:28.310
It's better it ended in a
way that saved Fah's face.

00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:35.640
What about you?

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:39.830
If she was wrong, you
should say she was wrong.

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:48.810
This is the best way for it to end, Per.

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:54.740
And why you're not fighting back?

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:04.350
Don't let anyone hurt you
like this again next time.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:21.200
Thanks.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:04.120
So, wanna watch a movie at my room tonight?
