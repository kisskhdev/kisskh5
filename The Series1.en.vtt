WEBVTT

00:03:07.188 --> 00:03:08.423
You can totally do it.

00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:10.857
This is the payoff for all
the word games we used to do.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.026
And remember what I always tell you,

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.777
don't be nervous, do your best.

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:18.698
Dad, I’ll really do my best so
we can finally get the cash prize.

00:03:18.794 --> 00:03:21.630
If you do well here, you’ll get
more than just the cash prize.

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:23.219
What's that?

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:24.259
You'll see.

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:30.126
Answer it, it might be important.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.504
Just let them be.

00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:35.006
That’s yours for now.

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.224
Phones aren’t allowed on stage.

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:37.872
Okay.

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:41.012
- Thank you, Dad.
- Linette Estrella, excuse me.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:42.221
You're up next.

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:45.433
Please get ready, the host
will call you in five minutes, okay?

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.435
Uh, Daddy, we should head to
the audience area now.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:48.950
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.117
Oh!

00:03:50.142 --> 00:03:51.324
You can definitely do it.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:01.115
Welcome back to the
7th Wordsmith Youth Championship!

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.078
Defending champion, Lawrence Uy
of Kai Chang Wa Academy,

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.204
is in the lead.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:09.582
But the score is neck and neck
with the first-time Wordsmith finalist.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.960
Linette Estrella, of G.
De Jesus High School.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.337
Proving to be this year's dark horse.

00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:19.717
Gainful.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.178
That’s twenty-four points.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.931
And with one move,
Estrella is now in the lead.

00:04:25.394 --> 00:04:26.519
Go, Lin!

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:28.371
Hmm.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:30.061
Maybe in the next tournament,

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.702
Possenti might also
make it to the championship

00:04:32.727 --> 00:04:34.604
if your child plays.

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:38.419
That is, if you give her the opportunity

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.780
and make her a scholar at Possenti.

00:04:41.604 --> 00:04:43.772
Well, that's asking for too much, Vin.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:46.719
I know.

00:04:46.744 --> 00:04:48.705
That's why I'm thankful for your presence

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.540
so you could witness Lin.

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:54.210
that she could be the student
to win all of your academic competitions

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.295
if you give her the chance.

00:04:58.221 --> 00:04:59.292
You’re right.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.135
I mean, she's highly intelligent.

00:05:02.898 --> 00:05:06.652
She has a great personality and
the camera loves her. My god!

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.642
I just don’t want her go to waste

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:12.311
if she ends up graduating from
an unknown school.

00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:13.964
Miss Perez,

00:05:14.722 --> 00:05:17.683
you could change Lin’s life
if you take her into Possenti.

00:05:17.931 --> 00:05:19.891
Uy needs 57 points,

00:05:19.916 --> 00:05:21.876
to regain the lead.
Can he do it?

00:06:06.397 --> 00:06:07.648
[in Mandarin]
You dropped it.

00:06:08.109 --> 00:06:09.208
[in Mandarin]
You can do it.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.155
Jacqueries.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.208
Jacqueries.

00:06:52.148 --> 00:06:53.316
Communal uprising.

00:06:53.944 --> 00:06:55.153
Whatever.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.415
That’s 84 points.

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:03.403
Did you win the championship last year
because of that technique?

00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:05.286
What are you even saying?

00:07:07.703 --> 00:07:09.287
With the clock ticking out,

00:07:09.312 --> 00:07:12.024
Estrella needs 27 points to beat Uy.

00:07:12.049 --> 00:07:13.050
Can she do it?

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.200
Cheaters.

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:37.832
I'm sure you know what that means.

00:07:44.357 --> 00:07:45.339
She did it!

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:46.465
We have a new champion,

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:49.719
Linette Estrella from G.
De Jesus High School!

00:08:29.503 --> 00:08:30.534
Amazing.

00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:31.834
Congratulations.

00:08:32.847 --> 00:08:34.223
Congratulations to both of you.

00:08:35.485 --> 00:08:37.320
Really? So, we have a deal?

00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:39.018
We do have a deal.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.563
Thank you very much, Miss Perez.

00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:45.483
You're going to change her life.

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:49.583
Thank you.

00:09:05.927 --> 00:09:07.303
So you’ve already made up your mind.

00:09:07.328 --> 00:09:08.705
Then why are we even talking?

00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:15.721
I just wanted you and Lin
to understand why I need to leave.

00:09:19.722 --> 00:09:21.307
Don’t talk to her anymore.

00:09:21.332 --> 00:09:24.335
You’ll only end up hurting the kid
just like you’re hurting me now.

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:29.443
I’m not abandoning her. I’m just leaving…
but I’ll come back.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.033
Oh, you're leaving?

00:09:36.575 --> 00:09:37.785
I don’t want to be late, Dad.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:40.579
There might be traffic going to Alabang.

00:09:41.376 --> 00:09:42.265
But I cooked.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.376
There’s longganisa and your favorite—eggs.

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.503
Oh, I already packed food. Wait.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.982
Your uniform looks good on you.

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:51.850
Thank you.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:55.928
You know this is the first time
you’re going to school without me?

00:09:56.199 --> 00:09:57.271
Hmm.

00:09:57.419 --> 00:09:58.921
You’re so dramatic.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.808
Just eat breakfast already!

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:01.967
Hmm.

00:10:02.085 --> 00:10:03.085
Dad,

00:10:03.623 --> 00:10:04.623
thank you.

00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:08.107
Thank you. Because if not for you,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.935
I wouldn’t have become
a scholar at Possenti.

00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:13.321
What are you saying?
You don’t need to thank me.

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.198
You deserve to study in a school like that.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.743
And I want to make it up to you.

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:19.952
Make up for what?

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:24.457
I couldn’t afford to send you to a good
school in elementary.

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.458
But at least,

00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:27.585
based on your STEM performance,

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.420
you’ll graduate from a school like that.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.756
So your dream to become a...

00:10:32.061 --> 00:10:33.489
foreign scholar will come true.

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:37.845
I don’t really need
to go to college abroad.

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.473
It’s okay here, with you.

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:41.724
What are you saying?

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.273
You've wanted that since you were a kid —
and I know you.

00:10:44.852 --> 00:10:46.604
If you want something, you have to...

00:10:46.694 --> 00:10:47.724
get it.

00:10:48.045 --> 00:10:49.060
and

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.900
I’ll support that.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.819
I won’t be as strict anymore
like I was with your mom.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.071
Oh, Dad.

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:58.949
Let’s not include the people
who aren’t here.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.036
You’re the one being dramatic.

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:04.705
You should be excited and happy.
It's the first day of school!

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:09.502
Maybe I’m just anxious.

00:11:11.092 --> 00:11:12.188
I hope,

00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:14.340
even if I’m just entering senior high,

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.588
I can still make some friends there.

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.486
Why wouldn’t you?

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.723
You’re kind. You’re smart.

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:26.310
But don’t be too smart.

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:28.562
Don’t just stick to the rules.

00:11:29.578 --> 00:11:30.746
Use your heart too.

00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:33.692
- Use your heart.
- Okay?

00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:36.904
Yes, Dad. I’ll remember that and...

00:11:37.689 --> 00:11:38.864
take it to heart.

00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:41.502
Oh, that’s witty.

00:11:41.527 --> 00:11:43.737
- Are you a Wordsmith champion?
- Yup.

00:11:45.135 --> 00:11:46.705
Alright then. Go ahead,
it looks like it’s going to rain.

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:47.706
Bring this umbrella.

00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:48.749
Oh.

00:11:48.749 --> 00:11:50.835
It’s okay, Dad. That’s too big.

00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:55.631
And the weather app says there’s
only an eight percent chance of rain.

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:56.590
- Ah.
- Look.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.135
That eight is far from zero.
Just take it.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.177
Fine.

00:12:00.406 --> 00:12:01.449
You’re so persistent!

00:12:01.915 --> 00:12:04.056
- Love you, Dad.
- Love you, Linlin.

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:05.099
- Love you.
- Take care, okay?

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:06.103
See you later, okay?

00:12:06.475 --> 00:12:08.978
- See you, Dad.
- Be a good girl, Linlin.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:10.337
Dad, you're embarassing me.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.985
- Bye-bye!
- Take care.

00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:34.211
Why only now, Nona?

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:36.005
In just two more years,
she’ll be graduating.

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:37.965
We’re talking about Lin’s future.

00:12:37.965 --> 00:12:39.592
Don’t let your pride get in the way.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.010
I’m still her mother.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.013
I still have the right to decide
about our child’s future.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:47.975
You gave up that right when you left us.

00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:56.877
Please scan your ID.

00:14:35.082 --> 00:14:36.166
Principal Perez?

00:14:36.635 --> 00:14:37.845
Good morning, ma’am.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.211
Good morning.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:43.299
Thank you for accepting me to
your scholarship program.

00:14:43.324 --> 00:14:44.324
Oh!

00:14:44.888 --> 00:14:46.139
You must be Linette...

00:14:46.713 --> 00:14:47.713
Estrella?

00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:50.336
Welcome to Possenti.

00:14:50.811 --> 00:14:51.811
Thank you.

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:56.812
I actually have some time now
before my meeting.

00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:58.016
Do you want to...

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:00.232
tour around? I could bring you.

00:15:00.865 --> 00:15:01.865
Really?

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.236
I feel shy.

00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:06.655
It’s your lucky day. I have time.
Come on.

00:15:13.203 --> 00:15:16.915
I'm sure you’ll love our
newly renovated library.

00:15:17.374 --> 00:15:21.298
We pride ourselves of
having the latest academic

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:23.756
and even fiction titles straight

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.718
from publishers here and abroad.

00:15:27.743 --> 00:15:31.580
Our interior designers really
took the time to consult

00:15:31.972 --> 00:15:34.850
with experts to get the
best lighting,

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.062
airflow, to optimize
the space for studying.

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:41.065
That's how much we value our students.

00:15:41.445 --> 00:15:43.211
And our computer labs...

00:15:43.433 --> 00:15:46.561
we only use state-of-the art computers

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.285
with the latest OLED screens,

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.771
As well as the latest version
for educational softwares.

00:15:53.256 --> 00:15:55.049
Our students are well-rounded.

00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:58.374
The school has full
support for our students

00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:01.502
in the different fields of
media and sports.

00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:04.250
and of course, in the arts and music.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.344
Can anyone find the value of X?

00:16:14.228 --> 00:16:15.771
Anyone?

00:16:22.355 --> 00:16:23.940
Yes, the new girl.

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:01.603
Impressive.

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:07.442
Anyone?

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:09.611
How about you guys?

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:13.449
This is just a tenth grade refresher.

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:16.201
The new student knows it better.

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:44.395
Hi.

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:52.112
Have the auditions started yet?

00:17:53.228 --> 00:17:54.448
Are you using the room?

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:57.117
- Sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no. It's okay.

00:18:00.537 --> 00:18:02.247
Uh, I’m Grace.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.208
We're in the same section.

00:18:06.293 --> 00:18:07.544
Grace Anne Dizon.

00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:09.505
You're seated behind me.

00:18:11.965 --> 00:18:12.965
Linette,

00:18:13.091 --> 00:18:14.091
right?

00:18:15.636 --> 00:18:16.636
Just Lin.

00:18:18.388 --> 00:18:19.681
Nice meeting you, Lin.

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:26.063
I know we just met but

00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:28.190
I was wondering if you could help me.

00:18:28.792 --> 00:18:31.294
I heard you play and you’re really good!

00:18:35.572 --> 00:18:37.741
so I was thinking if you could
help me rehearse

00:18:38.028 --> 00:18:39.446
while the others are not here yet.

00:18:39.471 --> 00:18:40.471
Is that okay?

00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:43.037
Sure.

00:18:45.874 --> 00:18:46.874
No problem.

00:19:00.902 --> 00:19:07.116
♪ Lovingly. Oh, how long have
I longed for you... ♪

00:19:08.008 --> 00:19:10.302
♪ And me. ♪

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:12.276
♪ Lovingly ♪

00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:18.073
♪ Oh my heart I give to thee. ♪

00:19:19.837 --> 00:19:22.535
Oh my god, that part again.

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:25.572
I'm sorry. I'm off-key.

00:19:26.324 --> 00:19:28.250
Lord, you know,
I don't even know how I'm going

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.044
to be the Ibong Adarna if I'm
always off-key.

00:19:31.044 --> 00:19:33.213
I can't even reach that high note.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.800
That play really means a lot to you, huh?

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:37.901
Yeah.

00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:40.153
It's always been my dream to be on stage.

00:19:40.178 --> 00:19:43.599
Like Broadway levels, ever since
grade school in New Jersey.

00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:46.618
You grew up there?

00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:48.537
Yeah,

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:49.730
with my late mom.

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:52.441
Uh, but I’m with my dad now...

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:55.068
and he would kill me

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.946
if he ever finds out that I want
to study theater

00:19:57.946 --> 00:19:59.489
instead of business management.

00:20:00.461 --> 00:20:01.308
But

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:03.316
maybe if I get this lead part,

00:20:03.589 --> 00:20:05.174
I can prove myself to him.

00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:07.205
The problem is...

00:20:09.124 --> 00:20:10.334
my voice sucks.

00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:12.461
So maybe that's why.

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:13.495
No, it doesn’t.

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:15.213
If that’s your dream...

00:20:15.786 --> 00:20:16.787
You should go for it.

00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:18.884
No matter what anyone says.

00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:22.304
And your voice is nice,
the song’s just really difficult.

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:24.907
Here.

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.034
Can you try singing along?

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:28.952
Ready?

00:20:28.977 --> 00:20:30.687

Oh my god. You are the best.

00:20:53.377 --> 00:20:55.087
Seriously. Thank you so much.

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:57.005
I’m so glad I found you here.

00:20:57.714 --> 00:20:58.714
Thank you.

00:20:59.466 --> 00:21:00.550
Anytime.

00:21:02.758 --> 00:21:06.220
Okay, just remind the company
that this version is pitched down, okay?

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:07.532
Okay.

00:21:07.557 --> 00:21:09.726
- Good luck. Break a leg.
- Thank you.

00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:11.227
And Lin.

00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:12.938
just one last thing.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.608
Do you think you could wait for me...

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:17.985
until I'm done?

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.070
if you're not doing anything.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.700
I’m not.

00:21:25.283 --> 00:21:27.494
Sure, I’ll wait for you.

00:21:28.096 --> 00:21:29.096
Yay.

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:30.914
Thank you. I...

00:21:31.581 --> 00:21:34.376
would feel less nervous knowing that
someone is there for me.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.210
Thank you, sis.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.920
Anytime.

00:21:39.172 --> 00:21:40.172
- See you.
- Sis...

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:44.802
Hi.

00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:47.931
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:21:59.943 --> 00:22:01.820
- Hey, guys. I'm back.
- Hi, Grace! How was the audition?

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.820
Grace.

00:22:03.447 --> 00:22:04.447
Hi.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.366
- I'll get back to you.
- Okay, see you later.

00:22:06.366 --> 00:22:07.826
- How are you? How’d it go?
- Hey.

00:22:09.786 --> 00:22:11.038
I pulled it off...

00:22:11.872 --> 00:22:12.872
kinda.

00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:16.153
But,

00:22:17.085 --> 00:22:18.101
it’s no use.

00:22:18.532 --> 00:22:20.325
I'm not allowed to join the school play.

00:22:20.547 --> 00:22:21.965
Huh? Why not?

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:23.674
Well,

00:22:24.384 --> 00:22:25.969
there’s this new rule.

00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:28.578
Everyone involved in the
school production must

00:22:28.603 --> 00:22:32.774
at least have an 85% minimum average.

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:34.269
Like, hello?

00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:38.523
You know, my grades have
not even reached 82.

00:22:40.442 --> 00:22:42.611
Why does the required
grade have to be so high?

00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:43.778
Right?

00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:47.032
Like what does Algebra even have to do
with acting and singing?

00:22:48.575 --> 00:22:49.575
Well,

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:52.579
we can’t really do anything
if those were the rules.

00:22:53.934 --> 00:22:55.144
I know, it's just

00:22:55.169 --> 00:22:56.462
It's so unfair.

00:22:58.736 --> 00:23:00.446
Don’t be too focused on being smart.

00:23:01.088 --> 00:23:02.756
Use your heart, too.

00:23:02.781 --> 00:23:04.783
I’ll remember that and...

00:23:05.626 --> 00:23:06.877
take it to heart.

00:23:20.067 --> 00:23:21.234
Uh, Grace.

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:24.986
if you want, I can tutor you in Math.

00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:29.491
If your grades go up, maybe you can
audition in the next production.

00:23:30.951 --> 00:23:32.202
Wait. Really?

00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:33.829
- Yeah.
- As in,

00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:35.163
you’re gonna tutor me?

00:23:37.207 --> 00:23:40.293
Oh, thank you! You're so nice, sis.

00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:41.836
Sis?

00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:43.713
Sorry. Is that okay?

00:23:44.714 --> 00:23:45.841
Feeling close?

00:23:47.634 --> 00:23:48.634
It’s okay!

00:23:49.211 --> 00:23:50.302
Sis.

00:23:51.825 --> 00:23:54.186
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:23:55.399 --> 00:23:57.026
Okay, how about this? So,

00:23:57.519 --> 00:24:00.605
this page here is actually
what Mr. Sevilla provided.

00:24:08.697 --> 00:24:09.697
Oh, Dad!

00:24:09.953 --> 00:24:10.953
Lin.

00:24:11.575 --> 00:24:12.784
It’s only your first day of school.

00:24:12.784 --> 00:24:14.035
Why did you go home so late?

00:24:14.452 --> 00:24:16.997
Well, I went straight to night classes.

00:24:17.093 --> 00:24:18.838
Didn’t want to waste the chance to earn.

00:24:20.046 --> 00:24:21.506
You’re so hardworking.

00:24:22.002 --> 00:24:23.002
Not really.

00:24:23.985 --> 00:24:24.986
Have you had dinner?

00:24:26.006 --> 00:24:27.674
It’s okay, I’ll eat later.

00:24:27.674 --> 00:24:28.842
- You sure?
- Mhmm.

00:24:29.092 --> 00:24:30.302
I’ll just heat up your food.

00:24:30.327 --> 00:24:32.163
So how was your first day?

00:24:33.096 --> 00:24:34.096
It was okay.

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:38.935
On a scale of 1 to 10,
I’d say probably

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:40.729
an 8.5?

00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:43.607
What? Why not 10?

00:24:44.691 --> 00:24:46.067
The school’s really big.

00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:48.778
The facilities are great, but...

00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:51.990
the student culture there feels different.

00:24:53.546 --> 00:24:55.881
But I’m happy
because I made a new friend.

00:24:55.906 --> 00:24:57.741
I'm actually tutoring her tomorrow.

00:25:01.877 --> 00:25:03.460
Oh no, Pa...

00:25:04.544 --> 00:25:05.962
Here we go again.

00:25:06.588 --> 00:25:08.840
Okay, let's move your head first.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.058
Go get some rest first.

00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:25.815
Ready for class, Teacher Lin?

00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:27.651
Teacher Lin, really?

00:25:31.238 --> 00:25:32.530
But seriously,

00:25:33.657 --> 00:25:34.991
thank you for doing this.

00:25:34.991 --> 00:25:37.244
You know, I was actually thinking
of signing up for

00:25:37.244 --> 00:25:39.037
Sir Sevilla’s class, but...

00:25:39.871 --> 00:25:41.373
this is much better.

00:25:41.915 --> 00:25:44.793
Sir Sevilla has a tutorial class
for the same subject?

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.960
Yeah.

00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:47.549
Is that allowed?

00:25:47.858 --> 00:25:48.858
Mhmmm.

00:25:49.005 --> 00:25:50.005
Is it free?

00:25:50.488 --> 00:25:52.073
Well, of course not.

00:25:53.074 --> 00:25:54.200
But, you know...

00:25:54.734 --> 00:25:59.239
a lot of teachers offer these kinds of
tutorial classes outside of school.

00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:02.852
Oh, here. I’ll show you.

00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:05.729
Look,

00:26:05.764 --> 00:26:09.643
These are the exercises Sir Sevilla
gave his tutorial students.

00:26:09.841 --> 00:26:11.734
I got that from one of our classmates.

00:26:11.897 --> 00:26:13.190
But my gosh.

00:26:13.285 --> 00:26:15.204
I don’t understand...

00:26:15.771 --> 00:26:16.843
anything.

00:26:18.326 --> 00:26:19.744
Interesting.

00:26:23.779 --> 00:26:25.865
He hasn’t discussed this in class yet.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:38.666
Okay, then there.

00:26:39.014 --> 00:26:40.056
Then this...

00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:41.558
equals...

00:26:42.031 --> 00:26:44.311
How are you doing that?

00:26:46.368 --> 00:26:47.494
Okay, here’s how.

00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:49.818
- You can factor the—
- Hey, Grace!

00:26:50.817 --> 00:26:52.402
why weren’t you at the reading earlier?

00:26:54.612 --> 00:26:55.612
Oh...

00:26:55.736 --> 00:26:59.031
You weren’t qualified
for the first auditions, right?

00:26:59.404 --> 00:27:01.447
I am qualified, okay.

00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:04.247
- My grades don't.
- That’s the same thing.

00:27:04.593 --> 00:27:05.957
It's the same thing.

00:27:06.702 --> 00:27:08.328
You’re still not part of it.

00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:10.879
Of course, to be a good actor...

00:27:11.463 --> 00:27:13.131
you can’t just rely on acting.

00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:15.800
You need brains too.

00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:18.887
- Really, Claire?
- I'm just kidding, Grace.

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:20.764
You’re so sensitive.

00:27:32.025 --> 00:27:33.193
Let it go.

00:27:33.693 --> 00:27:36.863
Just focus on Mr. Sevilla’s long test.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.320
All right.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.412
Okay, let’s get back to the equation.

00:27:44.412 --> 00:27:45.830
There’s a shortcut here.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.749
because if 3x squared minus—

00:27:49.584 --> 00:27:51.002
Get one and pass.

00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:13.108
Sis.

00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:15.235
Why are you crying?

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:18.530
I'm done for, sis.

00:28:19.447 --> 00:28:23.201
I was up all night trying to practice
all of the problems.

00:28:24.619 --> 00:28:27.247
I can't remember anything.
I don't know.

00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:31.751
And if I fail this test,
I won’t be able to audition.

00:28:33.128 --> 00:28:34.170
Just relax.

00:28:34.712 --> 00:28:37.090
When you see the problems,
you’ll remember.

00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:38.967
You got this.

00:28:42.637 --> 00:28:46.391
As soon as you finish your paper,
leave your paper on the desk.

00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:48.225
Good luck.

00:29:10.165 --> 00:29:13.126
Bustamante, the test is easy, right?

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.313
If you actually paid attention in class

00:29:15.338 --> 00:29:17.757
and listened during the tutorial class...

00:29:18.772 --> 00:29:20.487
this test is a piece of cake.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:32.770
It's the same?

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:36.733
These are the exercises Sir Sevilla
gave his tutorial students.

00:29:37.484 --> 00:29:39.527
He hasn’t discussed these in class yet.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:49.870
Sis.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.044
It’s the same as the
exercise sheet you gave me.

00:29:56.503 --> 00:29:57.503
Huh?

00:29:57.629 --> 00:30:00.423
- Which one?
- The one you showed me.

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:08.932
If I catch any of you cheating,
I’ll rip your test papers in half.

00:33:43.229 --> 00:33:44.355
Thank you.

00:33:56.909 --> 00:33:58.035
Thank you.

00:34:02.498 --> 00:34:05.001
Oh my God! Perfect!

00:34:06.548 --> 00:34:07.715
Did you know that

00:34:07.837 --> 00:34:12.425
this is the first time I ever got
a perfect score in my entire life?

00:34:13.211 --> 00:34:16.506
Drama queen. Congrats to us, sis.

00:34:16.531 --> 00:34:17.657
Yes, congrats.

00:34:19.015 --> 00:34:20.015
But sis,

00:34:21.827 --> 00:34:22.828
that'd be the last, okay?

00:34:24.604 --> 00:34:26.814
We might not get away with it next time.

00:34:27.774 --> 00:34:29.525
Of course, it won't happen again.

00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:32.236
Good thing Mr. Sevilla didn’t notice.

00:34:34.113 --> 00:34:35.473
But seriously, one more thing.

00:34:36.407 --> 00:34:37.533
Don’t tell anyone.

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.242
I won’t.

00:34:40.012 --> 00:34:41.012
Thanks, sis.

00:34:45.655 --> 00:34:46.655
Lin.

00:34:48.336 --> 00:34:49.754
Congratulations.

00:34:50.361 --> 00:34:51.904
Especially you, Grace.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.843
You both got perfect scores on our test.

00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:58.971
It’s like a miracle from
St. Gabriel Possenti.

00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:02.266
We reviewed together, actually.

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:04.268
I tutored her myself.

00:35:05.561 --> 00:35:06.561
Well,

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.230
good job.

00:35:10.983 --> 00:35:14.111
Uh, just so you know,
I was a student too.

00:35:15.071 --> 00:35:17.073
So if you’re cheating...

00:35:20.701 --> 00:35:22.411
just don’t let me catch you.

00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:48.980
Are we okay wearing uniforms here?

00:35:49.438 --> 00:35:51.899
Yeah, it's fine.
Pat’s family owns this place.

00:35:52.458 --> 00:35:53.960
Hello, Ma'am Grace.
Sir Pat is already here.

00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:55.319
Okay. Thank you.

00:35:58.766 --> 00:35:59.766
Hon.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.868
What took you so long?

00:36:02.368 --> 00:36:03.536
It's traffic.

00:36:04.704 --> 00:36:05.704
Hi, Lin.

00:36:06.247 --> 00:36:07.247
Hi.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:08.820
Have a seat.

00:36:16.549 --> 00:36:17.549
Raymart.

00:36:22.346 --> 00:36:23.472
Here’s the menu.

00:36:25.057 --> 00:36:26.183
Thank you.

00:36:26.287 --> 00:36:27.297
Order what you want.

00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:34.614
You can order for me, Grace.

00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:36.109
You sure?

00:36:36.903 --> 00:36:41.574
Okay. Ah, one truffle pasta and
two prime ribs, medium.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:43.450
Thank you, sir.

00:36:53.971 --> 00:36:54.972
Oh, no thank you.

00:36:55.556 --> 00:36:56.640
I don’t drink.

00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:59.008
Don’t worry. We’re legal here.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.703
I don’t like drinking either.

00:37:01.802 --> 00:37:04.096
Ah, she’s a good girl, hon.

00:37:05.723 --> 00:37:07.224
Are you really a good girl?

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.268
or deep inside, you're bad?

00:37:12.183 --> 00:37:13.517
Because if you’re really good,

00:37:13.542 --> 00:37:15.961
you wouldn’t have shared
your magic eraser with Grace.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.200
Hon!

00:37:18.986 --> 00:37:20.363
Sorry, sis.

00:37:20.633 --> 00:37:22.635
Me and Pat, we tell each other everything.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.660
So...

00:37:23.866 --> 00:37:25.034
I told him.

00:37:26.827 --> 00:37:27.827
Chill.

00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:30.122
Your secret’s safe with me.

00:37:30.623 --> 00:37:31.874
It’s nothing to me.

00:37:32.807 --> 00:37:33.807
If it’s nothing to you,

00:37:34.335 --> 00:37:35.378
then why bring it up?

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:37.171
You’re a scholar.

00:37:37.797 --> 00:37:39.382
That means you’re a smart girl.

00:37:39.882 --> 00:37:42.677
But it also means you need other
people’s money to study.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:46.931
Our money.

00:37:48.182 --> 00:37:50.226
So let’s help each other get what we need.

00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:51.686
What do you want, Pat?

00:37:52.311 --> 00:37:53.311
I want in.

00:37:54.163 --> 00:37:57.062
I want you to share your answers
with me just like with Grace.

00:37:57.087 --> 00:37:58.087
Hon!

00:37:58.651 --> 00:37:59.651
What the hell?

00:38:00.423 --> 00:38:02.217
Let’s help each other out, Lin.

00:38:03.906 --> 00:38:05.449
Sorry, it’s a hard no.

00:38:06.033 --> 00:38:08.244
I did that to help a friend —
not for money.

00:38:08.494 --> 00:38:10.162
And I may not have money,

00:38:10.997 --> 00:38:12.498
but I have principles.

00:38:13.249 --> 00:38:14.417
What principles?

00:38:14.867 --> 00:38:17.036
You really think what you did
with Grace was right?

00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:19.255
It’s the same thing.

00:38:22.526 --> 00:38:23.819
If you help me out,

00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:26.288
you’ll get paid for your hard work.

00:38:26.626 --> 00:38:28.252
It’s a win-win situation.

00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:50.369
My weekly allowance is probably twice
what your family makes in a month.

00:38:52.413 --> 00:38:54.040
If you help me out...

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:56.208
you’ll get paid for your hard work.

00:38:57.877 --> 00:38:59.003
I’m not running away.

00:39:02.133 --> 00:39:04.552
I promise by next week,
I’ll have the money,

00:39:04.592 --> 00:39:07.219
because my advance request at
work already got approved.

00:39:07.762 --> 00:39:09.221
I’m really sorry. I’m sorry.

00:39:09.221 --> 00:39:11.515
I just really need it for my daughter.

00:39:12.308 --> 00:39:13.308
This is the last time.

00:39:14.602 --> 00:39:16.854
I’m sorry, okay?
Thank you, thank you.

00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:21.429
How long have you been there?

00:39:23.289 --> 00:39:25.250
Did you borrow money again from uncle?

00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:27.615
Or is that from a loaning app?

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:30.743
Don’t worry about it.

00:39:30.743 --> 00:39:32.286
What was it for, Dad?

00:39:33.245 --> 00:39:34.830
Why did you say it was for me?

00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:37.124
I don’t need the money.

00:39:37.792 --> 00:39:40.920
You know what, just get some rest
and we’ll talk about it later.

00:39:41.462 --> 00:39:42.462
Dad!

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:44.130
Please.

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:53.140
I wasn’t even supposed
to tell all this but,

00:39:56.125 --> 00:39:57.167
that was for your tuition.

00:39:58.708 --> 00:40:01.711
But I’m a scholar.
We don't need tuition.

00:40:04.026 --> 00:40:05.736
When I spoke with

00:40:05.986 --> 00:40:09.073
Principal Perez about your
admission to Possenti...

00:40:10.407 --> 00:40:13.035
she mentioned they’ve
already been supporting a student

00:40:13.035 --> 00:40:14.578
since Grade 7.

00:40:15.663 --> 00:40:17.706
She was supposed to
take back our agreement.

00:40:17.805 --> 00:40:18.805
But luckily,

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.293
she changed her mind.

00:40:21.293 --> 00:40:22.293
So,

00:40:22.942 --> 00:40:23.942
for now,

00:40:24.348 --> 00:40:26.266
you’ll have to split the scholarship.

00:40:27.383 --> 00:40:28.150
But just—

00:40:28.175 --> 00:40:29.176
just for one semester.

00:40:30.177 --> 00:40:31.320
Next semester,

00:40:31.345 --> 00:40:32.680
you’ll have the full scholarship.

00:40:35.432 --> 00:40:37.643
Why didn’t you tell me this, Dad?

00:40:38.686 --> 00:40:41.147
The tuition costs one
hundred thousand pesos!

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.417
- I’ll just go back to my old school—
- That’s not an option.

00:40:45.442 --> 00:40:47.361
We can’t afford that, Dad.

00:40:48.571 --> 00:40:50.239
If I had known those were the terms,

00:40:50.239 --> 00:40:52.741
I wouldn’t have accepted the scholarship.

00:40:55.218 --> 00:40:56.231
Lin,

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.207
Possenti was the only school
willing to offer you a scholarship

00:41:00.207 --> 00:41:01.458
even as a senior high student.

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:03.043
I couldn’t let that go.

00:41:03.335 --> 00:41:04.712
So if I have to borrow money

00:41:04.712 --> 00:41:06.630
just to pay your tuition, I’ll do it.

00:41:07.173 --> 00:41:09.675
You don’t have to do that, Dad.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:13.253
I see how you barely get any sleep.

00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:16.537
You never rest.
And even now, this late at night,

00:41:16.562 --> 00:41:18.689
people are still coming
after you for debts.

00:41:19.158 --> 00:41:20.792
I feel bad for you.

00:41:25.562 --> 00:41:26.562
I’m sorry, Dad.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.110
I’m sorry.

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:32.489
I feel guilty too because

00:41:33.005 --> 00:41:35.049
I know all of this is because of me.

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:37.745
Why would you feel guilty?

00:41:40.721 --> 00:41:41.917
This is my job.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.586
I’m your father, aren’t I?

00:41:50.507 --> 00:41:54.094
So whatever needs
to be done for you, I’ll do it.

00:41:56.639 --> 00:41:57.640
I can handle it.

00:42:01.477 --> 00:42:02.477
Lin,

00:42:04.021 --> 00:42:05.397
do you know why

00:42:06.148 --> 00:42:08.776
I’m not afraid to borrow money for you?

00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:15.532
Because I believe so much
in your intelligence.

00:42:15.991 --> 00:42:18.077
I believe in you.

00:42:21.372 --> 00:42:24.333
It’s just the first semester,
my child. I can do this.

00:42:26.585 --> 00:42:28.837
I just hope you also believe
that I can do this

00:42:28.837 --> 00:42:31.465
for you the same way
I believe so much in you.

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:37.387
Okay?

00:42:50.818 --> 00:42:51.818
Sorry, Dad.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.320
Don't mention it.

00:43:28.196 --> 00:43:29.196
Hey, Kid!

00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:31.846
Let me help you. What’s your name?

00:43:31.995 --> 00:43:33.501
Simon. But it’s okay.

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:34.657
I can do it myself.

00:43:35.979 --> 00:43:37.892
So, what are you doing
in the high school wing?

00:43:38.317 --> 00:43:40.801
And how did your toy
end up with the balloon?

00:43:40.826 --> 00:43:42.578
My classmates.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.789
They pranked me. I chased them here.

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:48.183
They do this to me all the time.

00:43:48.208 --> 00:43:50.669
If they’re always like that,
that might be bullying already.

00:43:51.712 --> 00:43:52.712
I don’t know.

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:56.258
I just really need that toy.
My dad gave it to me.

00:44:00.054 --> 00:44:02.014
You might fall trying to reach that.

00:44:05.029 --> 00:44:06.531
You know, you’ll only reach that

00:44:06.556 --> 00:44:08.057
if you grow taller.

00:44:09.021 --> 00:44:11.565
But if you’re only eight years old now,

00:44:11.565 --> 00:44:13.759
it might take you five more years
to reach that height.

00:44:14.693 --> 00:44:15.693
Okay, let me just help you.

00:44:15.718 --> 00:44:16.718
Come here.

00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:21.324
There.

00:44:22.534 --> 00:44:23.534
Got it.

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:32.626
Oh no! Your shirt got dirty.

00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:35.672
It’s okay.

00:44:36.102 --> 00:44:38.009
It’s nothing. That’ll wash out easily.

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:40.677
Is she your girlfriend?

00:44:46.433 --> 00:44:47.976
You little rascal.

00:44:50.646 --> 00:44:51.646
Your balloon?

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:52.606
Don’t want it anymore.

00:44:52.606 --> 00:44:54.316
Just give it to your girlfriend.

00:44:56.276 --> 00:44:57.319
Say thank you.

00:44:58.028 --> 00:44:59.363
Thank you!

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.370
By the way, I’m Tristan,

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.330
but everyone calls me Bank.

00:45:08.705 --> 00:45:10.249
Grade 11, Section B.

00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:12.709
I’m Lin, also Grade 11, Section A.

00:45:16.102 --> 00:45:17.088
Lin...

00:45:18.298 --> 00:45:20.300
- Lin Estrella?
- Yeah, why?

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:23.053
You don’t know me?

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.680
I’m Bank,

00:45:26.265 --> 00:45:27.265
Tristan Bangkat.

00:45:28.934 --> 00:45:30.859
I’m the one you took the scholarship from.

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.607
Wait. I didn’t take it from you.

00:45:35.607 --> 00:45:36.483
We’re sharing the scholarsh—

00:45:36.483 --> 00:45:38.026
I don’t want to share it.

00:45:39.027 --> 00:45:41.953
And I'm sure you don’t want to share it
until Grade 12 either, right?

00:45:42.432 --> 00:45:44.767
But we can still be friends, right?

00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:46.702
I don't think so.

00:45:47.536 --> 00:45:49.455
Maybe it’s better if we’re not friends.

00:45:50.038 --> 00:45:51.165
Because if we’re not friends,

00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:53.584
only one of us will end up sad—
whoever the school chooses

00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:54.585
as their scholar.

00:45:55.544 --> 00:45:56.795
I think that’s the best option.

00:45:58.005 --> 00:45:59.423
But if we are friends,

00:45:59.882 --> 00:46:02.676
whoever they choose between us,
we’ll both end up sad.

00:46:40.547 --> 00:46:41.757
Oh, Dad.

00:46:42.132 --> 00:46:43.592
Sorry, I didn’t see you there.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:45.510
It’s beautiful.

00:46:45.761 --> 00:46:46.803
Although,

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.598
Why does your piece sound so sad?

00:46:53.463 --> 00:46:54.480
You know,

00:46:54.505 --> 00:46:56.924
why don’t we make music content instead?

00:46:57.189 --> 00:47:00.526
What do you think,
would I make a good vlogger?

00:47:00.526 --> 00:47:02.152
Yuck, Dad!

00:47:04.488 --> 00:47:07.533
Good thing you thought about
tuning Leslie again.

00:47:08.283 --> 00:47:10.202
And look, she's dust-free.

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:12.788
Well, it’ll make her more
appealing to the buyer, right?

00:47:13.687 --> 00:47:14.687
What?

00:47:14.957 --> 00:47:15.958
No, it’s just that…

00:47:16.416 --> 00:47:18.710
I don’t really have time
to play anymore, so…

00:47:19.294 --> 00:47:20.295
It’s a waste.

00:47:20.602 --> 00:47:22.771
Better to be practical these days, right?

00:47:22.796 --> 00:47:23.922
Oh, this might be the buyer.

00:47:24.299 --> 00:47:25.299
Hold on.

00:47:26.374 --> 00:47:27.374
Hold on.

00:47:28.379 --> 00:47:29.379
Hello?

00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:40.232
All because of me.

00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:10.131
- When you’re done, fix the bar, okay?
- Okay, Sir.

00:48:10.156 --> 00:48:11.156
Pat.

00:48:14.391 --> 00:48:16.184
You look cute without your uniform on.

00:48:17.769 --> 00:48:18.812
Thirty thousand.

00:48:21.356 --> 00:48:22.399
Smart girl.

00:48:24.856 --> 00:48:25.857
Thirty thousand?

00:48:25.881 --> 00:48:27.341
Sure. No problem.

00:48:28.008 --> 00:48:29.009
One condition.

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:32.701
Your score and Grace’s should be lower
than mine, so it’s not obvious.

00:48:34.494 --> 00:48:35.494
Done.

00:48:36.112 --> 00:48:38.176
As long as my average is eighty-two.

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:39.290
I'm good.

00:48:40.334 --> 00:48:41.334
Do we have a deal?

00:48:53.978 --> 00:48:55.813
You may now start answering.

00:48:56.212 --> 00:48:59.016
Kasmala
Performed by: Alamat

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:40.864
Eraser.

00:50:40.889 --> 00:50:41.889
Hand it over.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.199
Estrella, Estrella, Estrella!
Let's talk.

00:51:17.199 --> 00:51:19.075
Do you want your classmates
to get mad at you?

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:20.453
Why would they be mad at me?

00:51:20.619 --> 00:51:22.454
All of you will be in deep trouble.

00:51:22.454 --> 00:51:23.747
It's not worth it.

00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:25.040
Are we the ones in trouble,

00:51:25.999 --> 00:51:26.999
or you?

00:51:30.879 --> 00:51:32.839
Oops! Sorry, Banky.

00:51:33.006 --> 00:51:34.257
Did not see you there.

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:35.275
This month,

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.385
Possenti has been chosen

00:51:37.601 --> 00:51:40.604
to represent the Teen Genius Quiz.

00:51:40.629 --> 00:51:43.257
Whoever gets the most points

00:51:43.282 --> 00:51:46.744
will be granted full scholarship
next semester.

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:51.149
Do you really think you got here
fair and square?

00:51:51.186 --> 00:51:53.281
If the school's making money off us...

00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:56.154
let's also make money off them.
