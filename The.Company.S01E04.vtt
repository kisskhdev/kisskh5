00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.280
Morning, Min.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.200
You're here.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.070
Give it to me.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.990

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.600

(On-duty Consultation Room)

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.311
A urinary tract infection,

How many grams of nitrofurantoin
should be given per dose?

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.360
Eight jin is four kilograms.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.870
Nitrofurantoin per kilogram...

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.120
Per...

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.240
Sixteen milligrams per dose.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.710
Right.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.360

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.680
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Tang.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.560
You're welcome.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.120
You can't even
answer something this basic?

00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:47.590
No wonder it's been three years

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.380
and you still haven't
gotten the vet license.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.750
Jenny,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.360
could you give me a few more days?

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.150
What?

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.430
Selling the place?

00:02:56.444 --> 00:02:57.910
(Staff Lounge)
That won't work.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.000
Where am I supposed to live?

(It seems his life isn't
going too well.)

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.240
We should at least respect the contract.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.080
You were the one who had me sign
for three years back then.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.190
You can't be

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.800
changing your mind at the last minute.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.800
What's going on? Why are you so mad?

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.733
Who are you yelling at?

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.520
Look at the lighting.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.800
Great airflow and ventilation.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.240
Take a look. Feel free.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.960
(This place is so cramped and narrow.)

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.430
(I never imagined his life
would be this rough.)

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.240
The young man living here
is a top student.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.750
A doctor at a top-tier hospital.

00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:42.630
The longer he stays,
the more energetic he gets.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.560
He even got himself
a girlfriend recently.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.630
Really?

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.470
Yeah.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.840
Look.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.150
(There are none
of the items Ziyi usually uses.)

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.680
(Nor any token
that could prove his identity.)

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
(Did he come from another time?)

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.430
(There's no telling.)

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.800
Give me a call once you've decided.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.840
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:02.550
Hey, stop right there.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.680
Who are you?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.755
What are you doing here?

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.840
Sorry to bother you.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.680
You're not leaving.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.840
Explain yourself,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.200
or you're not leaving this room.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.150
I'm actually Su Beilu's cousin.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.600
Su Beilu has a cousin?

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.870
Why haven't I heard of that?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.950
How are you going to prove
you're his cousin?

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.600
He's not a doctor
at a top-tier hospital.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.480
He's a vet assistant at a pet hospital.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.240
And he doesn't have a girlfriend.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.910
Cousin, huh?

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.120
I was just trying to sell the place.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.480
It was a well-meaning lie.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.560
He's actually been
having a hard time lately.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.600
Taking the place back right now

00:04:37.688 --> 00:04:38.710
wouldn't be very nice.

(No Pets Allowed. Move Out If Violated.)

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.240
It's just a temporarily

(Available Balance: 380 yuan)

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.560
(I'm so useless.)

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.390
(It seems there's only one way left
to confirm his identity.)

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.000
I bought you breakfast.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.360
You paid my rent for me, didn't you?

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.600
Jenny told me

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.070
a cousin helped me pay for it.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.160
I don't have any cousins.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.360
I knew

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.270
it couldn't have been Chun Ge.

00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:03.600
It could only have been you.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.920
Or maybe some other relative?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.800
Impossible.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.430
Jenny told me

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.120
that my cousin is just like me,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.360
well-groomed and presentable,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.390
just a bit weathered.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.480
So it could only be you.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.560
That definitely wasn't
Jenny's exact wording.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:18.870
No need to thank me.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.920
I still should.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.750
I've already written an IOU.

00:07:23.288 --> 00:07:25.310
I'll pay you back
once I get paid next month.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.480
(IOU)
May I ask something bluntly?

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.600
How did you

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.950
end up unable to pay rent?

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.000
Doesn't that feel like a failure?

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.310
Originally,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.240
I promised my mentor

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.270
that I'd pass
the veterinary licensing exam.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.480
But it's already the third year,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.800
and I still haven't passed.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.430
I never became
a licensed doctor either.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.070
It does feel like a failure.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.430
Is the exam that hard?

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.680
For some people, probably not.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.390
But I just can't pass it.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.870
Maybe in my past life,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.070
I simply wasn't cut out for studying.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.200
Impossible.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.120
What I mean is,

00:08:16.355 --> 00:08:17.830
you may not like studying now,

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.750
but it doesn't mean

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.750
you never liked it before,
or never will.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.600
Maybe.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.680
Honestly,

00:08:25.822 --> 00:08:28.070
it's not that I absolutely
have to become a doctor.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.040
I don't have any grand ambitions.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.030
I think that for one person

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:34.510
to have a job

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.510
in life

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.270
and to be able to help animals,

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.080
to be healthy and out of trouble,

00:08:40.133 --> 00:08:41.960
and to live safely and peacefully
is enough.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.360
But why is it

00:08:46.422 --> 00:08:48.270
that everyone keeps
forcing me to improve?

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.030
There's a saying here too,

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.670
"Escaping is shameful,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.320
but it works."

00:08:56.355 --> 00:08:57.750
You don't need to persuade me.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.080
Right now,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.480
I just want to escape.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.910
There are many useful ways.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.910
Escaping isn't the only one.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:09.590
Come with me.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.080
Let's clear your head.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.320
Where are we going this time?

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:26.220
(Yashe)

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.200
The sunset here is incredible.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.790
I've never seen a sky this beautiful.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.120
If you look at it long enough,

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.150
you'll grow tired of it, too.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:50.720
Which dynasty

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.000
is this?

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.630
This place actually doesn't
belong to any dynasty.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.030
So where is this?

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.350
This place

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.840
is called Tianguang Market.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.320
Market?

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.360
It simply means a place of trade.

00:10:05.377 --> 00:10:07.950
This place is under the jurisdiction
of the Time Administration.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.360
You can think of it as a wormhole,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.870
or a tear in time.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.080
It was because this place was discovered

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.270
that in our era,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.200
time travel became possible.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.720
I don't get it.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.150
I knew you wouldn't.

00:10:23.711 --> 00:10:25.390
You know this one at least, right?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.030
An hourglass.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.200
You can think of different timelines

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.000
as the two ends of an hourglass.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.600
This place is Tianguang Market,

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.600
a shortcut for time travel.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.790
Why do the people here

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.600
look like they're
from different dynasties?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.910
Because Tianguang Market
connects different timelines.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.510
People often stumble in here by chance.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:49.870
To survive,

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.630
they can only trade supplies here,

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.360
waiting for the day they can leave.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.270
Time here is frozen,

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.870
so things never change.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.120
There is only dusk,

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.360
never night.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.030
Hence the name Tianguang Market.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.550
All the clocks here don't move.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.440
Here, they have no meaning at all.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.150
They're the most useless things.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.080
Then,

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.670
can they still go home?

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.510
If they can come in,
they can naturally go back.

00:11:19.577 --> 00:11:20.870
They'll return to their origins,

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.270
with nothing changed.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.360
As for when they can return,

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.870
that's no longer within their control.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.030
I'm just glad they can go home.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.720
Otherwise, being trapped here

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.790
would be pretty dreadful.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.550
Weren't you just saying

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.320
how much you liked the sunset here?

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.440
That's not the same thing.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.840
Without family, without friends,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.360
no matter how nice a place is,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.630
you wouldn't be happy there.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.630
Look at that tree.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.360
It's so big and so red.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.000
Pity that the Forgetting Tree

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.600
stands for oblivion.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.120
Oblivion?

00:12:34.222 --> 00:12:36.450
(Times Change)
Though the crimson clouds are brilliant,

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.390
the past is faint and cannot be traced.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.870
People here

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.000
come and go without end,

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.150
yet no one can stay.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.870
Just like these leaves.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.440
They can never remain
on the branches forever.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.720
But looking at scenery this beautiful,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.670
I ended up forgetting some things, too.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.910
Work,

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.240
rent,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.150
exams,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.270
and life plans.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.910
I forgot all about

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.000
these maddening woes.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.480
Thank you.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.670
You're welcome.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.030
Have you been here before?

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:13.230
No.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.440
Let's go.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.600
Bizhi,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.720
you never told me your friend is loaded.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.870
Can you let me stay here?

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.910
I don't mind how long.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.390
When we meet the owner later,

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.750
be mindful of your words.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.200
There's only one thing you should say.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.120
What is it?

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.150
The nice stuff.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.360
Praise her beauty.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.720
Praise her makeup.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.910
Praise how graceful she is.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.870
Any kind of compliment, don't hold back.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.000
Say it all, okay?

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.510
Who are you?

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.870
Buddy,

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.390
you're really beautiful.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.080
Well, your makeup looks great, too.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.480
Your skin is so delicate.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.780
(Chu Qiu, Guard Captain)
Like a flower.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.270
Chu Qiu, he's my friend.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.200
Let him go for now.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.040
A friend?

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.360
Chu Qiu.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:15.750
Don't be rude.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.340
(Lord of Tianguang Market)

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.840
He's my guest.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.240
Let him go.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.200
My lord.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:49.750
Thank you, fairy.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.480
What did you call me?

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.840
A fairy.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.510
When I saw you walking over from afar,

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:56.755
I thought you looked beautiful.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.510
I didn't expect that up close,

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.710
you'd be even more beautiful.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.600
Just look at this.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.150
Your makeup is so exquisite.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.510
And this red dress of yours,

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.960
was it custom-made just for you?

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.750
It suits you perfectly.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.150
Are you serious?

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.790
I never lie.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.440
Bizhi,

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.600
your friend certainly has
a sweet tongue.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.550
His name is Su Beilu.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.390
This is the Lord of Tianguang Market.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.360
Why don't you greet her?

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.240
So, you're the lord here.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.270
You're so young,

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.320
yet you have such a vast estate,

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.360
and you manage so many people.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.960
You're truly gifted.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.030
Alright, alright.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.440
Since you're a guest,

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.390
I should naturally show you around.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.030
For now, Bizhi and I have
important matters to discuss.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.000
Chu Qiu,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.955
I'll leave him to you.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.320
Actually,

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.320
it's fine if we don't tour.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.350
Oh?

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.270
Is my Tianguang Market not beautiful?

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:50.910
It is.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.110
Go on.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.240
That's more like it.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.630
I looked for that Fish-patterned Mirror
twice for you.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.480
Payment and goods are now settled.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.840
Where is the item?

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.120
This is the remaining payment
for the mirror.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:14.960
They are two different deals.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.630
Don't get them mixed up.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.600
Fair enough.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.120
Across the entire realm,

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:24.600
you're truly
the best businessperson of all.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.000
What's this?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.960
Open it and see.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.600
The red-blue flowers of Yanzhi Mountain
are the most fragrant.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.320
Blush made from these red-blue flowers

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:38.910
really lives up to its reputation.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.320
You do have a discerning eye.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.510
The spacetime coordinates
of the next antiquity.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.350
Thank you.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:54.630
There's one more thing

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.080
I'd like to ask you.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.350
Go on.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.390
After that great fire years ago,

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.790
my friend's belongings were
scattered across different timelines

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.750
and caused energy disturbances.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.510
I want to know,

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:11.310
if objects can be like this,

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.760
what about people?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.840
People?

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:16.110
Can people also be like objects,

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.350
suddenly appearing in another timeline?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.480
Did you meet someone?

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.720
In the twenty-first century,

00:17:24.133 --> 00:17:26.666
(Time Shifts, the World Changes)
I met someone called Su Beilu.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.510
He looks exactly
like that friend of mine.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.030
The weather's really nice today.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.920
The temperature's pleasant, too.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.680
How long have you been here?

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.590
I think it's been quite a long time.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:42.590
Do you miss home?

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.070
Are you married?

00:17:45.177 --> 00:17:46.310
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.640
What do you think lies
at the end of this river?

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.790
I heard it's something called

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.550
a time rift.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.200
Then, where does this river flow to?

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.480
What are you doing?

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.400
Don't you find this
really stress-relieving?

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.720
You seem pretty stressed.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.820
Come on, join me.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:19.640
What was that noise?

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.720
My friend just startles easily.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.640
Ignore him.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.200
Have you seen him in Tianguang Market?

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.960
Then, the price has to be recalculated.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.200
That's a bit much.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.550
I'm joking.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.960
Why can't you take a joke?

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:44.550
Then, go on.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.480
He has never been to Tianguang Market.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.030
Think again.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.000
He really hasn't.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.640
Even if he had been here,

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.680
he could only return
to where he came from.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.070
Those who can freely travel
through time using Tianguang Market

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.200
are extremely rare.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.000
Besides, your friend has
such a sweet tongue.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.680
I'd definitely remember him.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.030
So, that means

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.270
he isn't that person.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.440
That's not what I meant.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.070
I only know what happens
within Tianguang Market.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.720
Thank you.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.240
I do have one more idea.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.240
Why not use the Yashe
to take a look at his past?

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.350
That way, his origin

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:42.960
will be clear.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.030
(No need to keep guessing.)

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.590
This place is really nice.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.933
I don't know if I'll get
another chance to come back.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.240
Let me take a few more looks.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:10.670
Let's go.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.170
Don't move. Don't speak. Follow me.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.050
Hurry.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.270
Drop your weapon.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.350
Throw it away.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.520
Get on.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:29.870
Don't move.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.660
Lan, get on the boat.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.480
Row.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.720
Faster.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.680
Su Beilu.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.590
Bizhi, save me!

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:39.600
Don't shout. Hurry.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:40.830
- Row faster.
- Move.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.590
Hey.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.350
From the way you're dressed,

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.790
you're also from
the twenty-first century.

00:21:00.888 --> 00:21:02.010
We're from the same place.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:02.960
Shut up.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.800
Row faster.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.580
That way.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.300
Into the fog. Hurry.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.750
Faster. Go faster.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.080
I'll row with you. Go to the back.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:21.840
Careful.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.510
I'll go check ahead.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.700
You...

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:32.880
Don't be nervous.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.480
We won't hurt you.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.880
Are you

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.400
from ancient times?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:39.840
I am.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.110
But he isn't.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.350
Then, why are you

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.240
leaving together?

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.750
We met in Tianguang Market.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.240
But one day,

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.350
we'll have to return to our own eras.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.440
That's why we're trying

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.510
to find a way to leave
Tianguang Market together.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:58.960
Don't chit-chat with him.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.440
We'll stop here.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.440
Once we leave the thick fog,

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.750
you row back on your own.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.880
Can you leave after passing

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.510
through the fog?

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:09.440
Yes.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.070
They say the dense fog over
the River of Oblivion is the exit.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.520
Feng.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.440
If we can't

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.720
leave together...

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.520
That won't happen.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.640
We'll definitely leave together.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.110
But once you leave Tianguang Market,

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.160
if you come to my era and are forever

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.440
separated from your parents and family,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.160
would you be happy?

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.790
As long as I'm with you,

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.310
I'll be happy.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:52.920
And honestly,

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.830
I had nothing

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.480
in my own era.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.420
I'm willing to go to your era.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:04.550
But that would be

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.200
far too unfair to you.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:14.400
(Who would have thought)

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.030
(that it would turn out
to be a love story?)

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.240
The fog...

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.080
Row.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.310
Row, row faster.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:42.550
We're already inside the fog.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.310
Why hasn't anything changed?

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.070
Go deeper into the fog.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.240
Why are we back again?

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.480
This feels like a maze.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.030
Turn around. Quickly.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.160
Market Lord.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:27.590
I am the Lord of Tianguang Market.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.440
I offer you both this advice.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.350
The River of Oblivion
is like a sea of suffering.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.110
Turning back is the wiser choice.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:38.920
You're the Lord of Tianguang Market?

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:40.590
Fine.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.910
Then tell me,

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.960
on what grounds are you keeping us here?

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.590
We want to leave now.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:46.630
Let us go.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.070
You should know

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.310
the one trapping you here is not me,

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.310
but this time rift.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.240
Tianguang Market is a time rift

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.400
because it connects countless eras.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.110
When people from different eras

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.750
are unable to return for the time being,

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.680
it is because the entrances
and exits of time are closed.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.070
But the operation of those gateways

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.310
is like the rising
and dispersing of this fog,

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.733
ever-changing and unpredictable.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.270
Even I cannot accurately foresee

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.920
when the gate
to your world will open again.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.680
No one knows.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.590
I want to go to her era

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.310
and live together with her.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.720
Here,

00:25:31.466 --> 00:25:33.550
we don't even know
when we'll be able to leave.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.590
I don't want to
be separated from her. Am I wrong?

00:25:36.888 --> 00:25:38.200
I want to be with her forever.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.400
Is that not allowed?

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.880
You say that in this place,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.550
lovers never know
if the next moment will part them.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.830
But what about your world?

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.310
Isn't it the same there?

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.720
This place

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.110
is no different from any other world.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.400
Don't you understand yet?

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.240
I don't!

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.720
Is there really no other way?

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.080
No.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.200
All you can do

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.640
is treat every moment as the last.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.560
Feng.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.590
Don't be sad.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.200
No matter what,

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.510
until we finally part,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.350
I'll stay with you.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:40.030
Coming here was

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.790
completely unexpected.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:44.960
Meeting you

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:47.110
was an even greater, unexpected joy.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.160
So,

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.960
why not treat every moment we share

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.830
as a blessing?

00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.910
Here.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.510
Remember this.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:04.240
This blade

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.400
is meant to carve the finest,
most gentle jade in the world.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:10.350
I believe in you.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.160
You'll definitely be able

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.310
to carve the most
exquisite piece with it.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.800
I'm sorry.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:01.680
I meant to help you clear your head.

00:28:01.777 --> 00:28:03.830
I didn't expect you
to witness something like this.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.830
Maybe from the very beginning,

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.880
I shouldn't have involved you at all.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.030
I'm fine.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.440
They didn't mean to hurt me anyway.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.510
They just wanted to be together.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.720
I can understand that.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.150
But

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.270
the Market Lord caught them.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.590
Will they be okay?

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:27.590
They will.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.830
They'll return to their own eras.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.110
Then, won't they see each other again?

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.640
People from different eras

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.880
are destined to part.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:50.630
How about this?

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.000
To make it up to you,

00:28:52.022 --> 00:28:53.070
I'll treat you to a meal.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:54.350
Sure.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:55.240
Barbecue?

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.480
Since it's to make amends,

00:28:57.733 --> 00:28:59.030
we should get something good.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.520
Let's go.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.720
So, what are we having?

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.760
Western food?

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.720
Chinese food? Japanese food?

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.750
That ninety-nine yuan
all-you-can-eat salmon place?

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.540
(As Time Passes, the Stars Shift)

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.720
Market Lord.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:34.200
What is it?

00:29:34.311 --> 00:29:36.480
I've verified the identities
of that man and woman.

00:29:36.555 --> 00:29:37.640
It was indeed an elopement.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:38.830
Nothing unusual.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.590
That's good.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:45.000
These are their identity records.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.350
Please take a look.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.350
Xia Zelan.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.240
Lu Feng?

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.110
So that person just now was Lu Feng?

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.100
(Year 2024)

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.100
(Huayang City)

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.480
So refined.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.840
Sir.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.510
This is your pre-meal champagne.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.550
Can I start eating?

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.400
This place is so luxurious.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.510
It must be expensive.

00:30:43.155 --> 00:30:45.110
I haven't been back
to Huayang in a long time.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.480
You brought me to Huayang.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.640
There must be a reason, right?

00:30:48.244 --> 00:30:49.880
Are you here to recover an artifact?

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.240
What is it? Where are we getting it?

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.080
And from whom?

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.640
All these years,

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.510
I've travelled through time alone

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.110
in search of ancient objects.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.480
I've gotten used to it.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.440
Getting you involved

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.350
was regretful.

00:31:07.466 --> 00:31:08.590
Everything that's happened

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.510
might affect the course of your life.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:11.870
So...

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:14.880
So, you're trying to thank me?

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:16.750
Thank me for my selfless spirit?

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.720
It's okay.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.200
If this happens again,

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.070
I'll still help you without hesitation.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:29.640
This beef...

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.830
Look at the marbling.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:35.960
What I meant

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:37.920
was actually...

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.400
I understand.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:42.240
You're saying I eat too roughly, right?

00:31:42.377 --> 00:31:43.520
I'll take smaller bites.

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:49.190
Go on, eat.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:50.590
Eating

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:52.680
is meant to be an enjoyment.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.110
As long as you're happy.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:59.350
Watch your step.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.000
Mr. Lu, please.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.110
Is he the person you're looking for?

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.310
I think so.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.240
It's him!

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:23.640
You know him?

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.310
He's the one from Tianguang Market.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.480
The one who held me hostage.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:27.750
He was wearing a mask,

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:28.911
so you didn't recognize him.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:33.670
But...

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:35.110
Why does he

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.590
look so much older?

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.070
Time is frozen in Tianguang Market.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.750
There would be no change when he left.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.080
I suppose

00:32:43.311 --> 00:32:45.240
he must have left
more than ten years ago.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.920
So that's how it is.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.000
He's making it all so romantic.

00:32:54.288 --> 00:32:55.550
Do you think he might have

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:57.777
brought his girlfriend
from Tianguang Market with him?

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.040
Lu Feng.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.910
Nana.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.830
You're dressed beautifully.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.070
Come, sit.

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:17.160
That's not the woman
from Tianguang Market.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.920
Why does she look so familiar?

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.350
I feel like I've seen her before.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.310
Isn't she that influencer, Nana?

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:24.830
She's actually here?

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:26.870
She...

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:27.840
Na...

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:28.870
Nana.

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:31.030
She's a really famous influencer.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.000
How did those two end up together?

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.960
You'd never have guessed it.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.030
I didn't realize you were this gossipy.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.240
This is truffle foie gras.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.310
Please enjoy.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.000
This place is really hard to book.

00:33:45.266 --> 00:33:46.733
You really went to a lot of trouble.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.350
You said you liked
their truffle dishes.

00:33:49.555 --> 00:33:50.820
Even if it's hard to get a table,

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.533
I still wanted to
make it happen for you.

00:33:52.533 --> 00:33:53.350
Then, I'll try it.

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:54.350
Go on, have a taste.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.550
I've got a solo exhibition tomorrow.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.830
You'll come, right?

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:08.710
What I want most

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.150
is for you to be standing by my side.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.390
Really?

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.030
Does an artist like you
really need me there?

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.880
I don't buy it.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:21.430
Nana,

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.880
you might think I know a lot of people,

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.230
but to me,

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.550
you're one of a kind.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.320
You know,

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.320
in our line of work, there's a lot
of fake smiles and flattery.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.200
But with you,

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.880
I mean it.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:38.760
What a jerk.

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:47.480
I never said I wasn't going.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.480
Stop scrolling on your phone.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:03.390
Come on, cheers.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.030
I'll try some too.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.800
That wasn't meant for me, was it?

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.540
(See you tomorrow.
If we don't meet again, I'll miss you.)

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.960
"See you tomorrow."

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.150
"If we don't meet again,

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.510
I'll miss you."

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.760
I didn't write that.
It must've been my assistant.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.977
It was sent to a group, right?

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:31.360
How many did you send it to?

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:32.350
Nana.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.550
I'll make sure
they're more careful next time.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.510
Your assistant really knows you well.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.440
This...

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.550
The truffles aren't fresh.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.760
I can't eat this.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:40.670
I'm leaving.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:41.510
Nana!

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:43.470
Nana!

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.480
Was that Nana?

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:49.960
She got that upset already?

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.920
Shouldn't we...

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.160
Nana.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.190
Nana, hear me out.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:58.920
Nana. Nana, let me explain.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.030
Don't touch me.

00:36:01.555 --> 00:36:03.480
If you really want to go back,
take my car.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.360
I'll call a ride.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:06.070
Nana.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.550
You've really misunderstood me.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.440
Everyone's under
huge pressure for this exhibition.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.590
That message was sent

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.590
just to get more guests

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.000
to show up and support me.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:19.590
It was sent out in bulk.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:20.480
But you

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.377
were the only one
I came to invite in person.

00:36:22.377 --> 00:36:23.710
Doesn't that show how I feel?

00:36:27.666 --> 00:36:29.880
Nana, you'll come
to my exhibition tomorrow, right?

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.030
Drive safe, please.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.960
Zhang, go settle the bill.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.222
Have the car come pick me up.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.680
Lu Feng.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.320
Do you remember me?

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.800
You are...

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.630
We met at Tianguang Market.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:53.960
Where?

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.480
We were rowing on the river.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:56.510
You even...

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.160
Nice to meet you.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.160
Nice to meet you.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:04.230
My friend and I wanted to talk to you.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.230
Do you have a moment?

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.670
My car's here.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.066
I've got an exhibition tomorrow.

00:37:08.111 --> 00:37:09.480
Add my assistant on WeChat.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.644
We'll get in touch later.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:12.550
No, wait.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:13.710
Sorry, Mr. Lu is in a hurry.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.044
Let's exchange contact details.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.760
Sorry about that.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.720
Don't forget.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:26.030
Why did he act like
he didn't know me at all?

00:37:27.688 --> 00:37:29.360
He definitely doesn't remember you.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.360
People who leave Tianguang Market
lose their memories.

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:34.670
That really happens?

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.550
Tianguang Market is a time rift.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.420
Strictly speaking,

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:40.110
what happens there
doesn't belong to any timeline.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.590
But I went there, too.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:44.711
Why didn't I forget anything?

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.550
You entered through Yashe.

00:37:46.577 --> 00:37:49.000
That's different from people
who wander in by accident.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.400
Do you think he'll contact us?

00:37:52.533 --> 00:37:54.070
If you're waiting for him to reach out,

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:55.480
you'll probably be disappointed.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.480
What do we do?

00:37:57.022 --> 00:37:58.400
There's nothing we can do.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.710
We came all this way

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:01.550
for nothing?

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.920
Since we're already here,

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.840
take a look around.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.510
Big cities really are different.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.800
Huayang has changed so much.

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.990
Bizhi.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.320
The future...

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.670
What's it like?

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:27.190
Is it like sci-fi movies,

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:28.590
with cars flying through the sky?

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.070
No, wait, maybe it's more like

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:32.880
every household has its own aircraft.

00:38:33.555 --> 00:38:34.550
Instant teleportation?

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.550
Then, what are future homes like?

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:39.590
Are they all really tall?

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:41.510
So tall they disappear into the clouds?

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:43.230
And housing prices
must be expensive, right?

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:44.110
Do you own a place?

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.510
How many rooms?

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:46.350
Is it...

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:52.760
I have one room.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.840
There's a bed,

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.630
a chair,

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.590
and a window.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.120
That's it?

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.550
Bare walls and nothing else.

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:14.440
But technology lets me
have anything I want.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:18.550
That still sounds boring.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.710
I think the present is more interesting.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.230
It feels alive.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.720
Look.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:25.590
I can scroll on my phone.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.630
All these cats and dogs,

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.710
and funny clips

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:30.670
are great.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.440
Once you start scrolling,
you can't stop.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.030
(Top influencer Nana has recently been
revealed to have a new relationship.)

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.960
(So, she has been taken.)

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.000
Isn't that Lu Feng?

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:41.840
(This lucky man)

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.550
(is an artist named Lu Feng.)

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.230
(The two were photographed dining
together at a high-end restaurant.)

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:48.710
That's Lu Feng!

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.960
He's trending!
