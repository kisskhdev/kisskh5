Can't you see I need help?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.960
Coming.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.960
Don't you pretend not to see.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.880
Unbelievable.

[The air conditioner says to keep cool.]

[The clock says to treasure every moment.]

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.200
[And guess who utters]

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.920
[the wisest words of all?]

[It's the toilet.]

[you need to let it go.]

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.760
[Did you get that?]

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.000
That makes perfect sense.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.320
Keep cool

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.840
and let it go.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.320
This is golden words.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.480
Well,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.720
I wish Ailing had seen

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.720
this video sooner.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.680
Speaking of Ailing,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.000
I haven't heard from her

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.079
since she left this morning.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.040
I need to give her a call. Hold it.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.720
Where's my phone?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.960
You can use mine.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.040
Where should I put this to dry?

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.280
Is that even

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.520
a question?

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.600

What brings you here?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.480
May I help you?

Today's seminar focuses on studying in the UK.

Mrs. Zhou.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.480
Welcome!

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.040
Should I share?

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.959
Yes.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.120
Your success story.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.840
The word "parent" is simple,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.280
but the responsibilities

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.880
it entails

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.280
are anything but.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.240
We need to play different roles

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.920
in our children's lives.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.840
We are

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.520
their guiding light in their lives.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.640
You need to

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.440
strengthen

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.760
your willpower.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.840
Clutch this ice cube

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.520
tightly in your palm.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.360
Tell yourself you're not afraid of the cold.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.520
You're not afraid of the cold.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.440
The horizons we set as parents

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.240
determine

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.000
our children's starting point

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.520
and anchor their life's journey.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.440
I knew it.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.040
You've never stuck with

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.280
anything since you were a kid.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.880
Learning piano

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.120
is the best example.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.480
Back then, so many people didn't even

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.080
make 20,000 yuan a year, but I still

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.520
spent 20,000 yuan to buy you a piano.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.000
Your father and I gave

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.200
everything we had for you.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.080
I sold the apartment in Canada,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.800
because

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.080
I want you and Dad

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.360
to have your own life.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.080
You don't

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.600
have to keep

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.720
sacrificing for me.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.520
You've sold

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.159
our apartment

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.600
in Canada?

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.880
Second,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.680
we should be

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.240
their safety net.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.640
My daughter studied in Canada

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.880
for six years,

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:58.640
and I accompanied her for six years.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.920
Because I want to tell her,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.680
her mother is

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.240
where her home lies.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.280
What's going on?

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.080
It's okay.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.960
We're going back.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.080
Third,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.880
we must become

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.640
their friends.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.160
My daughter and I have no secrets.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.520
You keep hiding everything

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.240
from your own mother

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.360
over and over again.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.880
Do you still think of me as your mother?

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.440
I'm also very happy that

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.680
she's so thoughtful

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.800
and appreciative of my efforts.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.560
Did I do wrong in arranging

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.800
your life with all my heart?

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.159
Mom, I've spent twenty years

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.120
of my life obeying

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.720
your arrangements.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.240
I have never

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.640
accused you.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.400
I followed

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.159
your every instruction.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.600
You're not the only one

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.080
who's given everything,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.800
okay?

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.640
But you've seen

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.280
the outcome now.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.200
We're both unhappy, right?

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.520
I want to live my own life.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.000
What life?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.240
The life I love.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.760
I also wanted to have my own life.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.560
You were my whole life.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.800
But you tell me

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.440
that I have failed.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.200
My story to share?

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.680
My story of failure?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.560
Mrs. Zhou, what are you doing?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.800
Mrs. Zhou!

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.400
My success

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.120
is an illusion!

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.840
What are you doing?

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.320
You!

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:47.120
Do you really believe...

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.159
Mrs. Zhou!

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:50.120
...what you say on stage?

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.600
Have you asked your children

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.640
what they want?

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.440
what their dreams are?

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.240
Pause the seminar.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.840
Did you ask them what their dreams are?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.640
Dismissed!

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.200
What's your problem?

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:02.680
No.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.360
Stop daydreaming.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.520
[It's not true.]

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.120
[No.]

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.960
[Don't listen to her.]

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.960
[Don't listen to her.]

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.840
[What's your problem?]

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.200
How useless!

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.760
This is my final warning!

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.720
Shame on you!

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.120
This is my final warning!

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.840
Please leave.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.840
No, it's not like that.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.840
[Please have a seat.]

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.760
[Please have a seat.]

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.040
[Let me explain.]

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.800
[Mrs. Zhou may have]

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.120
[encountered some setbacks.]

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.880
[We can't help her with that.]

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.320
Keep an eye on her.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.840
She can't do this again.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.720
You're right.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.560
I'm truly sorry

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.200
for the trouble.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:37.760
Thank you.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.000
You should be thankful

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.280
they won't sue you for damages.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.360
Thank you so much.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.520
I apologize for the trouble.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.440
It's okay.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.880
Well, then.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.760
Thank you.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.920
I'm really sorry.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.560
Take care of her.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.040
Alright, we'll be heading out now.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.880
[Officer, you may contact me]

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.880
[for any follow-up]

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.000
[anytime.]

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.000
Jianbin.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.200
Aiying.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.680
I've picked her up.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.920
She's with me now.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.480
Don't worry.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.080
She's doing okay.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.720
Don't worry.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.120
I'll take a break from work

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.920
to stay home with her.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.840
Thanks, but we'd better not put you out.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.480
And...

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.120
I... yes.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.280
Okay. Don't worry, Aiying.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.480
I'll hang up.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.480
See you.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.360
Where are you going

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.280
all by yourself?

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.320
Let's go home.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.360
Is there still a home?

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.400
Everything is fine.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.000
It's okay.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.760
Where do you want to go?

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.720
I'll be there with you.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:51.600
Okay?

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.120
Where's the car?

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.120
I took it in for repairs.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.840
What can I do for you?

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.840
Cancel the household.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.400
Is it your elder's?

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:17.800
Yes.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.080
Do you want to keep her ID card?

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:20.840
Yes.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.240
Then,

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.280
I'll cut a corner off

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:24.840
the card.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.040
You keep the card

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.640
as a keepsake.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.280
Okay. Thank you, officer.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.520
Thank you.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.560
Your dad

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.760
bought me

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.960
a new apartment.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.400
Do you know why

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.000
I refused to live there?

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.480
Because of the pigeons?

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.320
It isn't entirely because of the pigeons.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.080
The older I get,

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.920
the more

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.880
I realize

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.720
that one

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.920
cannot possess too much.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.920
The more you have, the less at ease you feel.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.040
The more you have, the heavier the burden.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.640
Sometimes, it can

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.040
make you forget what's truly important.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.040
The walls are covered with photos,

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.400
yet none show

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.720
clearly the faces of those dearest.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.640
Life should be

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.800
less burdened,

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.000
freer

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.400
and simpler.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.240
Look at these pigeons.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.760
How carefree they are!

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.760
Animals are much easier

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.400
to communicate with than people.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.359
[I've recorded your words. Maybe I can compile]

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:07.000
[a collection of]

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.920
[Huang Shufen's Quotations.]

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.680
[You little punk!]

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.280
Your grandma's hospitalized?

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.720
Is she feeling better?

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.000
She's an interesting old lady.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.440
She raised

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.640
so many pigeons all by herself.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.560
She even got a dog

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.760
a while back.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:43.960
That's my dog.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.920
I'll still keep the pigeons

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.600
and the dog.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.240
I'll keep this place clean.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.080
[Okay.]

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.240
[I'm just asking]

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.280
[on behalf of the neighbors.]

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.720
I've taken care of your funeral

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.000
and kept

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.160
your ID card.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.960
I also fed the pigeons.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.960
Only one thing left:

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.520
I need to tell my dad.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.800
But I don't know how to tell him.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.040
We've only met a few times.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.760
Should I go?

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.280
Kaiyang, take off your cap, so I can see you

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.560
clearly.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.200
Still remembered to come by?

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.880
You've got a heart after all.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.680
Have you seen your mom?

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.680
How is she?

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.720
She's doing fine.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.440
Don't look at me like that.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.840
I'm your father.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.240
I know

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.240
what you're thinking.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.680
All these years,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.840
I've single-handedly

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:55.840
kept this

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.080
entire business

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.120
and the family running.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.840
But I went astray

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.240
and have been punished.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.280
I accept

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:20.600
this outcome.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.320
Your two uncles

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.160
are

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.400
good-for-nothing losers.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.800
Your aunt

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.400
is even worse.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.760
She's a bully at home.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.120
In the past,

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.640
whenever

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.120
they ran into trouble in their business,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.520
they could only

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.760
count on me to fix it.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.120
But now

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.200
they're on their own.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.360
Tell them

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.560
to solve their

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.800
own problems.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.680
And, remember,

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.080
if you get into trouble,

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.400
don't count on them.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.680
They're too weak

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.160
to help you.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.040
You should also visit your mom.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.040
The prison we're transferring to

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.000
is very far away.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.160
Besides you,

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.960
the one I worry about the most

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.680
is your grandma.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.040
But I can't

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.840
look after her for now.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.320
You've grown up.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:28.840
Don't forget

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.840
you were raised by your grandma.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:31.760
Grandma...

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:33.440
What?

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.120
She's gone.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.360
What? Say that again?

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.080
What?

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.520
Grandma is gone.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.640
I kept vigil for her.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.800
I'm here just to tell you this.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.120
[Walking out the door,]

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.480
[I bid farewell to my former self.]

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.760
[I once had so much]

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.240
[but didn't cherish it.]

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.680
[Now,]

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.840
[I have only myself.]

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.440
[Grandma was right.]

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.440
[Animals are easier to communicate with than people.]

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.520
This is Ruinuo Study Abroad Agency.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.680
Tangtang's mom?

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.600
Yes. May I help you?

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.880
Well,

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.120
I have submitted

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.200
all the materials you gave me.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.280
But the school needs

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.640
supplementary materials about

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.400
the student's special talents.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:25.760
How about this?

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.280
You can stop by our office

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.920
so we can discuss this in detail.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.600
Okay?

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.280
Alright. It's okay.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.560
Sir, the car's fixed.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.320
Come take a look.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.760
If it's okay, please sign here.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.480
Here.

Zhang.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.400
You're back.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.000
Where did you go?

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.560
Everywhere but

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.080
the Himalayas.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.240
[Young folks know how to live it up.]

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.240
[It's not about young and old.]

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.720
[Help me check the circuit.]

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.120
I'm going to Mount Everest.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.480
Stop dreaming.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.920
Not before you finish the G318.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.560
Don't burst my bubble.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.640
Did I?

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.800
Quit halfway.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.360
Zhang, right over there.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.680
Is this the circuit board?

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.240
Yes.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:22.880
Let me take a look.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.120
Right. I told you something

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:32.600
wasn't taken off.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.160
Put it on the table.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.000
So, Mr. Lin,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.360
your recommendation letter

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.760
is very good overall.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.760
It's just that a few parts

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.360
sound a bit like Chinglish.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.400
It reads like

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.240
it was machine-translated.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.800
[What do you mean?]

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.800
[You mean my English isn't good enough?]

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.560
No. I just think

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.560
it's a bit unnatural.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.560
[Unnatural?]

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.600
[I've written many recommendation letters.]

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.640
[First time an agent]

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.800
[dares to correct my English!]

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.200
[What they value]

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.600
[is the weight of]

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.080
[a professor's personal recommendation.]

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.120
[Do you understand?]

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.360
Mr. Lin, please don't misunderstand.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.880
That's absolutely not what I meant.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.480
It's just that

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.360
the admissions committee

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.480
for Qian's target school

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.920
is particular about grammar.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.840
And I want to

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.000
get all my clients admitted.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.240
I'm under pressure too.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.120
[Stop!]

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.560
[I say a few words and you start crying?]

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.760
[I can't stand you young people]

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.920
[who go abroad funded]

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:33.640
[by your families]

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.760
[and think you're]

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.480
[so great.]

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.520
[Don't think just because your family]

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.360
[sent you abroad for a bit]

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.800
[you're actually something!]

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.640
[To put it bluntly,]

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:42.600
[people like you]

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.120
[are just leeching off your parents!]

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.840
[What right do you have]

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.120
[to question a professor's]

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.040
[writing style?]

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.080
[Since you're so confident,]

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.400
[find someone else]

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.840
[to write the recommendation letter!]

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.080
Xinying,

00:26:59.160 --> 00:26:59.920
his attitude

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.720
was actually quite mild.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.520
We've dealt with much worse.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.800
We're used to it.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.000
You'll get used to it too.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.240
You can't even get a car by yourself.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:35.960
On such a hot day,

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.320
you had to drag me along.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.320
We're here.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:44.880
Right here.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:50.960
What?

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.800
I... I meant to

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.960
give you a surprise.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.840
But I feel

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.800
I should apologize first.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.200
I acted before telling you.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.320
It's just...

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.360
What do you mean?

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.640
I sold our old car

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.360
and bought this one.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.240
Are you crazy?

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.360
I thought we were picking up the car?

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.720
This is the car.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.280
You're not joking, are you?

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:29.880
I'm not.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.200
Fine.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.440
From now on,

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.720
live however you want.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.560
No, no.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.280
Listen to me.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.280
What are you doing?

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.040
Just listen...

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.320
Listen to me, alright?

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.760
Why bother?

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.880
I admire you Lus.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.560
Always acting first.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.720
What do you

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.560
even take me for?

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.040
No, Ailing. Just listen...

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:46.640
You never

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.800
discuss anything with me, do you?

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.600
No. Listen...

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.200
Hear me out.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.120
You just want to make my life difficult.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.400
No. Listen...

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.320
Just listen to me, alright?

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.160
What do you have to say?

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:55.640
I've been

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.600
reflecting a lot lately.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.000
I think it's my fault.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.040
It really is my fault.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.840
I think I've made a mess

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.000
of planning our lives.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.160
- You think?
- Right.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.800
You think I can still believe

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.080
anything you say now?

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.160
You... You can believe me one more time.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.160
Look,

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.520
haven't we always been

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.760
trying to live up

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.200
to what we think

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.760
other people

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.480
expect of us?

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.480
I haven't!

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.480
I have.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.720
Back then they said

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.520
foreign companies were good.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.320
So I got a job at a foreign company.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:27.920
And they said

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.680
we should send kids abroad.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.360
So we sent our daughter abroad.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.240
For that,

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.840
I made you quit your job

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.280
to go accompany her.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.440
It's like

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.600
we've become

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.680
the envy of others.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.680
But only we know

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.480
if that's really

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.360
the life we wanted,

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.000
right?

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.240
And

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:51.800
these past few years...

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.920
I've been with you...

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:05.800
What...

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.640
What's wrong?

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.400
What is it? Tell me.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.760
You are the most important person to me.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.920
Now I don't even have time

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.640
to hold you in arms.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.360
This... This isn't

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.880
the life I want.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.280
When we were young, I promised

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.560
I'd take you traveling around the world.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
But

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.400
look at our passports.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.120
Yours

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.320
only has a Canadian stamp.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.920
Well,

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.160
we don't even have

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.560
shared travel memories.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.800
I feel like such a failure.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.400
I'm sorry.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.880
What's gotten into you today?

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.200
I...

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.840
I've decided now.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.920
From now on,

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.000
let's live for ourselves.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.520
From now on,

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.400
no matter where we are,

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.600
as long as we're together, that's home.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.600
So I went mad

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.840
and you're too?

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.640
No. You...

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.960
I'm not good with words.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.360
And I'm not very good

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.200
at romantic things.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:36.760
Starting today,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.320
give me another chance

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.880
to pursue you, alright?

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.840
Alright my foot.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.320
Let's be romantic for once.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.520
Let's take a spontaneous trip.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.720
Shall we go home?

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:55.880
You're out of your mind.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.360
Come here.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.080
Come here.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.520
Can you even cook here?

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.360
Yes. You can even use the bathroom.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:10.920
There's even a washing machine.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.840
You're so full of ideas.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.160
What do you think?

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.160
I'm fine.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.200
Let him do it.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:21.960
It's fine.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.240
Put it there.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.000
I'll get it.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.040
Don't move.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:26.720
Move aside.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:27.600
Get it up.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.640
Did you get everything?

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.360
All set.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.760
Seven suitcases and eight bags.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.920
Think about it. A whole life's worth

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.520
is just these dozen bags.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.080
So what if you have more?

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.800
You can't take it with you when you die.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.120
Having a few memories is good enough.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.200
Anyway, I've figured it out.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.960
For the rest of our lives,

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.840
we'll just do whatever

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.480
makes us happy.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.040
Right.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:52.920
That's the spirit.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.840
Just enjoy yourselves.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.520
If you get tired, come back here.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.520
This will always be your home.

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.120
What are you looking at? Give me a hug.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:06.640
Dear,

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.880
take care of yourself.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.080
You too.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.480
Come back when you're tired.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.440
Let me know you're okay.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.080
Sure.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.400
Should I step away?

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.679
Step away if you want.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.400
Let me lift you.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.400
You're too weak to lift me.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.199
I can't lift you.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.880
That's about it.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.679
Then let's start

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:43.719
with the recommendation letter.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.719
Let me ask again.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.280
About how much

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.159
does the whole process

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:52.480
you just talked about cost?

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.400
With living expenses and tuition,

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.600
it could easily be

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.400
over a million.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.160
But if the child

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.280
does well

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:03.880
and gets a scholarship

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.160
over there,

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.360
it might not cost much.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.000
I'm not really

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.200
counting on scholarships.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.400
As long as we can give her

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.440
the best resources

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.800
and conditions,

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.640
I'm willing to give everything I have.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.160
I'll accept whatever it costs.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.520
May I ask,

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.480
will you go with your child?

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.720
Of course.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.600
I'm all set to quit my job.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.600
Then the cost

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.680
might be about double

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.600
what I just mentioned.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:39.880
Mom,

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.320
maybe we should just forget it?

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.920
That's not for you to worry about.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:45.840
You just

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.320
focus on

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.640
studying hard.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.680
[If it really comes to it,]

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.840
[I'll sell the house.]

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.200
[I'll support you]

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:55.960
[no matter what.]

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.680
I know you and Dad

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.360
put a lot of effort

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.160
into raising me.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.800
You sent me abroad to study

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.360
and bought a house there.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.560
I just hope

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.920
you and Dad can have your own lives.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.560
And

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.800
don't...

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.000
You've always been sacrificing for me.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.360
And even now...

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.320
You've already

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.960
sold our house

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.400
in Canada, haven't you?

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.440
You made

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.360
such a big decision

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.720
on your own?

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.360
Yes, I did.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.960
Because I wanted you

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.920
to have a good living environment!

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.840
Stop living in other people's houses!

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.360
Mom!

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.440
Stop running around for me.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.760
Stop being obsessed

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.120
with this whole Canada thing.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.280
Let's all just take a breath.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.280
Stop struggling

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.280
in that whirlpool!

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.760
Alright, Mom?

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.040
I feel sad.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.000
And disappointed.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.000
I'm not sad or disappointed because

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.920
you couldn't make it

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.280
in Canada.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.720
Or because

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.040
you couldn't keep

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:11.840
that bank job.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.160
It's just that

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.760
I've raised you for so long,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.760
and you still

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.080
haven't learned

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.160
to face life

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:23.880
with optimism

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.000
and positivity.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.480
I was a teacher.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.840
I taught you countless times

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.080
how to take tests.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.960
But life

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.440
isn't solving a problem.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.440
There's...

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.360
There's no standard answer.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.360
I feel

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.680
pretty useless.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.040
Sometimes I think

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.480
it's a good thing I quit back then.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:55.920
Otherwise,

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.720
I'd just be misleading the students.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:01.880
Alright.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.800
Now you say

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.480
you want independence

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.000
and freedom.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.320
Then you need to

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.160
ask yourself clearly

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.280
if you're ready.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.840
What is independence?

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.960
What is freedom?

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.920
It means from now on,

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:21.880
no matter what happens

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.160
in life,

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.440
you have to

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.160
face it alone.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.120
I am

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.000
a first-time mom.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:38.720
Every day

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.360
I'm figuring things out as I go.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.440
I've felt a lot of helplessness

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.120
and confusion.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.240
Actually, with all that's happened

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.240
at home lately,

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:53.960
I think

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.960
it's been good in a way.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.200
It makes me feel like

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.200
these things

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.200
aren't such a big deal.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.960
It helps me take things easy.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.000
Sometimes

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:10.720
I secretly

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:12.840
observe your dad.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.480
No matter how bitter he feels inside,

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.120
he's always cheerful.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.040
Always forgiving.

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.120
He has a tender heart.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.360
I think

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.360
I should reflect on myself

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:36.800
and make some changes.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.400
I feel

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.200
quite guilty.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.120
I kept saying I wanted to

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.760
earn money to support the family

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.080
and pay for your education.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.720
But that's also a way

00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.600
of shirking responsibility.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.400
Whenever I faced

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.560
life's trivialities

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.160
or problems

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.520
I couldn't solve,

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.640
I thought

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.760
I should go to work.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.200
Because

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.560
compared to those unsolvable problems,

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.520
work felt like a break.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:18.800
Mainly,

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.920
besides work, I didn't know

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.280
what else I could do.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.440
I wanted so much to take care

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.200
of every detail

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.480
of your life.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:32.880
But

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.400
I missed

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.800
all your important moments.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:39.880
Including

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.960
when you needed me most.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.440
But fortunately,

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.840
you're not like me,

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.040
always going with the flow.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:52.840
Xinying,

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.560
new paths are hard.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.000
They'll be tough.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.040
But

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.120
there will also be a lot of joy.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.480
That's good.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:04.920
Take it slow.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.440
Dad.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.080
[Xinying,]

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.520
[by the time you hear]

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.120
[this voice message,]

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.880
[your mom and I will have already set off.]

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.080
[You've grown up.]

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.480
[Our mission is complete.]

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.440
[We used to think]

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.200
[you were everything in our lives.]

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.960
