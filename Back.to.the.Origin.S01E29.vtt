WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.320
This bottle of wine

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.200
is the one you brought last time.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.320
There's half left.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.720
Let's drink it today.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.440
Hey.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.560
It's fine.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.440
I can bring you more.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.880
Alright.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.880
Let's finish this first.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.960
Is this your first time

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.480
at the zoo since coming back?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.880
If you mean coming at night,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.520
that's a first in my life.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.840
Did you ever go to the zoo

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.840
when you were in Toronto?

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.320
No, not once.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.360
My mom was there with me.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.840
You know. I had no freedom.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.960
See it?

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.720
There's one.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.840
They're so cute.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.280
Cute, right?

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.920
Want me to be your guide today?

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.200
Sure.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.200
I... I need to use the bathroom.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.920
Let's go together then.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.360
Together, don't go alone.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.120
Look at you.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.880
Here, let me help you.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.920
Let's go.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.720
I need to check.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.280
I need to check. Let me see.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.839
Don't worry about the rest.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.399
Hurry, quick.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:19.440
Can't hold it much longer.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.600
Watch your step.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.640
I'm on duty.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.280
Watch your step. Let's go.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.120
Hey, look at you.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.800
Look at you.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.640
Wait for me.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.080
Take this.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.440
If they get close,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.760
just hold this out towards them.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.360
Slowly back away.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.040
What do you do

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.560
at the zoo?

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.760
I feel like all the animals

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.800
really like you.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.560
I'm a zoo tycoon.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.520
Night-shift cleaner.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.120
Did Fran tell you?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.320
Tell me what?

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.320
My parents got sentenced.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.800
A bit.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.240
Did Fran tell you

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.520
about my parents?

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.000
Yes.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.480
Said they went traveling in an RV.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.000
Fran is

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.720
such a gossip.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.680
Gotta thank him though.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.440
Let's thank Fran.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.680
Look at that one.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.520
It's coming over.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.880
Coming over.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.680
Here it comes.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.159
Look at you, are you drunk?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.720
Hey.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.680
No, just perking myself up.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.400
You took so long.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.400
I thought you fell in.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.920
You rascal, just you wait.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.440
When you get old,

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.320
you might

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.680
take longer to pee than I do.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.040
I don't know why,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.640
but we can't get in today.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.240
We could a few days ago.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.800
Would you like to see

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.760
any other animals?

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.640
How about pandas?

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.160
Any other national treasures would do.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.040
We can't get in there.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.640
They won't pay attention to us.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.680
They go to sleep

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.400
right after closing time.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.560
You danced really well, really.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.120
Okay?

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.800
Absolutely.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.360
Is it good?

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:45.840
Very.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.480
I danced all the time when I was young.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.480
I can tell.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.600
Dance like crazy.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.520
Alright.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.400
Catch your breath.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.840
Catch your breath.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.080
I... I'll go scout

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.600
outside.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.000
Don't want any trouble, okay?

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.640
Don't go.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.160
You can't do that.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.960
We haven't drunk properly yet.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.600
Sit still.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.800
I need to have a proper drink with you.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.760
You're not going anywhere.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.080
Fu.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.040
Do you have something on your mind?

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.440
I feel like

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.640
you're acting weird.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.080
No. I...

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:18.960
I just wanted to drink with you.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.280
Let's drink until we drop.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.520
Drink until we drop?

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.640
You must have something on your mind.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.960
You won't say, huh?

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.560
That's not it.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.040
Fine, then leave.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.240
I'm going to sleep right now.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:30.840
Get out.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.880
Hey, no. Please.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.600
I'll tell you.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.480
I'll talk, alright?

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.559
I'll talk.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.480
You definitely have sharp eyes.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.640
You saw right through me.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.200
I'm an open book to you.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.240
I'll talk.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.080
I'm a bit sad today.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.480
I broke up.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.440
See?

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.960
What did I say?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.000
I knew you came here

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.800
with something on your mind.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.000
Whatever it is, tell me.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.720
I'll help you sort it out.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.240
Alright?

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.040
Easy does it. Thank you.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.320
The first time I came here,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.600
it reminded me

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.600
of Canada's Wonderland.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.800
There's a similar pumpkin cart here.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.680
Just a different color.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.400
Don't you think life is amazing?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.640
So many places

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.960
feel familiar.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.120
I've only seen pictures

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.760
of Wonderland online.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.640
Never been there.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.640
You haven't been?

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.960
Then today, I'll show you

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.320
a not-so-wonderful Wonderland.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.720
Well, I have a girlfriend.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.320
It's been a little while.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.280
But today

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.960
I found out she...

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.640
For the past six months, I've given her

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.000
everything she wanted.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.640
Seatbelt.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.040
I always see people riding this

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.080
during the day when I'm cleaning.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.680
It only runs during the day.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.360
This is my first time too.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.360
From this high-altitude bike,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.640
you can see

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.920
the whole park.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.040
You can see the animals during the day.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.760
At night, you can even hear

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.640
them calling.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.640
I heard it.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.680
What animal

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.800
was calling over there just now?

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.640
Probably a peacock.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.040
Peacocks can make sounds?

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.240
My grandma said animals are simpler.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.080
So working at the zoo

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:51.760
is pretty good for me.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.240
I have animals around me.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.440
But now you don't just

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.120
have animals,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.040
you also have friends.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.080
Like Fran.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.880
Like me.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.720
We're all your friends.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.440
Did I wake you?

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.480
No, I just fell asleep.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.760
Great news.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.880
What good news?

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.320
I found a school for Nian.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.960
This school has

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.240
its own horse ranch

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.440
and

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.160
golf training area.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.800
It even offers ski training.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.000
Don't you love skiing

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.120
and golf?

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.000
Oh, great.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.960
Now I'm the one falling behind.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.160
I need to catch up with you two.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.040
Why do you seem

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040
a bit upset?

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.400
Daoqi,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.920
I thought we were on the same page

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.080
about the child's education.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.960
We already discussed this.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.000
And then you suddenly tell me this.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.840
You should've discussed it with me.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.960
I am discussing it with you.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.960
You were worried the public school's

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.440
teaching resources were limited

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.680
and afraid Nian

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.240
wouldn't get the proper attention.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:24.960
Look.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.160
This school

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.360
has one teacher for every two students.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.560
And every teacher

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.400
is qualified to work with

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.200
special needs children like Nian.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.800
You can completely

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.200
trust them with him.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.480
Daoqi, Nian is my child.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.720
I know best what he needs

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.320
and what's best for him.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.280
You didn't even give me a heads-up.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.560
This is a bit reckless.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.880
Nian is your child,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.320
and he's my child too.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.120
I wouldn't hurt him.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.600
And you know what?

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.480
This is the best private school

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.400
in Lucheng City.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.240
You can't get in just with money.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.640
They screen the parents.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.240
I specifically asked Xing Kai to help,

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.160
then he asked a friend,

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.440
and we went through more connections

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.319
just to get this one spot.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.599
How is that reckless?

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.160
You know Nian's situation

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.720
is special.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.359
He could be bullied.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.880
What he needs most is

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.600
family life

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.600
with his parents.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.880
And for you, as his dad,

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.080
you should spend

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.640
more time with him.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.600
Did Nian tell you that?

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.320
What... What?

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.320
Are these

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.280
Nian's thoughts

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.400
or yours?

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.640
I know what you're anxious about.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.640
But you can't decide

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.080
how Nian's childhood

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.720
should be spent just because of

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.600
your excessive worry.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.680
Your thoughts

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.680
don't speak for him.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.560
Anyway, I've already paid the deposit.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.880
What is this?

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.280
This is a horse ranch, see?

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.800
And what's this?

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.480
This is the golf training center.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.320
What is this?

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.880
This is an indoor ski slope.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.400
And this?

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.160
This is the cafeteria.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.960
Look, it says so right there.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.560
See?

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.840
Then what's this?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.280
This is the library.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.440
Look, is it big?

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.360
Big.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.680
All of this area is part of the library.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.320
Look over here. What's this?

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.760
What's this?

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.120
This is the big playground.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.360
And what's this?

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.120
This is called the staff center.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.120
Then what's this over here?

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.360
This is the interest...

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.520
Okay.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.160
Nian, I'm heading to work.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.040
Listen to your mom, alright?

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:26.640
Be good.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.160
I'm leaving.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.640
I'm off to work.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.040
Nian, sit.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.200
Time for breakfast.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.200
No more watching this.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.800
Right this way, please.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.680
Take it easy, don't run!

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.360
This is our

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.120
teaching building.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.720
It has four floors in total.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.520
On this side we have classrooms,

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.920
a dining area, and a media room.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.840
Over here are some

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.120
students' works for appreciation,

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.280
along with memorable moments.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.560
Apart from this,

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.400
we also have

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.960
a multi-purpose playground,

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.160
a children's swimming pool,

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.280
and a mini golf course at the back.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.200
Up front is

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.320
the Lemon Class I mentioned.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.640
Lemon Class is the designed class

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.400
for children with special needs.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.600
It's perfect for children

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.320
like yours.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.600
They're having a study session.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.600
We can go take a look.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.680
This is the Lemon Class.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.760
The teacher-to-student ratio here

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.440
is one to two,

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.800
which is quite high.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.120
All the teaching resources,

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.080
curriculum, and after-school programs

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:12.920
for Lemon Class

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.400
are specially designed.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.920
So these children are separated

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.120
from the others?

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.760
Children like yours

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.200
have different needs

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.000
from typical ones.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.000
Lemons may be sour,

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.480
but they're really nutritious.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.760
It's all about

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.640
how you put them to use.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.920
Ms. Xue.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:56.920
It's fine.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.640
Sorry about that.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.320
This student's still receiving guidance.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.480
Let's go take a break over there.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.240
Okay.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.280
It's alright. Don't be scared.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.080
Mom's right here.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:11.640
Lemon Class

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.640
is really popular.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.400
We just

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.520
had a student transfer out,

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.520
so one spot opened up.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.320
And you were referred by Mr. Wang.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.120
Li Nian's dad has already paid

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.000
the deposit.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.600
You just need to fill out

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.680
the registration form.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.120
Can I ask something?

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.120
You just said

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.600
a child transferred out.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.520
Where did he go?

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.760
I'm sorry.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.000
That's private student info.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.080
I can't really tell you that.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.480
You're back so early today?

00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.720
Have you eaten?

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.640
Let me fix you something.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.760
What do you want?

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.040
What's wrong?

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.040
I just got a call from the school.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.480
They said you took Nian there today.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.640
But you didn't register him,

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:16.880
and you had them

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.280
refund the deposit instead.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:25.960
Calm down.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.320
Let's not get mad in front of the child.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.280
Sit down.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.280
I'll explain it to you.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.080
We did go to

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:37.920
the school today.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.360
But that Lemon Class

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.960
is for special needs children.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.240
I was worried Nian would get labeled

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.760
if he attended.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.880
When I suggested sending him

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.200
to a public school...

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.520
Keep your voice down.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.600
When I suggested sending him

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.440
to a public school,

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.080
you said he needed special care

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.400
and were afraid he'd be bullied.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.360
Now I found the best private school

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.280
in Lucheng City,

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.080
and this class

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.000
is specifically for children

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.320
like him.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.080
And you're worried he might get labeled.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.640
He's at the age

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.040
to go to school now.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.480
But he stays home

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.920
every single day.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.360
I really don't know

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.200
if you even want him

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.480
to have a normal life.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.160
Are you finished?

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.560
Can I speak now?

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.240
No.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.960
I don't want to hear you today.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.160
In this house,

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.000
whatever I say,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.280
we end up doing things your way anyway.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.160
From now on, just listen to your mom.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.560
[Zhang Ran, your team's topics]

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.640
[are all buzzworthy.]

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.720
[During the actual show,]

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.840
[you have to maintain]

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.920
[this style.]

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.280
[Anran,]

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:18.960
[same for you.]

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.360
[Just relax and open up,]

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:20.880
[alright?]

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.600
Got it, director.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.600
Don't worry.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.080
We'll go all out

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.800
to collaborate for the show's success.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.160
Director, I'll also do my best

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.640
to work with Anran.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.760
[Good. I have very high hopes]

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.640
[for your duo.]

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.440
[Let's all work together]

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.560
[to turn this little hit]

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.080
[into a major one.]

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.920
The theme for today's debate

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.480
is "Lie Flat or Grind".

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.880
So, which side are you guys

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.600
leaning toward?

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.600
Alright, I'll go first.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.720
I really love

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.920
this episode's theme.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.920
To be honest, in our industry,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.080
if you can't grind, you're done.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.600
But I've been exhausted these years.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.000
I feel like I'm burning out.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.240
So I'd like to choose

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.560
the pro side. Is that okay?

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:09.680
Don't you want to

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.800
challenge yourself?

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.520
[Breaking out]

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.560
[of your usual persona]

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.360
[might get you more attention.]

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.840
Director,

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.760
I think for the first episode,

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.840
it'd be easier for the audience

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.880
to accept

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.560
if we stick to what they expect.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.520
I agree

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.640
with Anran.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.160
I think going all-in on the grind

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.240
is a solid choice.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.040
[Alright.]

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.520
[I get your points.]

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.080
[We'll]

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.560
[refine the show's flow]

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.480
[and discuss more later.]

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:38.920
Okay. No problem.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.120
Bye, sir.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:40.720
[Okay.]

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.720
[We'll wrap up here today. Bye.]

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.320
Alright. Thanks, sir.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.120
Appreciate your work, sir.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:43.920
Thanks for your effort, sir.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.200
That's it then.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.120
Meeting's over, then.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.480
Alright. We'll get back to work.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.760
Okay. Everyone, go get ready.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.160
Aren't you leaving?

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.040
I have another meeting to attend.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.000
Okay. We're heading out then.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:57.680
Okay.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.560
Xiaohe.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.800
Gather our team

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:03.680
for a meeting.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:04.840
Look, Ran.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:05.800
No matter how you put it,

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.120
choosing "grind" will get you flak.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.840
So what?

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.560
It won't hurt.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.800
Besides, the more...

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.440
Unconventional the move.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.400
Right. The more...

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:15.800
surprising the outcome.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.360
Exactly.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.840
Okay. Just remember to speak slower.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.160
Alright.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.560
This episode must be a success.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.040
No room for failure.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.800
For the next two days, everyone

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.920
needs to do serious preparation.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.320
Sort through

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.040
all the videos,

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.080
articles,

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.200
and any other materials

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.560
related to "lie flat" or "grind".

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.560
I will have three speeches.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.240
Each one needs

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.000
a killer quote.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.520
Something that'll go viral.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.880
Every minute must have a punchline.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.360
Anran, when you say punchline,

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.680
do you mean like stand-up style?

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.920
Any kind of punchline is fine,

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.680
as long as it sparks conversation

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.000
and gets people talking.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:07.800
We all know

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.520
this show

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.640
uses audience voting.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.200
So what do we have to do?

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.280
We have to win!

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.720
Don't you guys want to win?

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.080
Win!

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.840
What are you clapping for?

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.080
We haven't even won yet.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:29.760
Any other questions?

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.000
Anran,

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.760
the TCM appointment is coming up.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Should I call a ride now?

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.160
Let's go.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.520
Go for it.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.480
Come on!

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.760
We have to win!

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.560
Come on, guys.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.720
Grinding like crazy

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.400
but still talking about self-acceptance?

00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.720
I give up. I'm lying flat.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.280
I want to lie flat too.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.440
Who would grind if they could lie flat?

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.320
Then why do we grind?

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.840
Simple. We have no choice.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.320
I wish I could

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.120
spill coffee

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.560
on someone's shirt

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.840
and have them say,

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.120
"Sweetheart,

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.520
you've caught my attention."

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.000
"Here's my card. "

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.480
"Spend it however you like."

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.400
That's actually pretty cringe.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.440
Who wrote this?

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.680
It's disgusting.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.240
The values are all wrong.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.160
Why are you still up so late?

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.200
I'm exhausted.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.680
I'm working

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.600
on my speech.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:53.840
I'm going to bed.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.280
Gotta get up early tomorrow.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:01.840
[No.]

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.720
[I think it's good.]

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.800
[Or you could ask Yudong?]

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.280
[He can represent the audience.]

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.720
I'm asleep. Stop talking.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:11.960
Good night.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:14.840
Let's go.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:21.760
Hello, Cheng Man.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.600
[It's Zhang Ran.]

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.680
[Sorry to bother you.]

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.480
[I... I really]

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.880
[have no one else to discuss this with.]

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.000
About that talk show

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.200
you helped me with,

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.360
we're recording the first episode today.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.840
I have a segment in it

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.560
and I'm not sure

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.920
if what I'm saying will work

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.760
or if it might cause issues.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:43.920
[So I want]

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.840
[your advice on it.]

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.280
Alright. Tell me what you've got.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.680
Okay. Here goes.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.280
The theme of our talk is

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.480
about how to live life.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.720
Should we lie flat or should we grind?

00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.000
[I've been thinking a lot]

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.280
[about how to approach this episode.]

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.600
[Honestly, I'm quite conflicted.]

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.200
[In the end, I decided to]

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.480
[use people around me as examples.]

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:05.880
[Like how Yudong and Daoqi changed]

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.160
[after starting their own business.]

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.520
Look at Fu Yudong.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.480
Before, he'd do

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.640
whatever I told him.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.720
Now he's a completely different person.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.720
Let me introduce

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.760
a new friend.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.640
His surname is Fu. An academic.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.600
He's never done manual work.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.760
Please go easy on him.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.120
Mr. Zhu, should he help you

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.480
lay the flooring this afternoon?

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.680
Looking forward to working with you all.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.640
Never done decoration work before?

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.240
Just arrived from China?

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:31.840
No.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.400
I studied here.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.480
I just graduated.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.920
Haven't found

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.720
the right job yet.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.960
So I'm just here for now

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:40.880
to make some money

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.520
and get by.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.160
A hundred. A hundred fifty.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.280
How about we make it three-eighty?

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.080
We're family, you know.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.000
If you ask me,

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.040
not getting into that pharma company

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.440
isn't something to regret.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:58.960
Really.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.760
Staying here

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.600
and working with us

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.760
is pretty good, isn't it?

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.520
My wife says she

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.240
can't accept it.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.680
And

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.560
she wants to come back and try.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.720
Since that's what she wants,

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.240
I have to come back with her.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.520
If it doesn't work out, I can always

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.520
go back to my old line of work.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.080
Yudong is a Ph.D.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.280
from a top university, after all.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.440
I think it's a waste of talent for him

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.720
to be a decorator abroad.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.440
Look how coincidental this is.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.560
See who's here with me.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.400
Can you see?

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.480
Let me get you some water.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.440
No, thanks.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.960
Zhang Ran

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.720
has a clear idea

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.000
of what she wants to do.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.600
But I

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.480
haven't quite figured mine out yet.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.480
So it's a temporary thing for now.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.720
See, I knew it.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.880
You have a PhD, after all.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.640
You couldn't have come back

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.640
just to do this.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.360
Sir, close the door.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.960
The smell's drifting into the living room.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.920
How can we eat with that stench?

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.880
[Sir, please]

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.520
[take the trash out.]

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.600
[And close the door too.]

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:06.960
Fu Yudong.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:09.520
What are you doing?

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.400
Nothing. Just watching a video.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.000
[Yudong,]

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:23.880
[meet me at the cafe]

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.480
[downstairs from your place in 20 minutes.]

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.120
Take your time.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.400
I haven't paid any attention

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.400
to the skincare niche.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.400
I don't even know

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.560
what all those face creams

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.360
are for.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.760
You have a Ph.D.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.800
from Royal University of Toronto.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.480
You just need to help me

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.679
figure out

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.000
all the chemistry stuff,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
the molecules

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.840
or whatever.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.280
Yeah, but...

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.760
Yudong, let me ask you something.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.480
You came back to work on your career,

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:47.679
right?

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:49.239
You've sent out so many resumes.

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:51.520
Did you get a single job offer

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.280
you actually wanted,

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.239
and that Zhang Ran

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:53.960
was happy with?

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.000
Did you?

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.560
Why are you scratching it?

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.960
It itches. There's fluff.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.200
Hold on a bit longer.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.520
Just keep holding. Good job.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.560
Hands in your pockets.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.080
In your pants pockets, man.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.000
In your pockets.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:18.640
Watch me.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.320
Let me think.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.480
What should I make?

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.520
Got it.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.320
Do I look like a Ph.D.?

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.200
Li Daoqi taught me.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.600
I think

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.360
you were great.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.240
Just charging ahead.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.320
Always pushing forward.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.560
You're an internet celebrity now.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.680
But why have you become

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:35.920
so timid and nervous

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.120
all of a sudden?

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:39.760
I can totally do this.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.560
I won't give up.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.000
Just keep pushing forward. It's fine.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:46.800
Come on.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.880
Let's have a taste of success.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.480
I think it's really hard for you.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.400
If it gets too much, just quit.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.040
I'll take care of you.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.240
I have

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.800
my own career now. Don't laugh.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.760
I'm serious.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:03.640
So

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.040
for both Yudong and Li Daoqi,

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.640
grinding is the necessary path

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.480
to success.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.000
I watched their livestream.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.360
It was a huge success.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.040
They've really been transformed.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:14.760
[What do you think?]

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.240
Then let me tell you

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.800
their startup story.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.960
From my personal perspective,

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.040
I'll share how I feel.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.440
Watch out.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.200
Be careful. There are steps.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.400
Steps.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.840
Lift your leg.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.200
Yes. Come on.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:34.760
Move forward.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.160
Alright?

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.480
He had too much to drink today.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.480
Sorry.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.000
It's fine.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.360
Don't say that.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.280
I couldn't stop him.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.560
It's already a big help

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.520
that you brought him back.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.960
[So, the feeling of needing to]

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.680
[drink water]

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.360
[and use the bathroom is a kind of...]

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.760
Look who's back.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.120
Honestly, I feel terrible right now.

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.160
But I'm still happy

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.360
to tell you

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.920
I brought back a great bottle of wine.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.480
Daoqi, look what time it is now.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.600
What time is it? Tell me.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.520
It's past 1 AM. Keep your voice down.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.400
Don't wake...

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.760
Don't wake the child.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.360
It's past 1 AM, so we need to be quiet.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.000
Can't wake the baby.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.840
Daoqi.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.280
Can you try to

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.600
come back earlier next time?

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.680
How much did you drink?

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.400
We landed

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.600
Lady Wan today.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.160
You should have seen the looks

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.360
Xing Kai and Michael gave us.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.240
Finally hold our heads high.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.600
So good.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.080
Believe me, Man.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.920
One day,

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.120
I will

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.880
become the man

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.800
you truly...

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.480
I believe you.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.800
Yudong, we used to be like

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.560
these two decorations by the door.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.800
Now we're

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.480
these two big pincers. Seriously.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.480
Charging through everything.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.280
Raking it in.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.800
Raking it in.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.760
Come here. Let's go.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.520
Aren't you taking me home?

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.120
Come home with me. Let's go.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.120
We're going back to the ocean.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.000
Are you crazy?

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.200
We're going back to the ocean.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.440
If I strike it rich,

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.320
I'll make a film

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.560
about our

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:42.880
startup story.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.720
[Li Daoqi's entrepreneurial efforts]

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.440
[sound romantic.]

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.240
[But to support]

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.240
[his venture,]

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.600
[our whole family]

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.120
[is making sacrifices.]

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.360
[I don't agree with you,]

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.560
[but I respect your choice.]

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:37.760
Ran.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:39.400
Time for makeup.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:40.760
Let's go.
