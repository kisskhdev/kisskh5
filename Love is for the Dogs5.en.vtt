00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.650
Kai, it's been a while.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.590
- Who is he?
- Yuka, how have you ãƒ¼

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.880
Could you be Mr. Woo So Ha?

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.760
- Yes, I am.
- I knew it.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.680
Nice to meet you. I'm Gaku Sagara.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.710
I manage an animal clinic in Setagaya,
and am involved in various entrepreneurial activities.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.860
I once attended an international venture seminar
organized by WooRoA Group.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.630
- Hey.
- Seminar? Where?

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.650
At Watt Hotel in Singapore.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.490
I remember you were at the party with a pretty model.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.610
- Really?
- Hey.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.710
What brings you here?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.780
Long time no see. I'm glad to see you're both doing great.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.280
What a wonderful clinic you've got here!

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.040
Feels homely and well-equipped. It's so like you, Kai.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.320
Is he really a vet?

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.280
He gives off a more salesman vibe.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.680
I happened to be in the area, so figured I'd drop by to say hi.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.430
Liar.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.600
I can never fool you, Yuka.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.440
I actually came to speak with you.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.550
It's nothing bad, if that's what you're thinking.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.970
[WooRoA]

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.980
Right. I'm counting on you.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.970
You heard what he said. We're counting on you, Ms. Hanamura.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.630
I'm sorry, my meeting with the new client overran,
so I missed part of this meeting's discussion.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.340
In short...

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.850
Mr. So Ha's brother, So Jin, wants the dog back.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.710
He will be the dog's new owner.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.870
I presume he would naturally inherit the 50 billion won then.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.230
Their mother is also worried about Mr. So Ha,
and wishes to know how he is doing.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.250
So we will be providing them "intel".

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.590
Providing intel?

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.270
While you report on Mr. So Ha's well-being,
Mr. So Jin hopes to get info he can use as leverage.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.840
This includes any slip-ups that Mr. So Ha would make.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.310
To be honest, if we could get any intel of Kai Shirosaki

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.100
or Mr. So Ha mistreating the dog,
it would surely speed things up.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.010
As a lawyer, doing such spy-related things is not in my...

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.780
Mr. So Ha is still part of the WooRoA Group.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.140
And they are only trying to get their dog back,
so I wouldn't call this a conflict of interest.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.360
- But, sir...
- That is our client's request.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.470
If you can't do it, we can look for someone else who can.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.720
But you know them both well.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.510
So if you take on this task,
things can be settled more peacefully.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.430
I'm counting on you, Ms. Hanamura.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.980
Yes, sir.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.640
So adorable...

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.070
Hello there.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.350
On top of managing a clinic, I recently collaborated
with pet care supplier "Pet Fides"

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.840
to develop pet care products. I supervise an app
that manages pets' weight and health as well.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.230
I've also partnered with an IT company...

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.930
to help establish a medical treatment system for pets.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.400
- I see.
- Who are you saying all this to?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.930
Thanks to these ventures, I'm able to provide funding.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.440
In other words, I'll donate towards that shelter's renovation.
[Sincere Home Animal Shelter]

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.040
Hi there.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.150
That man is...

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.870
Apparently, he was Mr. Kai and Ms. Yuka's friend back in school.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.810
This stuff...

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.820
I don't need them.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.280
Just between us, I see tension between them.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.310
How much were you planning to donate?

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.350
The full amount.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.050
You'll really help save these animals?

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.190
Of course. In exchange for that, Kai...

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.040
I ask that you sell Shirosaki Animal Hospital to me.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.280
[Episode 5]

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.480
You want me to sell my clinic?

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.450
Don't get mad at me just yet.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.260
Just put aside your past grudges for now and let me explain.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.250
I'm currently looking to open a hospital branch.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.950
But to find the location, facilities and manpower from scratch,
is costly and inefficient.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.000
If we form a partnership together,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.580
your business will become stable,
and these animals can be saved.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.690
You're asking me this, after you betrayed us like that?

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.330
He betrayed you? What happened?

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.200
We agreed to open a clinic together after we graduated.
Preparations were well underway.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.080
Except one day, he suddenly vanished.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.040
Together with our pooled funds and the staff we recruited.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.270
Back then, the opportunity for my current clinic
suddenly came up.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.010
That's why I'm hoping to make amends this time.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.940
I'm really sorry for what I did.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.700
That wasn't all.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.000
'Sup!

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.940
Mr. Shirosaki, Mrs. Suzumori will be arriving soon with Fuku.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.420
That animal hospital is everything to me.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.800
I'm not giving it up to anyone.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.810
I'm declining your offer.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.990
Maybe it's me, but the mood here feels tense.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.570
I guess I rubbed him the wrong way.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.120
This is hard.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.040
You brought all this upon yourself.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.730
I have to go.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.850
But I'll drop by again.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.350
I want to help these furkids.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.430
That guy came by our clinic earlier.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.960
He's Ms. Yuka's ex. Things were complicated between them.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.880
I see... Wait, he's her ex?

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.900
That Olu'Olu Clinic's director wants to buy over our hospital?

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.530
Whoa, he's really famous.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.350
Where did you find that info?

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.480
His clinic looks stylish.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.500
He's only pretending to be cool.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.360
"'Olu'Olu', means 'kind', 'comfortable', and 'friendly' in Hawaiian".

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.710
What a hypocrite. He really sucks at choosing names.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.330
Anyway, he did approach me, but I rejected him.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.440
I'll go prep for the surgery.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.640
That's rare.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.660
Mr. Shirosaki is usually easy-going and goofy.
Now he's openly declaring rivalry.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.180
So the rumor is true.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.520
- It must be.
- What rumor? Tell me.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:06.300
Apparently, Mr. Shirosaki used to like Ms. Yuka,
but his friend stole her from him.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.880
- Who did you hear that from?
- From the manager of the pet goods store at the station.

The pet goods store manager?

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:17.000
More specifically, she heard it from
a fellow dog-lover friend.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.140
- Dog-lover friend?
- That friend's brother's wife's friend's older sister's classmate,

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.210
- I don't get it anymore.
- was Ms. Yuka's classmate. Here, let me explain.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.550
- This is Ms. Yuka...
- What's that?

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.710
- And this is the store manager.
- Okay, that's Ms. Yuka...

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.570
- Everyone...
- Then this is the dog-lover friend.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.710
- Everyone!
- Yes?

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.800
- What?
- Mrs. Suzumori has arrived.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.240
- Fuku's owner, right?
- The surgery room has been prepped.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.920
- Back to the topic...
- So that's the sister's classmate...

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.960
- One more thing!
- Yes?

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.550
Now what?

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.350
- She said she found them.
- Found what?

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.640
- By who?
- Did what?

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:56.520
- They were abandoned?
- Yes, maybe someone heard we were a family of cat-lovers.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.290
These poor things. They were left in front of my house.

[Sincere Home Animal Shelter]

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:26.300
Ms. Yuka, is it true that he's your ex?

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.900
Beats me. I have too many exes to count.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.550
Huh?

Sorry, I was kidding.

- Why?
- Why...

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.220
Because it was snowing.

The pet grooming school I went to,
was near the vet college that Kai and Sagara were at.

We did our research and volunteer activities together.

That day, Afro, my pet chihuahua of 16 years passed away,

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.800
and I needed someone to talk to.

At that time, he was there for me.

He saved me from despair, and maybe that's how it started.

What if Kai was the one there that day?

That's right. If Mr. Shirosaki had been there,
you two would have...

I'm not sure about that.

But the three of us were close back then.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.270
That's right.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.970
If there's anything on your mind, just tell me.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.300
Try your best.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.840
- This is the flyer for our cafe.
- Thank you.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.710
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.580
There's something in your hair.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.660
[Ken Kusakabe: How's the investigation getting along?]

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.290
- So Ha! Perfect! This is for you.
- Hi, Mrs. Tamayo.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.720
A watermelon?

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.710
A thank-you gift. I had an extra one.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.770
It's really heavy.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.670
- Thank you for the watermelon.
- It's big, so it's surely sweet.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.220
Thank you.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.910
Right?

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.720
Kai!

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.070
Why do you have a watermelon?

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.600
Mrs. Suzumori gave it to me.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.290
She gave me one, too.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.400
We'll make watermelon juice later then. But first, make dinner.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.230
Napolitan for today, okay?

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.020
Really?

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.870
Why am I the one cooking again today?

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.530
Sounds delicious.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:43.500
So Ha, when are you planning to move out of here?

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.920
After I get 50 billion won.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.260
Say what?

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.360
I have to admit, it looks good.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.710
I guess it's not bad.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.500
- Bon appÃ©tit.
- Digging in.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:11.230
What did you mean by "after you get 50 billion won"?

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.860
There's probably going to be a meeting
about the inheritance soon.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.590
And since I'm with Shogun for now,

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.160
Yeon Su is trying to justify
that I have the right to the inheritance.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.700
So you're basically waiting to get the money?

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.310
I'll take whatever I can get.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:30.100
And after that, I'll help you out.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.570
Huh?

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.520
The animal shelter.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:39.000
I'm a more dependable person than that traitor.
[Sincere Home Animal Shelter]

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.590
I didn't ask for your help.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.370
I don't want to be indebted to anyone.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.190
I'll reach my goal on my own.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.890
Stop pretending to be cool.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.080
You're getting more and more cats. What are you gonna do?

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.100
We're currently looking for fosterers.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.990
You can't save them if you don't have money.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.210
That's something a rich young master like you would say.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.170
- I'm a pauper right now.
- That's nothing to brag about.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:18.120
Let's be honest. What that Sagara guy said is right.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.640
To get money to save those animals,

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.230
you have to come to a compromise.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:29.680
If I sell everything just for the money,
I'll only end up losing myself.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.780
As a vet, this is something I cannot accept.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.940
Why are you so stubborn?

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:37.060
If you want to complain, by all means, please leave this house.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:50.180
Look here. This is Aiko, and this is Yuka.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.830
- Whose house should I go to?
- What?

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.460
If you drive me out of here,

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.820
I'm sure either of them will take me in.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.480
Whose house would you hate for me to go to?

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:17.560
If both of them love you, who would you choose?

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.050
I'll ask Yuka...

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.470
Yuka's ex-classmate to help look for fosterers.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.980
- Kai...
- I'm not interested.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.320
- What?
- I'm not interested in either of them.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.120
Surprisingly, it tastes better with the seaweed.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.610
You're way too oblivious.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.750
You're right.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:16.210
It's not in my place to worry about others.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.510
Is this your way of being considerate of others?

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:37.970
But over here, you're So Ha.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.040
You're just So Ha, the man with no money

or roof above his head.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.250
In other words, you're free.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.040
Nah, I'm not in love with her or anything.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.560
I'm just feeling glad.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.670
Shogun, come here.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.020
Come, you adorable fluff ball.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.360
What should I do?

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.560
I can't believe I gathered all this intel on him.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:03.580
What you're doing feels like a fan chasing after her idol.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.110
Or worse, I'm like a stalker.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.560
Thank you for a job well done.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.280
A job...

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.050
The chief asked me this the other day.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:21.310
"Ms. Hanamura, what kind of lawyer do you want to become?"

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.830
The usual stuff, right?

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.010
"One, a lawyer who makes money".

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.870
"Two, a lawyer who helps people".

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.320
"Which will you choose to become?"

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.040
Of course I'd choose both.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.770
But is this really a job that helps people?

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:48.430
Ms. Hanamura, why did you want to become a lawyer?

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.410
I wanted to help my mother.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.000
Your mother?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.780
There are people like my mother whose marriages are broken,

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.580
but can't fight back because they have family responsibilities.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.410
In such cases, it's hard to get a divorce.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:10.660
Things like compensation, splitting of assets,
child custody, parental rights...

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:19.290
They're all complicated issues rolled up
into a ball of tangled yarn, and I wanted to untangle them.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:23.620
I see. That's why you handle those divorce cases.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:29.320
But now here I am, trying to find dirt on others...

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.490
On my chingu.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:35.660
Chingu?

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.940
Friend. Selling out my friend like this

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.510
is honestly something I don't want to do.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.580
Isn't that precisely why it's called a "job"?

00:21:53.580 --> 00:22:00.420
You have to do the work even though you don't want to.
That's why it's a job.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.610
Which is exactly why you shouldn't just focus on your job.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:11.980
You should go out there and find something
that makes you happy.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.450
In my case, I take a variety of lessons five times a week.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:19.830
- Five times a week?
- That's right. I take Spanish,

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:27.820
pilates, postcard-drawing, baking, and crocheting classes.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.550
Cats...

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.370
Cats?

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.780
What is it? Wanna come live with me?

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.260
If you don't mind, I'd like to keep it.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.510
Well, well. Now they all have families.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:56.160
I'm glad our last one found its forever home.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.490
Ms. Hanamura, thank you very much.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.590
No, I didn't do anything.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:02.250
Thank you for introducing your friend to us.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.660
No problem at all. I'm happy for them too.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:11.850
Pets can understand when you talk to them like this.
They can sense how their owner is feeling.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:18.750
When their owner is happy, they rejoice together.
When their owner is sad, they comfort them.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.510
I'm sure they'll become inseparable.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.000
And I'm speaking from experience.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.550
Kai, the kittens have safely reached their new homes.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.940
Great. Was there anything else they needed?

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.820
Can I take a look just in case?

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:57.030
My senior took in two cats at one go,
so I figured I'd give these as thank-you gifts.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.010
Thanks. I appreciate it.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.010
- Don't worry, I'll get them.
- So sorry.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:16.250
You're as dynamic as ever.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.720
To put it nicely, you're super proactive.
To put it bluntly, you're careless.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.590
Careless? Me?

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.070
It's especially obvious when you go to put away dishes.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.190
Really?

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:38.400
And when you couldn't cut an apple into a rabbit,
you peeled it bare, too.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.280
Not to mention that time you didn't bring an umbrella
when it snowed.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.420
When it snowed?

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:49.190
Yup. You came to campus on a snowy day once, remember?

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:55.720
I heard that your dog died, and you ran out of your home.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.970
I went to look for you.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.160
But I never managed to find you.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.370
Those were the days.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.250
You need a bag for those, right?

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.620
Wait, Kai.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.940
I'll be right there. Hang on.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.900
Ms. Yuka, here's a bag.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.580
Thanks.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.770
You see...

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.930
I'm not good at reading the room, so let me say this.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.000
Will you go out with me?

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.230
Yeah, sure.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.100
Huh?

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.830
I'm going back now. See you.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.620
What's going on?

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.430
Yup.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.920
- The date has been decided, so I rushed back to inform you.
- What date?

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.730
It's the day they'll finally decide what to do
with the dog and the money.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:58.670
The day we'll know what happens to the 50 billion won.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:12.000
Sir, your four o' clock.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.650
I know. Act like we didn't see her.

[Report - Guidelines for keeping dog (Shogun)]

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.120
You should slowly savor your food.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.610
Sorry, sir. I wasn't aware I was rushing through my food.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.450
It was always my dream, you know?

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:58.630
To have my own office, and a place like this to rest and relax.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.780
I've benefitted from your generosity quite a bit, sir.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:11.020
I used to live in an old, cramped apartment,
and I was a poor law student who failed the bar exam.

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.700
I have come a long way.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.760
But we still have a long road ahead.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:58.640
Nice to meet you, Mr. Shirosaki.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:01.390
Nice to meet you.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.430
- Where's Dad?
- He's not coming. He said he'd leave this to us.

With that, let us begin our final negotiations
regarding the dog and inheritance.

As you all are aware, Mrs. Lee Mi Hee,
former WooRoA president and your grandmother, owned a dog.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:27.170
In her will, 50 billion won was offered
to whoever bore the burden of taking care of her dog, Rocky.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:32.110
This amounts to five billion Japanese yen.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:39.890
Currently, the dog is residing with Mr. So Ha,
who claims that he has ownership rights over the dog.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.430
However, his family has objections regarding this matter.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:45.560
Yes, we object to it.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:53.430
From the beginning, we have stated that we have the means
to take care of this 50-billion-won dog.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:57.290
But Woo So Ha has not made any contributions to the business,

00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:02.580
and continues to live his life wandering around
with nothing but a superficial title.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:07.420
At this point, we do not know whether he has been
really taking care of Rocky,

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:12.020
or what kind of agreement he has made
with Mr. Shirosaki behind our backs.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:18.330
If I may speak, in all honesty, I do not want the money.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.740
I only want to live with Shogun.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.780
Shogun is not a "50-billion-won dog".

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:30.850
He is my family.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.430
But what does Woo So Ha think?

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:47.390
Woo So Ha, can you really call this dog your family?

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.660
That is something that we have to confirm.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:55.790
And that is why we did a little investigation beforehand.

00:30:55.790 --> 00:31:02.280
I shall let Ms. Hanamura report on her findings.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.050
Ms. Hanamura?

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.150
So that's what it was.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:27.250
Ms. Hanamura, please proceed.

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:44.930
- What's this?
- Here are the results of my investigation.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:48.570
Because Mr. So Ha's family had cut off all financial support,

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:53.020
Mr. So Ha moved into Mr. Shirosaki's home,
and started working part-time at a cafe.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:32:00.060
As far as I know, Mr. Shirosaki is the one taking care of Shogun.

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:07.220
Based on my observation, they are not sharing
equal responsibility in caring for the dog.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.920
Which goes to say that the inheritance
should rightfully belong to ãƒ¼

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:19.800
However, I object to Shogun being returned to WooRoA.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:35.040
As far as I know,
the bond between Mr. Shirosaki and Shogun is real.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.750
Ms. Hanamura?

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:52.840
I can say without a doubt, that Shogun is happy right now.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.370
Ms. Hanamura...

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:13.730
And Mr. So Ha...

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.430
He is enjoying his life in Japan right now.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:47.640
Mr. So Ha is working hard at his job,
while living together with Shogun.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:59.000
Together with Mr. Shirosaki who is a vet,
he can adequately contribute in caring for Shogun.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.410
Therefore, I recommend Mr. So Ha
to be the one to care for Shogun.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:12.590
Enough, Ms. Hanamura. We get it already.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:18.360
However, if the heirs present here agree,

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.050
I recommend that the dog's ownership rights and inheritance
be considered separately.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:27.950
The 50 billion won will go to the WooRoA Group,
while the dog will remain with Mr. So Ha.

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:35.520
And Mr. So Ha will care for the dog, together with Mr. Shirosaki.

00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:39.360
What do you all think of this arrangement?

00:34:55.750 --> 00:35:01.230
If you would allow me to take care of Shogun,

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:08.440
I promise to cherish him for the rest of my life,

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.800
on behalf of your grandmother.

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:28.520
I understand.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.940
We will give up the dog.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.210
We shall proceed with this arrangement.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:41.310
But I will have to speak with my father about the next steps.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:56.040
Hang on a second.
Does this mean that my only inheritance is Shogun,

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:01.670
and nothing else?

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:05.990
Rather than not getting anything,
you've gained something priceless, don't you think?

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:10.470
People who understand you.

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.760
I am very sorry, Chief.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:54.230
I apologize if what I said earlier
didn't go according to what you wished for.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:56.810
This is the conclusion that I came to after I investigated ãƒ¼

00:36:56.810 --> 00:37:00.410
I guess I was wrong.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:01.910
Sir?

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:07.320
You don't have plans to aim higher.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.150
Aiko.

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:44.400
Thanks to you, I've lost all my money.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.650
Hey, watch your words.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:50.500
So I'd say...

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.610
Let's all give it a ride.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:56.210
Ride?

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:59.000
Ride what?

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:06.370
We're taking it on one last spin. Let's make it count!

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.660
We're back, Shogun.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.800
Sorry to come here empty-handed.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.130
No, you actually saved us.

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:22.920
We needed more than two people to finish these.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:27.680
Watermelons?

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.640
This portion is one cup's worth of juice that I drank.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.870
Watermelon juice?

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:37.700
Yup, I'll make some for you later.
My signature So Ha Watermelon Juice.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.580
It's really good.

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.700
Here you go.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.460
Thanks.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.830
Thank you.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.810
It's juicy sweet.

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.800
Delish.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.680
Aiko, you're not eating it?

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:18.680
The last time I ever ate such a huge watermelon
was when I was studying for my bar exam.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:27.590
Back then, my dream was to be a lawyer,

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:31.980
and I told myself that I'd do plenty of righteous things.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.180
I ought to apologize to the both of you.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:46.200
It was despicable of me to secretly spy on you and sell you out.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:51.700
I am very sorry. You should be mad at me.

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.850
Well, I can't be trusted in the first place.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:56.980
You're admitting it yourself?

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:00.390
But I trust you.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:08.180
You weren't used to life here, yet you could still smile
while making coffee. That's amazing.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:17.350
And Shirosaki, you're a vet dedicated to opening
your ideal animal shelter. That's admirable.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:18.790
I'm nowhere near admirable.

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:24.060
You're admirable indeed. To flatly reject someone
from investing in the shelter.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.840
That's not a compliment.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.450
So...

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:42.020
I couldn't help but want to support you both.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:48.210
But the fact stands that I went against my boss's orders.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.570
What are you doing?

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:12.150
Didn't you do this when you were little?
A contest to see could spit the seed the furthest.

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:13.480
Did you?

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.690
- Nope, never.
- So did you, or did you not?

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.380
It didn't go as far as I hoped.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.740
Kai, do it.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.880
There aren't any seeds.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.110
What a killjoy.

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:51.300
Oops, he saw the watermelons.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.410
You can't have it.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.380
- No, you can't eat the seeds.
- So Ha, pick them up.

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.450
- Right, seeds... seeds...
- Sorry, boy.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:02.740
Feel free to use the towel if you need to.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:04.470
Got it. Thank you.

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:07.850
I'm bringing Shogun and Sakura out for a walk.

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:10.750
- I'll join in too.
- No, it's fine.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:13.520
I'll leave the two of you to yourselves.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:20.250
I may not look like it, but I have pretty sharp instincts,
so I'll try to be considerate.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:27.120
I leave So Ha in your care.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:34.620
If you're really curious, just go ask Kai about it.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.780
It's good to be straightforward.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.220
It's good... to be straightforward...

00:42:54.990 --> 00:43:01.000
My first love... was you, Shirosaki.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:13.990
You're the one I can't help but think about.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:24.220
Tomorrow when I see Sakura, I'll think of Shogun...

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:31.420
but you'll probably come to mind, too.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.460
It was you back then...

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.570
It's you right now...

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:43.410
And it will always be, you.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.040
I...

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.410
I...

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.020
Wait, Kai.
[Epilogue]

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:19.990
Back then, did you like me?

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.010
Yeah, I did.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:38.000
But you treat me as a friend now, right?

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:46.540
Don't let the chance pass you by again next time.

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.980
Huh?

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.430
I hope you will realize it soon.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.690
So Ha's older sister is...

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:03.280
I like you.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.460
What was that?

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:05.340
Sarang haeyo.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.160
I have been dumped.

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.890
I'm right here.

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:09.930
Aiko...
