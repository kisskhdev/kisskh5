into each other today.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.790
Please, help yourself to the food.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:00.410
Mr. Huang.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:01.700
How is it?

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.740
Brother Xian,

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.790
please, make yourself at home.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.190
I'll step out for a moment
and be right back.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.140
Didn't you get a single word out of him?

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.250
The bullet pierced his lung.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.500
Adrenaline won't help either.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.620
Dr. Tanaka says the bullet
pierced his lung—

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.670
the man's done for,

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.670
not even adrenaline could save him.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.360
Then why even bother?

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.620
Why haven't you touched anything?

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.500
All this was made for you.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.080
Today, we don't leave
until we're drunk!

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:48.860
Come on.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.130
It tastes great.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.370
Help yourself to the meat.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.190
You walked right into the trap!

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.320
Now, look what happened?

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.110
James died

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.640
and I nearly got tricked down with him.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.390
Are you satisfied now?

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.680
Yang Chang,

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.790
we're not like you—
with food and drink assured.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.390
Not going would have meant
waiting to die anyway.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.750
We had no choice.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.600
Shh...

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.340
Who is it?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.730
Who's there?

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.500
I'm David,

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.810
the secretary of the British Consulate.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.820
It's the note we sent
asking the Consulate for help.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.460
So,

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.690
the money I took from you that day—

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.120
that was all you had at that time.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.910
And you gave it to me
without holding back a single cent?

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.890
That's all in the past now.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.320
That's something
I can't just let go of.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.700
Brother Xian, if it weren't for your
extraordinary generosity back then,

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.960
how could I have gotten the funds
to flee to Macau,

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.960
to rebuild, to make something of myself

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.000
and reach where I am today?

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.460
Yeah,

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.580
I... I really never expected it either.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.110
Brother Xian, you're the real deal.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.620
From now on,

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.910
as long as I, Huang Gongjie, am in Macau,

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.910
you will live in comfort.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.460
Have a drink!

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.080
Come on, cheers.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:31.810
I... I can't really drink.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.600
Even half a glass gets me drunk.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.390
Then have some food—

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.990
go on, help yourself. Eat up!

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:48.670
Mr. He,

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.600
where are you from originally?

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.250
Do you have any family still there?

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:55.820
What other businesses were you in

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.670
before the bank?

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.560
I'll say it again.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.580
I will not say it again.
I don't want your cursed money.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.670
I want to live.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.200
To live! Damn it!

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.200
I'm sorry.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.700
Since Japan declared the war,

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.170
the Empire's presence
across Southeast Asia

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.820
has completely collapsed.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.410
Our consulate is now

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.500
under full surveillance
by the Sawa Agency.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.960
We can barely guarantee our own safety,

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.500
let alone arrange

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.360
to secure a passage for your group.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.500
After all this—

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.050
even James's life—

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.820
they just turned their backs on us.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:36.240
For God's sake.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.300
David,

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.170
standing in front of you

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.000
are soldiers of the British Army.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.050
They fought to the death

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:44.320
for the Empire, and then

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.350
the Empire just abandons them?

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.770
The only person willing
to lend a helping hand,

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.770
and who was wrongfully imprisoned

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.170
by the British, might I add,

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.910
is this Chinese person,

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.160
Yang Chang.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.360
Compared to his kindness,

00:15:58.830 --> 00:15:59.690
his tolerance,

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:01.480
and his courage,

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.320
the Consulate and Empire

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.180
should be ashamed of themselves.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.690
So you used to be

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.850
in the grain and oil business before.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.320
That was all years ago.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.010
Captain Huang, it's getting late,

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.410
and I've taken up enough of your time.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:25.670
I should head back now.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.220
No rush. We've only just gotten
to the main point.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.530
Right now, I've got a big deal
on my hands

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.070
and I'm struggling
to find the right person for it.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.950
You're an expert in grain and oil,

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.070
so this deal simply has to go to you.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.790
In my current state,

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.850
how could I possibly handle any deal?

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.100
Captain Huang,
my family is waiting for me.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.230
I really must go.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.220
Don't be in such a hurry.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.980
You must hear me out—

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.530
I'm sure you'll be interested,

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:51.190
alright?

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.480
What does Macau lack most right now?

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.690
Isn't it grain?

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:57.720
And do you know

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.780
why people in Macau are going hungry?

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.450
It's because the Japanese
have blockaded Macau.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.190
The Imperial Army has sealed off the sea,

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:10.849
but there's still land, isn't there?

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.650
It's said that the grain from Zhongshan
has also been seized.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.109
Do you know who seized it?

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:19.220
Me, Huang Gongjie—

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.520
I seized it single-handedly.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.960
Do you know why the Imperial Army
ordered me to seize the grain?

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.020
It's to starve Macau into collapse,

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.190
to make those foreigners
in the Portuguese Macau government

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.280
surrender completely.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.910
Do you know how much grain
I have in my hands right now?

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.930
Ten million kilograms exactly.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.410
Grain prices in Macau
have already soared seven or eightfold.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.150
Once those foreigners
in the Portuguese Macau government

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.020
finally yield

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.480
and the Japanese lift the blockade,

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.110
we'll ship the grain from Zhongshan

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.520
to Macau and sell it.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.690
How much do you think we'll make?

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.560
First create a famine,

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.040
then sell grain at exorbitant prices—

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.200
that's your business.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.590
Is there any business in the world
more profitable than this?

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.170
I, Huang Gongjie, am a man

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.430
who values loyalty and repays kindness.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.560
I'm handing this deal to you.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.780
Just help me find a buyer,

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.280
and I'll cut you in for 10% of the profit.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.610
With just this one deal,

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:18.870
you could earn back

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.110
ten times what Huilong Bank was worth.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.970
Captain Huang,

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.980
I'm not up to this task.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.110
You'd better find someone more capable.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:27.860
But I've set my eyes on you,
Brother Xian,

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.610
because your credibility is unmatched.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.410
Entrusting this to you
is the only way I'd feel at ease.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.020
Captain Huang…

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:33.870
Brother Xian,

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.830
you're not looking down on me, are you?

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.690
How could I possibly look down on you?

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.560
It's just that this deal
is simply too big.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.240
You'll have to give me some time

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.930
to think it over properly.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:53.280
What if I mess it up

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.740
and hold up your plans?

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.330
You really are a careful man.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.480
Fine, I'll let you think it over—

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.610
but be quick,

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.090
otherwise this golden opportunity

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.090
will be snatched up by someone else.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:08.410
Alright,

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.520
I'll take my leave then.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.280
Wait.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.410
Rong!

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:13.410
Yes, Mr. Huang.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:15.720
It's all set.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:18.020
It's just a little something

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.420
to show my appreciation.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.740
Captain Huang, I can't accept these.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.240
Brother Xian,
let's not stand on ceremony.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.150
Never mind whether we collaborate

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:29.220
on big deals in the future—

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.350
right now you've hit hard times,

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.280
and as your brother,
how could I stand by and do nothing?

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.910
Rong, take the men

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.650
and deliver all these things
to Brother Xian's home.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:35.910
Yes, sir!

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.640
Captain Huang, Captain Huang.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.670
I truly appreciate your kindness.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.150
But "accept no reward without merit"
is the family motto of the Hes.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.300
Processing your withdrawal at that time

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.910
was merely part
of my professional obligation as a banker.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.040
I really can't accept any of this—
the money or the gifts.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:53.650
Brother Xian,
you really are a man of principle.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.450
Fine, if you won't take the money,

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:57.720
I won't insist.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.830
But you have a family depending on you,
both old and young—

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.370
surely you can't let them all go hungry.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.040
If your consulate
really wants to save them,

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.830
maybe I have an idea.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.410
What kind of idea?

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:23.460
Remember those agents searching
through the refugees

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.330
when we entered Macau?

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.380
At that time,

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.930
they were looking for a group

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:32.460
of famous Chinese.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.110
Do you know

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.500
who sent them to Macau?

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.780
You must remember the night

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.280
you escaped to Macau,

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.780
when a ship collided
with a Japanese gunboat. Right?

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.040
Commander Ou Xin

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.870
from the Zhongshan Anti-Japanese
Guerrilla Force—

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.540
he's a big hero.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.430
He rammed the ship to stop the Japanese.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.130
Everybody knows him
in Hong Kong and Macau.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:00.610
But...

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.390
you mean the Communist Party of China

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.200
is protecting those celebrities?

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.240
At the border gate,

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.890
I saw a young man with them
the whole time.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.040
He's the younger brother

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.460
of Dr. Ke from the Kiang Wu Medical Team.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.020
When the gate opened,

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.300
I saw them getting

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.700
into the Kiang Wu Medical Team ambulance

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.040
and leaving.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:29.190
So,

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:35.260
you want us to seek help
from the Communist Party of China?

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.890
But we don't know who they are.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.760
You could try your luck
at Kiang Wu Hospital.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:51.800
This is far enough, thank you.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.970
I live on the boat.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.960
Thank you for coming all this way.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.850
No can do.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.780
Mr. Huang asked me to escort you
all the way home.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.620
I wouldn't dare cut corners on his orders.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.480
What are you looking at?

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.390
What are you looking at? Huh?

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.240
W-What is it?

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:23.890
Qiang.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:24.690
Sorry. Qiang.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.240
Please come in.

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:37.040
Xian,

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:38.460
what's all this…

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.930
I ran into a friend outside.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.330
These are gifts from him.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:42.170
Mr. He,

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:44.000
we've delivered
both the goods and you safely.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.500
We'll take our leave now.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.590
Thank you.

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:49.160
Xian,

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.890
since when do you have friends
like this in Macau?

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:52.930
And so much stuff…

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:54.730
who are these people anyway?

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.130
Father,

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.430
it's not something I can explain quickly.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:59.590
I'll tell you later.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.430
Kiddos, you must be starving.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.170
Come on, there's plenty
of good food here.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:04.540
Here you go.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.850
Wow, so many pastries,

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.130

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.390
-Father, have some.
-Father, Qiwen, have some.

I'm in no hurry.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:12.740
A few neighbors on the boat

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.000
are so hungry they can't even
get out of bed.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:15.610
There are so many things here—

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.000
I'll take some over to them.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:17.740
Alright.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.090
I'll take this, then.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.500
Where are Yu and Yu's mom?

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.540
Take it.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.350
Thank you.

Qiang. Qiang!

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.200
Are you so hungry
you've lost your mind?

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.930
Quick, take it.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:42.540
Qiang?

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:48.960
I'd rather starve to death

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.810
than eat this dirty stuff
from that damned traitor.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.010
What damned traitor?

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.950
Back when I was a runner,

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.040
I saw with my own eyes
how he bootlicked the Japanese.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.040
God only knows how
many of our own people he got killed.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.240
I went to look for them—

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.020
couldn't find them anywhere.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.620
There are too many refugees.

I'm asking you—

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:16.460
who sent all this stuff?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.800
And what kind of people are they?

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.540
Weren't you just calling them "friends"
a moment ago?

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:23.960
And now you have nothing to say?

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.130
Too scared to say,

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.200

What's going on?

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.230
I'm telling you,

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.350
these people are traitors.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.650
You brought all these things back.

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.130
How can you dare say
you knew nothing about what they meant?

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.670
Huang Gongjie insisted.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.740
He said it was to repay the favor I did
by handling his withdrawal back then.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.890
I never wanted them in the first place.

not only soundly defeating the Japanese

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:39.850
but also restoring dignity

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:41.780
for every Chinese person present.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:45.190
The second time was inside the checkpoint—

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.300
facing a search by spies and traitors,

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.540
you saw the danger

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.540
and courageously stepped in to help.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.480
But what impressed me most

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.690
was when you exchanged currency

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.760
for Mr. Ma Wanqi—

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.620
it moved me deeply.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.110
Mr. He,

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.580
that is my impression of you.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.690
Dr. Ke,

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.680
I don't deserve even a fraction

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.260
of the praise you've given.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.190
Even if I were all those things you say,

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:22.620
what difference would it make?

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.090
Am I not still a failed businessman?

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:34.430
Doesn't my whole family
still go hungry?

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:36.040
As a father, don't I still

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:38.090
have to watch helplessly

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.760
as my son's life

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.980
hangs by a thread?

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:49.130
And look at Macau now—

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.400
Japanese invaders, traitors,

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:52.800
robbers, scoundrels,

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:53.670
all running wild

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:55.470
and doing whatever they please.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:57.040
In times like these,

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.060
what right and wrong,
what black and white, is there?

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.140
Mr. He, if you think that way,

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:08.590
let me tell you something.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:11.800
Because you stuck to your principles

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.060
and acted with integrity,

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.110
returning the U.S. dollars to
the Portuguese merchant, Mr. Rodrigues,

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.150
you not only prevented
the remaining resistance supplies

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.880
from being sold to the Japanese

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:21.390
but also secured for Wanqi and others

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:22.000
a lasting source

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.760
to continue supplying materials

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.360
for the resistance effort
within the country.

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:31.410
That really happened?

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.020
Not only that—

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:35.990
because of that act of integrity,

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.780
you directly saved the lives
of countless refugees

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.060
trapped inside the border gate,
who were in imminent danger.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.350
Because of your integrity,

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.550
Mr. Rodrigues chose to change his vote,

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.580
which led the Portuguese Macau government
to agree to open the gates—

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:51.890
and those saved

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.600
were thousands upon thousands
of our fellow refugees.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.050
After hearing all this,

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.990
can you still believe that what you did

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:07.130
was meaningless?

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.650
Today's China:

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.110
its land shattered,

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.370
the nation in peril,

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:23.690
suffering profound,

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.020
the road ahead obscure.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.720
Reality may

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:28.610
be dark for a time;

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.240
evil may

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.690
run rampant for a while.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.480
But as long

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:35.850
as you hold fast to these principles,

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:37.300
you are those

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:38.960
solitary yet unyielding

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.020
sparks of light

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:41.980
in the boundless darkness.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.450
Mrs. He,

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:19.950
I was also among those

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:23.190
who misunderstood Mr. He several times.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.260
Only today did I truly come
to understand—

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.660
completely understand—

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.720
what kind of person he really is.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.240
Thank you both.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.350
Dr. Ke,

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:35.850
thank you.

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.230
Rua de São João de Brito: 9;

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.190
Rua do Padre António: 13;

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.800
Rua de Santa Rita: 35.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.300
No need to list them one by one.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.410
Just give me the total.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:02.200
Yes, sir.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.150
In a single day yesterday,

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:05.590
the 3 major charitable organizations,
including Tongshan Hall,

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.250
collected 314 bodies from the streets—

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:11.370
not counting the epidemic-related deaths
at Kiang Wu Hospital.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:12.580
At this rate,

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.520
today's death toll from starvation

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.050
is expected to exceed 400.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.949
What about Lisbon?

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.960
Same as the previous diplomatic notes.

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:22.850
The Japanese government's reply

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.770
remains that it cannot interfere

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.639
with the military's
normal security operations.

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:27.520
So

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:29.449
Lisbon's diplomacy

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.730
is essentially useless.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.270
Is the Portuguese government just going

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:36.230
to stand by and let the Japanese

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:37.960
do whatever they want in Macau?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.280
Their advice to Macau is:

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:44.050
to avoid the situation

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:46.679
spiraling out of control,

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.850
as long as Portuguese sovereignty

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.060
over Macau is not threatened,

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.520
all other concessions to the Japanese side
can be considered.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:57.930
[Under the threat of Japanese military
force during World War II,]

00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:00.180
[the Portuguese colonial government
in Macau signed a series]

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.860
[of cooperation agreements with Japan.
Not only did they promise]

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:06.000
[to completely suppress all anti-Japanese
organizations and activities in Macau,]

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:09.290
[but they also handed over nearly all
of Macau's foreign trade,]

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.830
[shipping, customs, and even
arms smuggling interdiction rights]

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.010
[to be jointly controlled
by the Japanese.]

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:21.270
Consul Fukue,

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.020
the Governor has personally signed,

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.880
agreeing to all 7 conditions
proposed by your side.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.270
Please expedite reporting

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:29.710
to your command headquarters

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.060
and ensure your military

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.460
lifts all blockades
on Macau immediately.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.220
Rest assured, both of you.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.770
Since Macau has made a wise choice,

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.510
the Japanese Imperial Army

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.980
will naturally respond
with full goodwill.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:42.810
I will

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:45.310
call General Yazaki right now.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:46.890
Wait.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:48.610
Colonel Sawa.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:49.900
Let me see.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.230
The contents here

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.640
seem incomplete, don't they?

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.210
All 7 conditions are present—

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:05.870
how could it be incomplete?

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:07.800
But originally,
this proposal was

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.890
accompanied by 3 additional suggestions

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:11.640
from our side, wasn't it?

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.320
Colonel Sawa,

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:16.140
those 3 were merely suggestions

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.940
and were never included
as part of the conditions.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.470
But if Macau

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.230
is willing to cooperate
with the Japanese Imperial Army,

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.370
why drag its feet

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:27.960
and ignore

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.450
the good and sincere cooperative
suggestions we proposed?

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:32.100
Are these "good suggestions"?

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.160
This amounts to de facto occupation.

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:35.480
If that's the case,

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.350
why not just send troops

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.810
to occupy Macau directly,

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.230
so Portugal

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.620
doesn't have to bear the empty title
of sovereign power in vain?

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.260
The Japanese Imperial Army

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.730
fully respects

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.160
Portugal's sovereignty.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:51.960
What we hope for

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.350
is simply to achieve closer,

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.850
all-encompassing cooperation
with the Macau government.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.780
Go back and tell your Governor

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.410
that what the Empire of Japan wants

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.930
is not just the 7 conditions,

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:06.040
but the entirety—
including the 3 suggestions.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:07.770
Furthermore,

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:14.030
in light of the Imperial Army's
sincere eagerness

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.780
to finalize this cooperation,
the Governor

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.480
must sign within 10 days—

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.890
by 6:00 PM

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.850
on February 18th.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.060
After that, the offer expires.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.100
See you.

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:34.850
These past days,

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:39.140
the Portuguese government
has repeatedly lodged diplomatic protests.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.640
Not only am I, the Macau Consul,
under immense pressure,

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.350
but so is His Excellency

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.980
the Foreign Minister in Tokyo.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.890
We finally compelled
the Portuguese Macau government

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:51.520
to agree to the 7 conditions,

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.950
achieving the results demanded
by the command headquarters.

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.320
Colonel Sawa, what authority do you have

00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:59.710
to unilaterally insist on turning the
3 suggestions into rigid conditions,

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:03.060
forcing the Portuguese Macau government
to sign everything?

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.480
It's impractical

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.610
and a blatant overreach of authority.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:10.240
Colonel Sawa,

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:12.000
how do you

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.500
explain this?

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.330
General, before I explain,

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:23.270
there is something
I'd like you to see first.

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:38.680
This is the "porridge" being distributed
by the MGCC to the refugees.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.180
Twenty days ago,
there were 16 distribution points.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.520
A week ago, it dropped to 7.

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:47.180
Today, only 2 remain.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.080
I sent my men disguised
to queue for 6 hours

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.100
at one of them

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.850
to get this bowl
of what they call porridge.

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:59.730
In other words,
Macau has been drained dry.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.320
Colonel Sawa,

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.460
when you first proposed the plan,

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.060
you confidently stated

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.160
that a month-long blockade at most
would secure a complete victory.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.250
Yet now the blockade
has already lasted 40 days.

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:13.290
The Navy is eager
to redeploy forces southward

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:16.880
and has repeatedly requested to withdraw
from the blockade.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.390
By continuing to tie up the Empire's
precious military resources,

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:23.390
are you so certain
you won't break your promise again?

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.950
Due to the desperate struggles
of those Chinese merchants,

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:27.880
Macau did hold out a few extra days.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:30.620
But those Chinese merchants are now
on their last legs—

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:33.080
they can't possibly produce
any more grain.

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:33.770
General,

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.600
we have now reached

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.230
the final stage
of this contest of endurance.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.630
It all comes down to
who can hold out longer.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:42.270
Since we are firmly
in the winning position,

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.290
why should we abandon the opportunity

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:47.390
to achieve de facto control over Macau?

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:51.450
General.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.290
As long as we hold out

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.310
until the final deadline—February 18th—

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.110
we will secure Macau completely

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:59.640
for the Empire.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:01.980
I guarantee it.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:14.680
[Kiang Wu Elementary School]

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.060
It is indeed
the Old General's handwriting.

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:22.820
Look,

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.540
this signature

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.090
matches perfectly
in every stroke.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.700
We've also been searching all along—

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:31.580
who would have thought

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:32.750
they were right here in Macau.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:34.060
Where is the messenger?

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:34.680
Outside.

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:37.150
He says he's Dr. Ke Lin's younger brother.

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:39.170
You've come from Yan'an?

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:42.470
Where I'm from isn't important.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.390
What matters is

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.090
that we're all Chinese.

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:46.330
Hmm.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:52.350
What are your conditions for the rescue?

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:53.930
To take him back to Yan'an,

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:56.640
or to have him issue statements
condemning the Nationalist government

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.900
and supporting the Chinese Communists?

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.820
Mr. Liang, you worry too much.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.890
We've long assured all involved

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.780
that we impose no conditions
on those we rescue.

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:07.810
Then what's the purpose?

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:09.200
For the sake

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:10.880
of the Chinese conscience—

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:11.990
will that suffice?

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:16.560
What do you need me to do?

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:19.460
We do need your help with one matter.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.460
Please, go ahead.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.620
We've heard

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.270
you're well acquainted
with Mr. Ma Wanqi of Hengfengyu?

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.930
Yes, quite.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:25.840
It's like this:

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.660
once the person reaches Zhongshan,

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.260
we will make proper arrangements.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.700
But with the Japanese enforcing
a complete blockade of Macau now,

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.290
we need to find a secure transfer route

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:35.520
from Macau to Zhongshan

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.600
as quickly as possible.

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:40.730
Mr. Ma, entrusted by you,

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.740
has been providing

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:44.710
certain special supplies to Chongqing.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:46.910
He is well-connected in those circles.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.390
If it's about finding
such a secret route,

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:51.850
I believe he would be
the most resourceful.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:56.960
Okay.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.180
I will speak to him about this.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.680
Wanqi is someone
who puts his heart into any task.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:03.680
If he agrees,

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.020
he will ensure it's handled properly.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.870
Thank you very much, Mr. Liang.

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:10.910
You're Dr. Ke Lin's younger brother?

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:11.730
As far as I know,

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:13.730
Dr. Ke Lin is very close with Wanqi.

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:15.480
Why come to me through you,

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.140
taking such a roundabout way?

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:19.680
I've already

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.610
caused enough trouble
for my brother in this matter.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.770
As for what follows—

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:24.980
especially

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:27.140
the more confidential transfer
and escort work—

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.180
it's neither appropriate

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.560
nor suitable for him
to become too deeply involved.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.770
So, what you're saying

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:33.060
is he's…

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.590
Completely out of the loop.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.520
He doesn't seem like...

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.470
Well,

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.890
perhaps it's best
if he remains outside it all,

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:44.810
to avoid unnecessary trouble.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:46.180
To be honest,

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:47.980
in Macau,

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.390
Dr. Ke Lin is my closest

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.270
and most respected friend.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.530
In times like these,

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:57.910
having a true friend
you can confide in isn't easy.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.600
Rest assured, Mr. Liang.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.330
He's also my own elder brother.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.510
I, too, hope he can
live peacefully and steadily,

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:04.440
fulfilling his role as a doctor.
